00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,920
Birthday Puja
Calcutta, India

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,920
21 March 1994

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:18,210
Every year we have birthdays of various people,
and every year we make a vow that this year

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:26,230
I will not do this or I will not do that.

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:37,480
This is a very good way of seeing how far
we have come in life.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:58,030
Many people who really have achieved a very
great height in their spiritual life did not

7
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:20,290
need a birthday, but every day they felt it's
a birthday to start, to go ahead, to understand,

8
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,640
to learn.

9
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,479
Every day is a new year for them.

10
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:38,469
         
In our own life we see that our surroundings

11
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:44,540
change very slowly.

12
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:56,590
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you are
surprised how the surroundings are not changing.

13
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:13,370
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous
change that is happening within us and without.

14
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,069
         
The whole atmosphere today is governed by

15
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,480
human beings.

16
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:35,330
I don't know how far Paramachaitanya works
it out, but it is for us to open ourselves

17
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,760
to new dimensions in our lives.

18
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:53,510
For example, if we find we still have – through
our introspection – we locate that we have

19
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:02,280
these old, subtle, nonsensical things still
hanging around us, we don't have to vow for

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,390
it.

21
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:15,459
You have to just witness it, and the destructive
path it is taking you to.

22
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,430
Immediately you will give up.

23
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:30,189
You don't have to worry as to put a vow upon
yourself, because now you are samarth, meaning

24
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:43,129
now you are absolutely empowered.

25
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:54,519
Whatever you think is wrong, your attention
itself on it will slowly, gradually remove

26
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:11,769
the doubts 
about having those problems, those connections,

27
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:20,520
conditions and ego that are lingering still.

28
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,860
Definitely you will drop them.

29
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:34,580
With your attention, it will run away.

30
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:44,630
Then you will realize that every day your
attention is getting purified, getting powerful,

31
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,710
getting compassionate.

32
00:04:48,710 --> 00:05:02,220
Normally, whatever reaction you have in your
attention just disappears, and you start witnessing

33
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:18,540
the whole thing, and your power of attention,
through that witnessing force, acts and it

34
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,050
works.

35
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:30,810
It works not only on you, but on everything
that surrounds you.

36
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,930
         
Firstly, through your meditation, in that

37
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:44,270
state of meditation, you expand within yourself.

38
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,570
You stay in the present.

39
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,220
The other day, somebody asked Me, "Where was
Your last birthday?"

40
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,900
I just forgot where it was.

41
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,600
Otherwise My memory is very good, like an
elephant.

42
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,890
But this I forgot.

43
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:26,150
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live in
the present, and you grow, so you forget when

44
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,150
and where this growth has taken place.

45
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:44,080
         
My own growth has been like this, that every

46
00:06:44,080 --> 00:07:02,410
time I go to a place, I find very nice new
people coming in and some of the horrible

47
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,560
ones from the old lot disappearing.

48
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:20,630
It's something like, when the tree grows,
the leaves go on falling and new leaves start

49
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,570
coming.

50
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:36,210
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's something different
I find, that on the tree of Sahaj Yoga very

51
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:49,530
few, very, very few leaves fall off, and you
sometimes face a lush garden of beautiful

52
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,310
people.

53
00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:05,330
To Me, it's like a miraculous fireworks.

54
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:17,870
It starts like a small line and then opens
up into several beautiful patterns.

55
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:32,830
It is impossible to envisage or to visualize
what will happen to us, to Sahaj Yog and to

56
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,650
all of you.

57
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:52,570
I have never learned to imagine things, but
the vision that you see is really remarkable,

58
00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:07,630
is very remarkable, that I see all Sahaja
yogis drenched in divine love and expressing

59
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:25,320
themselves in a very beautiful and very deep
manner.

60
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:42,380
This, when comes in, that really makes your
attention absolutely enwrapped in such divine

61
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,560
bliss that you forget that moment.

62
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,050
         
One of those moments are when you celebrate

63
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,950
My Birthday.

64
00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:00,200
I even forget how many years I have lived
on this Earth.

65
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,750
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three, sometimes
I say I am seventy – I just don't know.

66
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:21,810
Because, as I told you, it does not leave
any mark of time, of date, of years, in that

67
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,260
blissful state.

68
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:33,120
As if sometimes you can think that you went
to see something very beautiful, like Taj

69
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:43,920
Mahal, without knowing what it is, and suddenly
you find such a beautiful building, unexpectedly.

70
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,520
You just get blindfolded, as they say.

71
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
In Hindi, say awak.

72
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,590
You don't know how to express.

73
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,350
You become speechless.

74
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,440
And invariably you'll find, that time you'll
forget the time.

75
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,150
You will forget how you came there.

76
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:20,399
All the story behind all that finishes off
as soon as you see the reality of the vision.

77
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:28,070
         
This reality of the vision is something beyond

78
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:36,340
even My thinking and imagination.

79
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:49,210
I cannot, even now, sometimes, believe that
there are so many Sahaja yogis who have got

80
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:54,460
this subtle knowledge.

81
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,380
I never knew that there are so many seekers,
to begin with.

82
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,980
I never knew that there are such subtle people
on this Earth.

83
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:23,220
All over the world, wherever I went, whether
I went to Nepal or to Brazil, suddenly I find

84
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:31,080
facing so many beautiful seekers.

85
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,320
If you ask Me, "When did You go to Brazil?"

86
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,000
I won't be able to tell you the dates.

87
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,080
I have very bad memory for dates for the same
reason, I think, because every time I see

88
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,290
a vision.

89
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:54,160
And the time also just stops for that moment.

90
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,520
It doesn't express itself.

91
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,880
Nothing is recorded, except for the experience.

92
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:11,710
And this experience is in an abstract form.

93
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,250
You cannot describe.

94
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:24,170
It is beyond words and beyond any description.

95
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:42,300
At that time you really become thoughtless,
and that is the time we have to really enjoy.

96
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,390
         
The greatest curse of modern times is the

97
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:50,700
watch, all the time that we keep.

98
00:13:50,700 --> 00:14:04,860
And all the time we are just seeing the time,
what time it is now, and after two seconds

99
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,360
again also you want to see what is the time.

100
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,320
We have crossed the limits of time – kalatit.

101
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,980
Try to understand why we have crossed, because
time moves according to us.

102
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,420
You can experience it.

103
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:36,490
The other day I was coming from Delhi, and
in My household everybody seems to be very

104
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,430
particular about time.

105
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,760
So they were after My life, "Come along, come
along.

106
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,900
Getting late, getting late.

107
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,960
Now, you can't just get into the plane," this,
that.

108
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,150
All right.

109
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,370
And when I reached there, they said that "The
plane is still waiting.

110
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,170
It's not … it's not necessary for you to
hurry up.

111
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,620
It will take at least fifteen, twenty minutes
for you to go."

112
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,740
So, also this name of "airport" makes people
really jumpy, I should say.

113
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,740
They have to go to the aeroplane means as
if some war is there or I don't know what

114
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,470
it is.

115
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,900
So far, luckily, I have never missed a plane,
never missed a train in My lifetime.

116
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,190
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.

117
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:40,029
I have every time found, invariably, that
the plane itself is waiting for Me.

118
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,820
It won't leave.

119
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:49,370
Like, I'll give you a very interesting example
today, if you are relaxed.

120
00:15:49,370 --> 00:16:09,899
We were in Prague, and we were supposed to
go to Poland via – again same thing happens

121
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,680
to Me with experience I had – via Vienna.

122
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,620
And we had a very great Sahaja yogi with us
who told Me that the plane will be leaving

123
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,420
at eleven o'clock.

124
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,080
And from the airport he rings Me up, "No,
the plane is leaving at 9:30."

125
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:34,520
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes
or I can take two hours, depends on.

126
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
So I was ready.

127
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,580
I just jumped into the car.

128
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:43,640
We reached the airport, but we were late by
fifteen minutes, and the ground lady started

129
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,830
shouting at Me at the top of her voice, "You
people, you are VIPs, you are this, you are

130
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,830
that."

131
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,120
All kinds of things she said to Me.

132
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,589
And this Sahaja yogi could not bear it.

133
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:04,720
And he felt that it was his mistake – he
told Me a wrong time, “That's why this lady

134
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,589
is shouting at my Mother.”

135
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:13,700
He couldn't bear it.

136
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,810
He was very unhappy.

137
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:33,929
So, we went into the aeroplane with this lady
shouting behind, and we saw that the pilot

138
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:38,990
and engineers, they were busy with some correction
of the machinery.

139
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,050
They said, "It is little bit out of order.

140
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
It will be ready."

141
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,180
So we sat down.

142
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:52,510
Now this Sahaja yogi could not bear it, and
his tears started rolling down his eyes.

143
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,420
The another Sahaj yogini, she said, “Brother,
it's all right.

144
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,990
Don't cry."

145
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,000
They were sitting behind Me.

146
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,330
I just turned round.

147
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,810
I said, "It's all right.

148
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,810
Don't worry."

149
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,190
He said, "No Mother, because of me she could
say all these things, you know.

150
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,830
I can't bear it."

151
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,980
And he couldn't stop crying.

152
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:25,440
Within one minute, the sky which was absolutely
open was covered with big clouds like huge,

153
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,370
big elephants walking into the whole area
– very big.

154
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:40,360
All the Sahaja yogis who were standing also
– on the other side, on top of the airport

155
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,450
– saw it happening.

156
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,010
The whole thing became absolutely jet-black.

157
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,300
"Oh, My God," I said.

158
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,300
"See, the tears of this gentleman has such
powers."

159
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:01,120
And then the airport people told us that this
plane is out of order, so we have to get down.

160
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,410
So we got down.

161
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,140
We came back.

162
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:13,090
Then he went to this ground hostess and told
her, "Now, whom should we shout at?

163
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,480
Now the plane is not going, should we shout
at you?

164
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,340
How dare you shout at my Mother and all those
things you said?"

165
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:31,830
But all the people there at the airport, who
were still in … under the same regime style,

166
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,990
got such a fright.

167
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,740
The manager himself walked to Me.

168
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,620
He said, "For your plane there's still five
hours and if you want out we can give you

169
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,580
permission, all of you can go out."

170
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,059
And he took Me by a special way.

171
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:50,490
I couldn't understand this reaction.

172
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,750
So I went out and we did some shopping or
something, and when we came back we were surprised.

173
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:04,780
All the airport was rather stunned by us and
when I walked – that was the only plane

174
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,210
that was leaving – all the traffic had stopped
except for this plane.

175
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:19,830
And when we walked down to board the plane,
the gentleman who was there said, "Mother,

176
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,760
can you help me?"

177
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I said, "How?"

178
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
"I have got a terrible back pain."

179
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,630
I said, "How can I do it?"

180
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,730
Then one lady walked in to say, "Mother, please,
I have pain in my shoulder.

181
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,880
Can you put your hand on that?"

182
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,900
I just put My hand on her shoulder and she
said, "I am feeling all right."

183
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,610
She started lifting her arm.

184
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:50,890
Then I went – I thought I'd better now take
to the aeroplane – when I was walking, the

185
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,540
same gentleman came to Me.

186
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,210
He said, "Why not put hand on my back?"

187
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,610
I said, "I have to board the plane."

188
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,370
He said, "I'll walk with You.

189
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,490
You just put your hand on my back.

190
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm sure I'll be all right."

191
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,160
And we walked together about two minutes or
so.

192
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,130
He said, "I'm all right."

193
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,180
The whole atmosphere changed.

194
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:19,630
It was such a tremendous effect on these people
who have been under a regime and have been

195
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,080
really military-like, and the whole treatment
was so funny.

196
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:35,270
The whole thing changed in such a short time,
and I was amazed how the tears of this Sahaja

197
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,290
yogi has worked this wonder.

198
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:48,860
Now, imagine a moment when tears started rolling
his eyes, that moment just manifested a big

199
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,900
drama.

200
00:21:49,900 --> 00:22:02,470
And, ultimately, what you find is that the
people at the airport became extremely humble

201
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,600
and respectful.

202
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,390
         
So when we start thinking of time and time

203
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:21,600
and time, we have to understand that time
is our slave.

204
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
We are not slaves of the time.

205
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:32,840
There are thousand and one stories I can tell
you how, by delaying in a place, by getting

206
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:42,110
late in a place, by not caring for the time,
I have seen such beautiful manifestations,

207
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:53,960
such beautiful dramas – the art of the divine
power – that I was amazed how people worry

208
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,429
so much about the time.

209
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:11,860
If time is really necessary, if we are all
watching our time every year, as our birthday,

210
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:18,200
and if you think that time is very important,
it is in a way.

211
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:27,040
In these modern times, we really need the
time for meditation, for collective meetings

212
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,830
and for Sahaja Yoga.

213
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:40,780
I know when there was the war of independence
in this country, where My parents fought with

214
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,820
all their tana, mana, dhana [trans: body,
mind, wealth].

215
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,820
That time I remember how they never cared
for anything.

216
00:23:51,820 --> 00:24:02,730
They went all out, because it was very important
to get this country freed from the clutches

217
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,510
of the Empire.

218
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:12,640
And this was so important.

219
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,880
They had to meet somebody at such a point:
that man, supposing, is escaping from the

220
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,460
jail, or there's some sort of a thing on,
they could not afford to miss the time.

221
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:34,220
They could not afford to just neglect that
important time, important meeting, important

222
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,580
discussion, because everything had become
an emergency.

223
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,820
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave them
lectures, but for them, from inside.

224
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:53,680
They were all legendary people, I should say,
the way they fought for their freedom.

225
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,020
         
This is, today, the same situation.

226
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,670
It is an emergency, a very subtle emergency.

227
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:10,670
That nothing is more important than spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

228
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:18,120
If some people will miss it, will not know
about it, we will be responsible for that.

229
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:26,049
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira or
any one of them, there were no aeroplanes

230
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:28,390
to travel.

231
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:35,760
There were not these loudspeakers, also other
communications and televisions and all those

232
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
things.

233
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,860
All these things have come now.

234
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,840
That has been manifested now.

235
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:54,169
It is 
the work of Paramachaitanya.

236
00:25:54,169 --> 00:26:04,690
Through scientists, through other knowledge,
all this manifestation have, has taken place.

237
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:11,190
Also, these people didn't have to face people,
so many, nor did they… were supposed to

238
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,820
give realization to people in such a big number.

239
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:30,200
So all these inventions, all that you see
today as modern ventures which we have got,

240
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,100
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:43,570
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine what
would happen to this world.

242
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,630
         
The first and foremost thing is we have no

243
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,140
peace within our hearts.

244
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,370
We talk of peace.

245
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:58,350
I know of people, who have got awards in peace,
have no peace within their heart, no peace

246
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,140
at all.

247
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:08,590
Unless and until we human beings have peace,
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

248
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,929
It is we who create wars.

249
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,710
It is we who do all kinds of violence.

250
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:23,400
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

251
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:36,440
So, peace can be only achieved by establishing
peace in the hearts of the people.

252
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:45,559
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

253
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,590
You remain in the present.

254
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:57,480
And there, where you'll be amazed, you will
be standing like a rock, because you will

255
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,960
have reality in your hand.

256
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,700
You can work out the way you like.

257
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,520
Actually, I don't work out anything whatsoever,
really.

258
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,419
You may say, "You do this and You do that."

259
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:09,419
I don't.

260
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,360
It's the Paramchaitanya, which works it.

261
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,340
In the same way, it will work for you also.

262
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:24,169
But you must have faith in yourself and absolute
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

263
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,169
Absolute.

264
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:38,490
That's the only way we can achieve this, that
many, many, many people, most of the people

265
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,309
of the world – I wouldn't say all of them
rather difficult to say that, but may be possible

266
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:48,200
– should enter into the Kingdom of God with
us.

267
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,240
That's the most important thing, more than
all these worldly things and more than all

268
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,030
these nonsensical things.

269
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:01,539
         
So the attention should be, "How many people

270
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:11,500
we are going to bring to Sahaj Yog, how many
we are going to save, what are we going to

271
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,290
do about it?"

272
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:22,740
When you have to think about it every morning,
how can you remember the time and date?

273
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:30,430
When you are in emergency now, and you know
that this emergency has to be fulfilled, then

274
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:40,580
how can you just pay attention to all worldly
things, all worldly achievements?

275
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,960
That will take its own course.

276
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,030
You don't have to worry.

277
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,240
That works out automatic, automatically.

278
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:56,200
Only thing where you really need your own
diversion, or your own focusing, is Sahaja

279
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,590
Yoga, in and out.

280
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:05,299
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves, if

281
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:11,150
we want all kinds of physical, mental and
emotional problems being solved, all for our

282
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:19,890
good, why not we come to Sahaj Yoga, where
we don't have to do anything except for raising

283
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:30,470
our kundalini, except for meditating for it
for very little time and to achieve that state

284
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,790
of joy.

285
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,419
         
Today My feelings are really full of joy,

286
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:50,390
full of joy, because now I can see how things
are happening, how one person can produce

287
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,640
thousands and thousands of Sahaja yogis.

288
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:02,380
I saw one miracle, I told once that one seed
has all the thousand trees it is going to

289
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:12,140
produce and when I saw a new technique of
tissue culture, I was amazed that on one little

290
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:20,830
seed there were so many little, little primules
who had come out.

291
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:28,210
In the same way, you are all capable, and
you all can do it, but what is needed is faith

292
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,919
in yourself and also complete sincerity about
Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,150
If that happens today, you have really celebrated
My birthday.

294
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:50,330
If you think that My birthday's important,
that for Me very important is that everybody

295
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,909
gets their spiritual birthday.

296
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,679
         
May God bless you.
