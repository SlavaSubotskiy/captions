1
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:21,371

2
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:25,990

3
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,166

4
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:35,214

5
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:40,489

6
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:48,386
Sahaja Yoga means: "Saha" means "with"; "ja" means "born with".

7
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:52,527
So it is a right; every human being has got

8
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:57,879
to be in union -that is Yoga- with the Divine Power.

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,229
And it's within yourself "Sahaj", born with you, spontaneous.

10
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:06,589
Explain to us what is Kundalini?

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,581
Kundalini as I told you it's a reflection of the Primordial Mother within us.

12
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,138
And she is individually everybody' mother.

13
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:21,171
Now she's anxious to give you your second birth

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:28,120
When she's awakened in the sacrum bone she rises upward and

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,431
crosses through six centres, pierces through your fontanel bone area

16
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,750
and reaches a point

17
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,473
where you get connected connected to All-pervading Power.

18
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:44,248
It's like- you can say that it's like a

19
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:47,081
cord you have to connect to the mains.

20
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:52,236
So, unless and until you are connected to your mains, you do not know what you are!

21
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:57,161
Once you are connected then you start knowing that you are the Spirit.

22
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:01,977
In the same way, it rises when it is awakened- very simple.

23
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:06,957
But for that, you have to have somebody who has, who has the authority

24
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:09,529
to raise it; a spiritual authority.

25
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:14,290
Supposing tomorrow if you get your Realization, you can do it also.

26
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:22,974
What is the relationships between Kundalini and Goddess Athena and Mother Mary?

27
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:27,913
Now "ata", "ata" means, in Sanscrit language, "primordial".

28
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:33,511
So, according to us Athena Athena was the Primordial Mother

29
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,566
and Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother

30
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,836
whom we call as Adi Shakti in Sanscrit language.

31
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:45,786
And Mother Mary is one of the forms of Athena,

32
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:51,160
one of the forms of of this Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,440
How they awakening of Kundalini cures incurable diseases?

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,886
This is the energy which of course in Greece was

35
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:06,794
the bone was called as sacrum, meaning the sacred bone,

36
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:11,517
and the sacrum bone contains this energy within ourselves,

37
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,840
known as Kundalini.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,313
That means the Greeks knew about it.

39
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:22,545
And then when she rises, she passes through your subtle centres, there are six

40
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:27,804
above the Kundalini, and whilst she nourishes those centres

41
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:32,472
and also connects you to the All-pervading Power with is the vital power.

42
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:37,686
So first of all, she nourishes those centres that's how you get cured

43
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:40,390
physically, mentally, emotionally.

44
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,179
All our problems come from human beings

45
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,939
and the human beings' problems come from their centres.

46
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,003
So if these centres are nourished, they're alright. That is how it works.

47
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:55,229
And then it connects to this All-pervading Power

48
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:58,177
which we call as the Divine power

49
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:02,767
which does all the living work like these flowers; everything come from that.

50
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,887
So all the time it is flowing within us.

51
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:10,010
 So we don't get sick, we don't feel tired, we don't get old.

52
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,774
May this philosophy offers solutions to our society's problems

53
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:17,520
and create a better or a new world?

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,733
Yes, of course because what's wrong with us, I just now told you,

55
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:25,429
is all these problems coming from human beings

56
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:28,719
because they are ignorant and they are blind.

57
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,233
But once they get the light, they become like angels.

58
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:37,510
And when all these angels will come back, then, there will be no problem.

59
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:44,197
All our society is ruined because we have no idea to the aim of our life.

60
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:48,959
The aim of our life is to become the Spirit, to have the Self-knowledge.

61
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,442
And once you have Self-knowledge, you are surprised to see

62
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:58,016
how dignified you are and how glorious you are within yourself.

63
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:01,274
Once you discover that,
all these things drop out

64
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,127
and you become a wonderful person. And also about others,

65
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:10,278
because also you develop a new awareness a new dimension

66
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:12,922
which we call as Collective Consciousness

67
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,835
by which you can feel the centres of others

68
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:20,466
Now, if you know how to cure these
centres, you can cure others also.

69
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:21,059
Thank you.

70
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:23,219
May God bless you.
