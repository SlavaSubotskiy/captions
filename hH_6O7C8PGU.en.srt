1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,600
Happy Easter to all of you!

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,930
It's a great day to come to Rome

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,180
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,300
Now we have to do the resurrection of Christianity,

5
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,850
which is just moving in the opposite direction

6
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,760
of Christ's resurrection.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,600
As you know that Christ was

8
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,600
just chaitanya,

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,060
but He came in the body

10
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,510
of chaitanya.

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,140
The whole body was made of chaitanya,

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,060
and He resurrected Himself

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,350
to show to the world

14
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,100
that you can resurrect yourself also,

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,560
if you can fill your body with chaitanya.

16
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,300
There is always a struggle between the matter and the spirit.

17
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,390
In human life what we see

18
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,140
that matter is all the time trying to take over the spirit.

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,220
And that is how we fail in our resurrection.

20
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,260
We fail in our resurrection

21
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,350
because we give way to matter.

22
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,890
We have come from matter - easy to go back to matter.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,720
But all the christian nations

24
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,680
have taken to the material development -

25
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,300
identification with the matter, not the sublimation of the matter.

26
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,100
Why we have gone wrong is

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,560
because matter has become so important to us.

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,300
We are so much identified with the matter, with our body,

29
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,680
with all that is material for us.

30
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,430
People are so much worried about the material things.

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,430
What I find that the whole culture has become materialistic

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,560
and they're absolutely ashamed about it,

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,350
but still they continue,

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,930
the way it is so shameful and so degrading.

35
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,850
It degrades human beings.

36
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,640
As I have come in the West I see this trend very clearly.

37
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,060
For example, in a household

38
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,680
whatever they purchase is for sale, all the time.

39
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,720
So whatever they will purchase, they will see to it

40
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,390
that it should be of a certain standard.

41
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,470
Like it should be,

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,180
if it has to be a diamond, it has to be a perfect diamond,

43
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,430
because it has to be sold again.

44
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,260
If they purchase the house, they are afraid that

45
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,060
we should not spoil it or we should not make it beautiful,

46
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,300
we should not try to do something

47
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,260
that will lower the price of the house

48
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,390
because we like the particular type of decoration.

49
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Everything is for sale.

50
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,850
They never enjoy any matter, you see.

51
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,720
The enjoyment is not there.

52
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Whatever they buy, they think that "can we sell it back?"

53
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:59,310
Say, even about - I've seen even precious stones.

54
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,010
Like in India, everybody can afford to have precious stones,

55
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,720
because the rich will buy the most expensive ones,

56
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,010
then the poor people can buy ordinary ones,

57
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
like silver everybody can have,

58
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,310
because some can have silver which is hundred percent,

59
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,100
some can have little mixed up,

60
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,140
some can have with some other material.

61
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,510
But if you go to any country in the West,

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,680
it has to have the "hallmark", you see.

63
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,640
The hallmark has to be there. Otherwise they'll never purchase it

64
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,180
unless and until there is a hallmark,

65
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,300
there is a hallmark means, it can be resold.

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,100
Now, supposing in India you buy some...

67
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,970
everything without hallmarks ... there's no hallmark,

68
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
but, when you want to sell it also anytime,

69
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,850
I mean, if you have to sell it,

70
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,390
then you go in the market and they know

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,810
what is the intrinsic value of that particular silver

72
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,810
and that's how they pay you.

73
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,350
But we don't have hallmarks.

74
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Now in gold, same thing they do is to have 9 carat gold -

75
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,390
with a hallmark.

76
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,300
What is 9 carat gold? Is not gold at all,

77
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,100
but they'll have a hallmark for that.

78
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,310
And that will be very expensive because you see

79
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,390
they don't have much gold so they put a hallmark

80
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,970
and make it expensive.

81
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,300
The whole economy is that stupidly built towards materialism.

82
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,930
That matter is not for enjoyment but for selling off.

83
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,390
So they do not enjoy anything whatsoever in their lives.

84
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,430
Nowadays I don't know if plastic can be resold or not,

85
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,220
but I have seen people who are even particular about the plastic,

86
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,810
about stainless steel, about anything that they have.

87
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,390
May not be resold but now the, psychologically

88
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,300
they are built in such a manner

89
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,100
that they want to even preserve,

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,100
if there's a plastic thing, even there's a thread,

91
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,100
anything, a pin, they would like to preserve it, you see?

92
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,260
Nothing like throwing out anything.

93
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,300
All these things will lead us

94
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,470
into unhappiness, frustration and stupidity.

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,560
So now they form an anti-culture.

96
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,720
What is an anti-culture? Is nothing

97
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:51,140
but is another form of materialism, which is ugliness.

98
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,390
Like you paint your hair, you become something anti-culture.

99
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,350
If you wear holey pants, then you are anti-culture.

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,300
If you wear dirty clothes, then you are anti-culture.

101
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,220
But also these are sellable.

102
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,300
There are markets and markets where you can get

103
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,100
all dirty clothes, "stone washed" clothes.

104
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,470
All these fashions are coming

105
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,890
from the two sides or two faces

106
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,600
of materialistic attitude of human beings.

107
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,760
And they're unashamed sometimes the way they ask for a few things.

108
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,600
Supposing you know somebody has forgotten a spoon with someone;

109
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,720
so they'll telephone three times, "have you got my spoon with you?

110
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,430
Have you got my spoon?"

111
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,300
Unashamed, there's no culture about it.

112
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,930
While - I don't know - might have been better before -

113
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,300
that what I know about India,

114
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,760
that even now, in a good family, it is always said

115
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,300
that "if somebody's pen is with you, be careful and return it back,

116
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,260
but even if your gold is with someone, don't ask,

117
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,680
it's not done, it's not cultured, it's not sophistication."

118
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,930
But the whole sophistication has become materialistic,

119
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,600
it's maddening, and that maddens the Western mind.

120
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,010
For example, if you have to serve, say wines and things,

121
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,100
you have to have different type of cups,

122
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,100
different types of plates, different type of spoons.

123
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,390
You've got spoons for avocado,

124
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,470
you've got spoons for different things -

125
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,930
I mean, you go on like mad, and if that is not with you,

126
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,260
then they'll laugh at you.

127
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,010
If they'll come to your house, - "O God!

128
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,430
They served us avocado with ice-cream spoons!"

129
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,260
That's the greatest sin one can commit.

130
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:04,300
So the whole idea of sin becomes so materialistic and nonsensical.

131
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,180
So the resurrection cannot take place

132
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,060
when the matter is so dead and gone.

133
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,560
Then this matter enters into the brain.

134
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,300
When it enters into the brain it rots there.

135
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,430
Then you start discussing about, say, banking

136
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,680
or about how to economize this.

137
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,510
I mean the mantra is in London, as I say,

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,560
must be everywhere "save pounds".

139
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,430
As soon as you go to the airport, there is big mantra written

140
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,010
"Save pounds by hiring a taxi at Heathrow".

141
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,810
Just imagine - they are not even aware of what they are doing.

142
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,890
All the time save pounds, save money, save this, save ... for what?

143
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,760
Because they are so frustrated,

144
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,100
the whole material stuff is so frustrating

145
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,180
that they have to save money to get over that frustration.

146
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,430
And the frustration is counterbalanced

147
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:30,300
by drugs or by

148
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,850
drinking wines and all kinds of nonsensical things,

149
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,470
and also rotten cheese

150
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,350
or some sort of a thing that is absolutely a dead matter,

151
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,350
useless thing which makes you dead and sleepy,

152
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
so that you run away from reality,

153
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,640
because you are so frustrated that you want to have something

154
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,180
that will counteract it.

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,760
Then with that also, when they find, it's not done,

156
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,300
still they are extremely annoyed.

157
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,810
So what to do next?

158
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,810
If you are that unhappy you have to find out something else.

159
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,300
As I tell a story about children

160
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,470
who were naughty and the mother was going out,

161
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,310
so she told that "See, you are naughty children,

162
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,300
so I lock you up in the kitchen"

163
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,390
because anywhere else they can break something, spoil something

164
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,390
and she cannot sell them again, perhaps.

165
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,310
So, she puts them

166
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,100
in the kitchen thinking, "What can they ruin there?"

167
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,810
So when she came back, they said, "We ate all your tea leaves!"

168
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,850
Like that, when they get so frustrated,

169
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,930
they don't know what to do, so they put nails into their ears,

170
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,140
pins into their cheeks, something into their nose

171
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,010
- they don't know what to do with themselves, you see -

172
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,300
so they'll pull out their moustaches or they'll paint their hair,

173
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
or do all kinds of funny nonsensical things,

174
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,300
absolutely frustrated people!

175
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,350
But the worst part,

176
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,060
which cannot be understood is, that so confident about it!

177
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,760
They don't do it with any diffidence, it's complete confidence.

178
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,680
Their attention is all over to see "Now, how we should be?",

179
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,140
now if they see a tree which has leaves

180
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,100
which have become absolutely sort of crumpled down

181
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,100
because of malnourishment, so they want to be like that.

182
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,180
They want to become people who have malnourishment.

183
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,890
So they look like miserable people.

184
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,300
Their cheeks are inside, noses outside - sort of thing goes on -

185
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,560
and if you see them, they look like sickly people.

186
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,140
That's the sign of finding out

187
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,300
some way of expression of their frustration.

188
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,180
But Christ paved the way - the other way round.

189
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,300
He said, "Put chaitanya into your matter",

190
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,600
so you'll enjoy that chaitanya.

191
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,300
Put chaitanya, the vibrations, into the matter.

192
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,390
This is His message.

193
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,850
He didn't get resurrected only like His spirit going out,

194
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,100
but the whole His body resurrected Himself.

195
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,390
So He's talking about

196
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,470
the resurrection of the body, of the matter, within us.

197
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,180
In Sahaja Yoga also when we come in, kundalini rises,

198
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,600
She gives you realization, you do feel the chaitanya

199
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,640
in your hands, you feel it all around,

200
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,010
your faces shine like beautiful lotuses,

201
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,100
your skin improves, you look blooming, everything is fine,

202
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,810
but still there are material attachments,

203
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,470
which may be very subtle, could be very gross.

204
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,510
The gross could be like

205
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,600
"This is my carpet, this is my car,

206
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:55,300
this is my ornament" - something like that.

207
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,430
But if it comes to

208
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,760
the style of Christ,

209
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,390
you have to get identified with the matter which is vibrated,

210
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,260
which is vibrating,

211
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,470
which has got vibrating value -

212
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,640
not material value but vibrating value,

213
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,640
spiritual value, divine value.

214
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,760
Could be anything - could be flowers, could be water,

215
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,930
could be a sari, could be a seat, could be anything

216
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,970
that becomes valuable.

217
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,680
So attention starts shifting from gross to vibrations.

218
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,890
But, even now if you have the lurking

219
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,680
attention into material things,

220
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,600
then it's difficult for you to rise fast.

221
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,140
Everything that you use,

222
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,470
is it helpful for your vibrations or not?

223
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,600
Everything that you do, is it good for your vibrations or not?

224
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,300
Or is it the same old fashion you are carrying?

225
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,470
Like the mad people I saw yesterday - they had come for holiday

226
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,310
and they didn't know how to enjoy,

227
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,300
they were trying everything, you see.

228
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,100
They must have paid lots of money to their tourism,

229
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,970
poor things, they must have paid lots of money in the hotels,

230
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,430
they must have paid lots of money in the restaurant,

231
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,180
but I felt they were not enjoying at all,

232
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,600
none of them were enjoying - they were miserable

233
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,560
and they didn't know what to do.

234
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,680
And at the end of it I was thinking, that they might just go

235
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,260
and break their heads with frustration.

236
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,010
So matter can never give you joy.

237
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,220
Only the matter that is vibrated,

238
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,890
that has vibrations, can give you joy.

239
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,430
A human being can never give you joy,

240
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,100
may be your wife, may be your children,

241
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
may be your father, mother or anyone,

242
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,300
unless and until that person is, has got vibrations,

243
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,100
because joy is the blessings of God.

244
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,100
And unless and until you have connected with God,

245
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,300
whatever you may try, whatever you may acquire,

246
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,890
you can never have that joy.

247
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,850
You may have that artificial confidence,

248
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,810
because a person who is frustrated has to say

249
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,720
- show outside that - "Oh no, I'm not frustrated. I am very happy."

250
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,260
It's like to be tense and say, "I'm very relaxed" - it's like that.

251
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,260
So, they may just, for keeping up the images,

252
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,180
might say that "We are very confident",

253
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,300
but they're very diffident people. They are weak.

254
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,350
So it could be your children, it could be anyone, any human being.

255
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,390
Maybe you might think too much of that person,

256
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,560
you may be very much identified with that person,

257
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,100
you may think that this is the greatest thing,

258
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,010
greatest person you have ever met, it cannot give you joy.

259
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,560
But an ordinary person, a laborer,

260
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,760
maybe a beggar, maybe somebody, a Sadhu,

261
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,760
sitting alone in the forest,

262
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,510
will be such a joy-giving personality.

263
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,510
He may speak, may not speak, will be such a precious,

264
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,850
valuable thing for you,

265
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,300
than a person who is rich, well placed, highly adored.

266
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:17,970
That's where Christianity has failed, coveting with the kings.

267
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,430
Now this Mr. Pope here, my husband went and saw him

268
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,760
and the Pope was very nice to him because he is, comes from a,

269
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,810
he's a big man in the material world. He won't see Me!

270
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,300
Or I may not see him!

271
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,390
So the whole value system, the whole value system has to change,

272
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,930
and that value system is

273
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,680
that you care for nothing else but for your spirit.

274
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,220
Nothing matters but the spirit.

275
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,300
The spirit gives you the comfort of a palace.

276
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,600
It gives you the bliss of all the protection.

277
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,180
It gives you the joy of all the relationships of the world.

278
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,300
Then why should you care for something which is no good?

279
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,220
You can see it so clearly.

280
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:44,310
If you have your vision clear, you can see it so much around you,

281
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:55,140
that these people look so unhappy, so miserable,

282
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,470
running after this, running after that.

283
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,300
Now first they were hippies, then they became punks,

284
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,100
now they're becoming well-dressed gentlemen.

285
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,220
Everything is from this to that, to that to this,

286
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,140
leading them nowhere whatsoever.

287
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,060
So clearly you see that you are away from them.

288
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,140
You are in a different realm and you see them.

289
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,810
So don't go near them.

290
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,560
Try to show that

291
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,970
beauty in you, so that they come to you

292
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,220
and see for yourself, see for themselves,

293
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,300
that you are resurrected people, you are resurrected.

294
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,760
Spirit is always there in your heart,

295
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:56,640
always there, watching you, seeing you,

296
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,100
but now because the matter that surrounds the spirit

297
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,760
is being resurrected, is being vibrated,

298
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,300
your eyes shine, your skin shines,

299
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,100
your face shines, you look so beautiful -

300
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,510
that is what is resurrection.

301
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,640
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no place for stupid seriousness.

302
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,310
What are you serious about?

303
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,300
"Oh, I have to sell my diamond and you know

304
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:39,310
they said there's a little black in it."  So what? Wear it!

305
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:48,600
All this seriousness comes from the dead matter in your head,

306
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,390
and you know on the dead grows the fungus,

307
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,350
and also you know that this fungus gives you all kinds of diseases.

308
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,010
So keep away from all that is dead.

309
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,100
Only the chaitanya makes

310
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,310
the matter vibrate,

311
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,890
and unless and until you are connected with God,

312
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,680
you cannot vibrate anything.

313
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,930
Those great saints, prophets, incarnations who came on this earth

314
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,140
tried to tell this to all of us, that "get connected with God".

315
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,010
Everybody said the same thing.

316
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,300
Of course I have done the job Myself!

317
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,970
That's good, they're appreciating it.

318
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,060
And you have to just think about it that

319
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,260
this connection should not be loose, it should not be disturbed,

320
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,970
it should not be doubting. Fix it up properly.

321
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,970
Then you will never lose it for anything whatsoever like

322
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,760
"My wife is like this, my husband is like this,

323
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,600
my brother is like this".

324
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,560
These are the signs of very weak personalities.

325
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,470
If you are a strong personality,

326
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,600
with those vibrations if you are strong,

327
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,510
then you make the other person also stronger

328
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,510
and bring the other person into Sahaja Yoga

329
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,140
and give him the nectar of life.

330
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,510
So today is the message that we have to resurrect

331
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,600
our matter, within and without.

332
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
So you are raising your kundalini upward, is all right.

333
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,560
Also you have to spread it - horizontally -

334
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,600
to your hands, to your feet,

335
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,430
to your body, to your face, to your thought, to everything.

336
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,600
What is a mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated.

337
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,930
Any thought that is vibrated is a mantra,

338
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,930
but the vibrations can only be carried by a particular type of,

339
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,390
or we can say a particular coefficience is needed.

340
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,060
In dress, in thinking,

341
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,510
in anything that is worldly,

342
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,970
there is a kind of a coefficience that works out the vibrations.

343
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,180
If that coefficience is not there, you cannot catch the vibrations

344
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,430
and you cannot also give vibrations.

345
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,560
So there are only two divergences,

346
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,180
one is the left, another is the right; there are not too many:

347
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,310
very easy to get rid of them.

348
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:12,220
There are only two turns in Italy, one is right or left.

349
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,300
So in the same way within us

350
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,930
if you don't go to the left and you don't go to the right,

351
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,850
you keep in the center,

352
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,010
you are vibrated! You can vibrate everything!

353
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,640
But to keep in the center, not to go to any extremes.

354
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,760
Even in Sahaja Yoga there are people like mad,

355
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,390
they meditate for twelve hours.

356
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,890
What is there to meditate for twelve hours?

357
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,600
I mean you are already in meditation.

358
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,850
Or else they will make a picnic out of Sahaja Yoga.

359
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,930
One extreme to that.

360
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,060
What is needed is to think that,

361
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,430
"I am the spirit and I am connected with God.

362
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,300
How much am I connected? How much I am sucking in?

363
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,600
How much I am getting to it?"

364
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,260
That's all.

365
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,430
You don't have to do too much about it.

366
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,100
Those days are gone when people used to break their heads,

367
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,260
stand on their heads or go to Himalayas.

368
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,060
But peculiarities in temperament

369
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,100
is not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

370
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,010
All the peculiarities come from the matter.

371
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,180
So a peculiar person in Sahaja Yoga,

372
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,300
maybe he might be bhootish or he might be egoistical.

373
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,180
One of the two things in a peculiar person.

374
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,810
There are no peculiarities in a sahaja yogi.

375
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,560
There are individualities, but not peculiarities.

376
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:59,010
Means everybody will have the nose that he had, it won't change,

377
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,970
he'll have the eyes which he had,

378
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,680
but there will be a light in the eye.

379
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,100
In the same way we can see about our clothes -

380
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,600
we start wearing sober clothes,

381
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,140
but not pale clothes or dirty clothes:

382
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,100
we wear colorful things because we are colorful.

383
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,220
At Sahasrara there are seven colors.

384
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,760
Today I wore this color,

385
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,180
because this is the color of spring in India,

386
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,220
because all the flowers are yellow

387
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,560
and there is also mustard which is yellow

388
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,010
and this is called as a color of the spring.

389
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,100
In Indian culture, you see, there's a day on this

390
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,970
that they wear this particular color to celebrate the spring,

391
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,060
because we're very sort of connected with the nature.

392
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,100
So today we have received a very nice message

393
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,890
from New York as if they have dreamt that I'm going to wear

394
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,350
a color of the spring,

395
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,510
so I wish somebody could read it out to you

396
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,100
what they have said, and you will be surprised how it tallies,

397
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300
how it tallies with what I'm wearing today -

398
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,600
and as soon as I wore this sari

399
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,560
the thing became hot and I knew this would be.

400
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,810
That is the moment it became hot and I'm sorry for that,

401
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,390
because you are finding it rather too much.

402
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,890
So, today is a day to celebrate the spring

403
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,510
and as you know I was born in spring

404
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,430
and that Christ was resurrected in spring.

405
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,390
So the spring starts after the resurrection of Christ.

406
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,220
In the same way we are now in the spring mood,

407
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,680
to enjoy, to be happy,

408
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,180
to be just blissful.

409
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:03,470
But not to be frivolous, not to be vulgar, not to be childish.

410
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,390
That's the way a Sahaja Yogi should be!

411
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,680
And I'm very happy that at this spontaneous arrangement of Mine

412
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,310
to come to Rome, so many of you have come.

413
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,390
It shows how much you love Me and I can't express really

414
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,720
what I feel about the whole thing,

415
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,300
except for tears coming to My eyes.

416
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,720
For whatever Christ has sacrificed His life,

417
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:38,560
which was a terrible thing to happen, that He sacrificed His life,

418
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,810
He suffered so much,

419
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,510
but the outcome of that is you - all of you here -

420
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,470
who are resurrected today and your Agnyas are cleared,

421
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,760
and everything is so very fine.

422
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:57,140
May God bless you!
