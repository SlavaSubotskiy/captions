1
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:10,533
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

2
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:14,653
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

3
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:19,693
on this day of Sahasrara.

4
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:39,853
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

5
00:00:40,013 --> 00:00:42,933
and new has started.

6
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:56,213
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

7
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:02,853
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

8
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,253
And gradually –

9
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:28,933
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

10
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:37,533
and gradually moving towards the completion,

11
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:46,533
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

12
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:05,453
It is a very natural process of growth

13
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,653
that you have gone through.

14
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:19,173
The first one was, we can say,

15
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:24,093
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

16
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:34,813
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

17
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:44,333
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

18
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:49,373
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

19
00:02:55,733 --> 00:03:00,093
And you have the chakras same way built in,

20
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:03,253
in your Sahasrara.

21
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:16,613
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

22
00:03:16,773 --> 00:03:20,813
the deities in your centers,

23
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:28,533
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

24
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:42,813
But now the time has come for us to spread it

25
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:47,013
on a horizontal level.

26
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,333
And to move it on the horizontal level,

27
00:03:56,493 --> 00:04:00,573
we have to understand how to go about it.

28
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:18,413
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

29
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:24,133
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

30
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:27,213
of the chakras.

31
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:40,253
And when we start it from the back,

32
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:44,733
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

33
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:54,333
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

34
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:57,573
if you see it clearly.

35
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:24,013
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

36
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:28,613
because it's a concave replacement,

37
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:35,453
is important to understand that the center

38
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:45,533
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

39
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:08,973
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

40
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:29,133
I hope you understand what I mean.

41
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:38,533
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

42
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:44,573
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

43
00:06:54,853 --> 00:07:02,573
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

44
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:07,093
the Atma, coincide.

45
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:21,253
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

46
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,813
that is the Atma.

47
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:40,613
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

48
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:55,693
At this point of time it is very important to understand

49
00:07:55,853 --> 00:08:01,493
that we have to take a bigger step.

50
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:19,373
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

51
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:24,453
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

52
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:35,733
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

53
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:59,293
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

54
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:04,853
of all the incarnations is compassion,

55
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:10,933
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

56
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:28,933
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

57
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:33,973
we have to have compassion.

58
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:50,093
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

59
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:58,013
If God Almighty had no compassion,

60
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:07,133
He would not have created this great universe.

61
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,973
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

62
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:23,133
is the embodiment of His compassion.

63
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:36,773
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

64
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:43,773
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

65
00:10:54,133 --> 00:11:00,013
And compassion is always completely covered

66
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:03,173
with forgiveness.

67
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:18,053
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

68
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:27,173
The Son of God is forgiveness,

69
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,533
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

70
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:41,453
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

71
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:44,933
the Mother who is the compassion

72
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,173
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

73
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:54,133
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

74
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:20,413
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

75
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:34,213
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

76
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:48,933
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

77
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,253
as you think it to be,

78
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:57,253
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

79
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:11,773
To develop this, you have to pay attention

80
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:18,173
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

81
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:36,373
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

82
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:43,693
then there you must establish the deity.

83
00:13:55,133 --> 00:14:01,933
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

84
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,573
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

85
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,573
in person with you.

86
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:30,933
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

87
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:34,973
had to imagine the deities,

88
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:49,013
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

89
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:59,693
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

90
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:07,693
that is how it is described –

91
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:13,133
so if you also see the person,

92
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:16,253
you may not be knowing fully that person

93
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:20,613
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

94
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,133
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

95
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:34,013
than your imagination.

96
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,813
That is why one has to surrender.

97
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:51,613
With your limited imagination of brain,

98
00:15:51,773 --> 00:15:57,253
one cannot see the deity.

99
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:06,613
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

100
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:11,693
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

101
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,093
So the devotion has to be there,

102
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:24,453
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

103
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:27,293
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

104
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,613
Heart should be clean.

105
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:42,933
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

106
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:54,733
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

107
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,733
of reality,

108
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:04,773
but reality is absolute.

109
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:11,613
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

110
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:18,733
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

111
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:31,733
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

112
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:36,573
not with very clean heart.

113
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:47,933
At that time we had lots of attachments,

114
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:55,013
we were identified with false things.

115
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:03,413
And also we thought by getting realization

116
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:07,773
we’ll become very powerful people.

117
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,933
After realization also,

118
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:24,933
we started indulging into petty things.

119
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:37,173
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

120
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,493
mothers, sisters;

121
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:48,333
and the women thought of their husbands

122
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:53,533
and their brothers, children.

123
00:18:56,613 --> 00:19:01,533
They all asked for the blessings of all those

124
00:19:01,693 --> 00:19:05,613
with whom they were entangled.

125
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:21,693
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

126
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:35,773
Now the job of a Avatara is such

127
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:41,893
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

128
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:53,293
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

129
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:59,533
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

130
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:17,613
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

131
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:19,493
“we want You to be with us,

132
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:23,493
individually with every one of us.”

133
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:36,173
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

134
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:41,293
and He was with every one of them.

135
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:52,013
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

136
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:57,173
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

137
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,453
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

138
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:05,253
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

139
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:08,493
whatever was possible.

140
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:17,533
Also the kshema that you asked for,

141
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,933
ashrams you asked for,

142
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:24,213
all the things that you needed,

143
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:31,933
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

144
00:21:42,173 --> 00:21:44,373
So at the Krishna's level it was

145
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,613
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

146
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:51,453
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

147
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:04,173
because it was promised.

148
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:10,373
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

149
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:19,573
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

150
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:28,773
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

151
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:48,253
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

152
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:55,693
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

153
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:04,853
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

154
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:10,013
may dim out, or may be defective.

155
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,773
So, all the chakras that are within us

156
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,933
are to be looked after.

157
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:37,093
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

158
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:43,333
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

159
00:23:58,493 --> 00:24:02,573
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

160
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:11,053
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

161
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:16,053
establish Him through your thought –

162
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:19,733
because now your thought is divine –

163
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:24,733
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

164
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:52,093
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

165
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:55,613
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

166
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,133
of these things to you, of …

167
00:24:57,293 --> 00:25:03,813
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

168
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:15,173
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

169
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:19,173
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

170
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:23,333
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

171
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,293
And that's the country.

172
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:38,333
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

173
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:43,453
put your feelings towards Him,

174
00:25:51,173 --> 00:26:00,093
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

175
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,533
And then to manifest compassion,

176
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,573
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

177
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:18,373
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

178
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:23,493
to all the people of the world."

179
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:36,893
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

180
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:41,573
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

181
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,653
you have no right to ask.

182
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:59,493
So to understand innocence

183
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:02,133
you should try to understand yourself,

184
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:06,213
how your mind is working.

185
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:18,893
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

186
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:22,053
should possess that person?

187
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:27,573
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

188
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:31,653
comes into your mind?

189
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:48,013
For an innocent person,

190
00:27:48,173 --> 00:27:51,773
a beautiful person, or a woman,

191
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:56,133
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

192
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:59,133
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

193
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:02,173
there’s no thought.

194
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:19,773
So if there is no thought, there's no question

195
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:23,053
of having any expression of possessiveness

196
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:27,133
or any kind of a baser feeling.

197
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:46,173
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

198
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:49,893
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

199
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:55,133
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

200
00:28:55,293 --> 00:29:05,093
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

201
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:25,893
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

202
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,933
they feel I am innocent."

203
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,773
This is compassion,

204
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:46,253
the compassion to ask Him to give you

205
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:51,333
the power of compassion itself.

206
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:08,933
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

207
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:16,053
the light starts moving horizontally;

208
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:34,573
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

209
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:42,253
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

210
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:49,373
You don't become stupid or childish,

211
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,613
but you become child-like.

212
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:07,733
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

213
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:15,293
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

214
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:20,413
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

215
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:27,373
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

216
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:30,373
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

217
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,213
to impress others.

218
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:44,053
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

219
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:51,133
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

220
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:54,453
of deliberations.

221
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:10,933
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

222
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:23,853
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

223
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:29,733
expressing itself on horizontal level,

224
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:34,013
that you become discreet.

225
00:32:42,693 --> 00:32:45,173
But that is a power, I'm again say,

226
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:49,333
the power of discretion you develop.

227
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:57,213
Now one must understand the difference between

228
00:32:57,373 --> 00:33:02,213
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

229
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:09,293
So “the power” means it acts.

230
00:33:13,773 --> 00:33:16,773
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

231
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,733
but if you are standing somewhere

232
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:24,853
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

233
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:37,613
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

234
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:41,253
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

235
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:46,413
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

236
00:33:57,613 --> 00:34:06,053
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

237
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,893
that acts by itself.

238
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,773
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

239
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:14,173
but you just become the vehicle,

240
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:19,133
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

241
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:35,493
Then you should believe,

242
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:39,613
now you are spreading horizontally.

243
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:53,013
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:57,853
you needed to see Me in person.

245
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:02,533
You needed to see Me in person.

246
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:12,253
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

247
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:16,533
You wanted the target in front of you.

248
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:29,773
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

249
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:33,813
whatever is to be achieved.

250
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:39,373
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

251
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:43,413
So now when you wanted that all the time,

252
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:49,133
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

253
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:54,133
when you had that in person before you.

254
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:08,493
Then in the second era, now,

255
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:14,053
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

256
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:17,613
you'll take it over from Me.

257
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:36,813
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

258
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:46,013
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

259
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,773
I am with you, you know that;

260
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,733
but need not be in this body,

261
00:36:56,893 --> 00:37:01,773
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

262
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:11,293
But once this desire starts working,

263
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:16,173
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

264
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:27,373
When the child is born to a mother,

265
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:31,933
automatically she gets milk.

266
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:43,933
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

267
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:49,213
In your divine desire also it is connected.

268
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:03,253
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

269
00:38:05,893 --> 00:38:07,813
So you may find Me anywhere:

270
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:09,893
you are walking on the street,

271
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:14,133
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

272
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:30,733
So this is the second era we have started,

273
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:33,173
and you should not be shocked

274
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:37,013
if you see Me sitting on your bed

275
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:41,933
and putting My hand on your head.

276
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:02,013
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

277
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,213
walking into your room,

278
00:39:09,573 --> 00:39:12,973
or as Shri Rama.

279
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:16,933
That has to happen,

280
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:20,133
so you should be prepared.

281
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:30,693
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

282
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:33,933
but on a grosser level.

283
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:41,813
We have seen the light coming on My head,

284
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:46,733
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

285
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,773
But many things will happen,

286
00:39:55,933 --> 00:40:00,893
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

287
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:12,453
This has to happen, just to convince you

288
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:18,053
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

289
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:24,293
in the new area of Pragyalok.

290
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:35,893
Because this is a new state into which

291
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:41,013
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

292
00:40:47,773 --> 00:40:55,933
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

293
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:12,733
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

294
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:19,493
The asking will disappear,

295
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:25,813
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

296
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:34,813
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

297
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:48,173
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

298
00:41:56,053 --> 00:42:06,093
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

299
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:16,253
Now the new work of compassion,

300
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:22,573
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

301
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:38,733
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

302
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:45,813
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

303
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:58,773
So you become the giver of compassion.

304
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,253
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

305
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:11,573
I have requested you how to do tapah.

306
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,773
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

307
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:35,453
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

308
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:41,293
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

309
00:43:57,693 --> 00:44:00,973
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

310
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:03,573
that you have to do, because I am told

311
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:09,573
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

312
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:12,173
and you people suffered a little bit

313
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:16,333
on your way for the pilgrimage.

314
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:35,333
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

315
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:38,893
where the devils dare not go.

316
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,453
Fun: no word!

317
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:50,693
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

318
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:10,453
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

319
00:45:10,613 --> 00:45:13,813
discomforts, then you should know

320
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:16,093
you are on the right lights.

321
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:33,853
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

322
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:37,853
you should know you are progressing well.

323
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:47,213
As you become more peaceful and your temper

324
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:51,333
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

325
00:45:51,493 --> 00:45:57,493
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

326
00:46:16,093 --> 00:46:24,733
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

327
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:29,653
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

328
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:33,253
then know that you are progressing.

329
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:44,293
No amount ….

330
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:53,693
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

331
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:57,693
then know that you are progressing.

332
00:47:05,773 --> 00:47:14,613
No amount of material well-being in others

333
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:19,653
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

334
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:23,773
then know that you are progressing well.

335
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:38,413
No amount of

336
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:47,253
labor or

337
00:47:48,373 --> 00:47:59,413
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

338
00:47:59,573 --> 00:48:03,973
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

339
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:10,173
while you have got it without any effort.

340
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:14,213
So you are something special.

341
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:27,213
So this, once you understand that you are special,

342
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:31,373
you will become humble about it.

343
00:48:36,853 --> 00:48:42,533
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

344
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:45,333
when you see you have achieved something,

345
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:47,573
that you have some powers,

346
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:53,493
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

347
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:58,213
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

348
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:02,453
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

349
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:05,853
then you should believe

350
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:10,893
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

351
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:36,533
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

352
00:49:36,693 --> 00:49:46,173
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

353
00:49:57,253 --> 00:50:03,493
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

354
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:06,613
you will be in meditation;

355
00:50:12,013 --> 00:50:17,573
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

356
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:34,453
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

357
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:40,373
This is what you are in for;

358
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:46,573
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

359
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:50,773
on this great day of Sahasrara.

360
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:05,053
May God bless you all.
