1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:15,089
Acupuncture is actually is the tapping of
the power which is already within us.

2
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,330
Now for example, you have a certain power
in your stomach.

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,590
All right?

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:29,080
Now this power is continuously supplied to
your other organs in the stomach.

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
All right?

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,500
It is used for that.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,499
Now through the sympathetic nervous system,
the parasympathetic stores it and the sympathetic

8
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,749
uses it.

9
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:45,670
Now supposing there is a disease in the stomach.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,519
So now the energy in that, vital energy, in
that particular center, is sort of exhausted

11
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,300
or is much less.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,620
So what do they do?

13
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,999
How to get well that person?

14
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:05,540
They take from another center, divert it,
and put it there.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,310
And that’s how, you did try to cure that.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:17,470
But by that they create an imbalance because
you have a limited area, you have a limited,

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,880
absolutely limited, energy.

18
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,350
Now this limited – supposing you have a
limited petrol and another car you find whose

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,700
petrol is all finished.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,289
Now if you push the petrol into another car
maybe that car will go half way and you will

21
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:35,969
also go half way and finished.

22
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,000
You understand my point?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,009
So both of them reduce your longevity.

24
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,759
So it is the extraction of the energy which
is within us, which is limited.

25
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,299
Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

26
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:56,310
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini rises and connects
you with the all-pervading power.

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,100
So all the time you are getting power, the
vital power within you flowing.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,509
And there is no sort of death of that power.

29
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,259
It’s all the time flowing, the grace.

30
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:12,370
But here when you tap one energy to another
there’s no proper understanding how much

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,970
to give, how much to balance.

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,190
And there is no need at all.

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,930
Once you are a Realized soul supposing somebody
has a stomach trouble you have to just put

34
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,840
your hand on the stomach, finished.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
This person you can cure.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,909
You can cure cancer, you can cure anything.

37
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,860
Because you become the source of that energy
and your energy is not limited, you are getting

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,920
energy from the All-pervading Power.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,470
You are connected with it.

40
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,970
So what ever you are doing it’s just flowing
like that and you just become a witness of

41
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,080
that power which is flowing.

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,090
So you don’t have to mismanage, mishandle
anybody.

43
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,150
You just look after that part which requires
energy and you raise the Kundalini and give

44
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,909
Realization to that sick person also, so that
he can give it to another.

45
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:03,159
He gets cured, then he can cure others.

46
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,480
It is like that.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:13,049
So tapping this energy was first started in
China when Zen system came into action.

48
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,170
Zen, you see?

49
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,100
Now Zen is nothing but Sahaja Yoga- same thing
as Zen.

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,390
But Zen had only twenty-six Kashyapas in six
centuries.

51
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,099
Kashyapas means Realized souls.

52
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,750
Only twenty-six in six centuries.

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
And now there are none.

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,040
I have met the chairman of the Zen who came
here.

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,280
You see he is a chairman, I don’t know how
he is a chairman.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,439
His Kundalini is just closed on there.

57
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,980
He cannot get Realization I tell you, he is
beyond Realization.

58
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,790
He was sick so they took Me to him.

59
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,010
And they he said that: “Yes You have healed
me, this, that give me your healing power”.

60
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,050
I said: “You’ll have to take your Realization”.

61
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,379
He said: “How can I be a Kashyapa?

62
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,879
there were only so many, how can I be a Kashyapa.

63
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,840
I’m not still the-“ I said: “You will
become.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,049
Why don’t you take it?”

65
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,579
But see he was on like this.

66
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,319
He wouldn’t take Realization.

67
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,409
They want to live in ignorance.

68
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:16,049
So, main thing is you first get your Realization;
you get your power within yourself and manifest

69
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,280
it into others.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,350
4:19
But no use putting oil from here to here and

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,780
there to there.

72
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,620
At least let one oil burn; you will have only
stomach trouble.

73
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,150
Otherwise the whole body will collapse, which
was to collapse.

74
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,770
Say the stomach trouble is there, then it’s
it is all right; you can continue with the

75
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,770
stomach trouble.

76
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,720
But, if you remove it from your head there,
then within say 5 days everybody is finished.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,550
Moreover it has a.- it attacks heart, it attacks
heart that’s the main point.

78
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,470
And acupuncture is one thing I’ve seen,
those who take acupuncture are difficult to

79
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,470
get Realization.

80
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,419
Even if they get it, it is difficult to maintain
because of the imbalances created in the body.

81
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,870
We should not create any imbalance ourself.

82
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,400
Already we have created it, at the most if
you have to do anything balance it.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,280
Do not create more imbalances and this is
what is happening with these all things which

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
are done in ignorance.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,780
They do not tell you what you do really, they
never tell you.

86
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,460
Like TM they don’t tell you what it is,
it is nothing but possession.

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,200
They are possessing you absolutely they are
possessing you.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,110
They mesmerize you they don’t tell you we
mesmerize and put a possession on you.

89
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,250
If they tell you won’t pay money to this
fellow.

90
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,130
Isn’t it?

91
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,130
So they won’t tell you.

92
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,000
They say it is transcendental meditation.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
How do you go to trance ask any Indian?

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
he’ll tell you.

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,050
You can only go into trance through mesmerism.

96
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,440
Mesmerism comes through only spirits.

97
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,759
Spirits when they get you, when you get possessed
then only you get into trance.

98
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,130
That’s why they are behaving like this jumping
like this.

99
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,020
Now people are paying for getting convulsions
and epilepsy.

100
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,910
This look at this Verner Leven such an educated
man he writes that if you go to Rajneesh you

101
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,910
get convulsions.

102
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,840
I mean there is even more reason you should
not go.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,420
You pay to get convulsions and to get epilepsy?

104
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,020
First of all you cannot pay; first of all,
if it is real.

105
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,419
Because it is too real to be bought.

106
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,419
All right?

107
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:23,419
First of all.

108
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,759
The first thing is this.

109
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,650
And the second thing is that whatever you
get should transform you completely into a

110
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,650
beautiful person.

111
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:41,639
Your health must improve, your mind must improve,
you should be a fine person, your temperament

112
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,930
must change, your habits must change, your
priorities must change, you should be a person

113
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,520
who is a master of yourself.

114
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:56,500
Instead of going to this man means or to that
guru means you become a worse person.

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,810
That’s what is happening.

116
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,330
How can that be?

117
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,990
And this is not to be achieved through rationality
because rationality is limited.

118
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,140
It’s a state of mind where you jump into
it.

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,300
It’s an actualization; it happens to you.

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Something that is actual should happen to
you.

121
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,889
You cannot just rationalize it sitting down
“Oh I am I’m God, I am Brahma”.

122
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,250
How do you become?

123
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,070
Supposing sitting down here, I say: “I am
Queen Elizabeth”.

124
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,379
They’ll arrest Me and put it in the jail.

125
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,379
[Laughter]
You see my point?

126
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,520
So all these gurus are doing the same thing.

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,330
And now see you are having problems with that.

128
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,520
You can see that sitting and all that you
are getting all these problems are because

129
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
of that.

130
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,970
Now will you please take to something real.

131
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,730
[Shri Mataji laughs]
Lady: What should I take to?

132
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,730
Shri Mataji: You should take to Sahaja Yoga.

133
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,730
All right??

134
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,050
Now give up that Acupuncture for a while,
it’s a horrible stuff.

135
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,000
It’s sinful, I tell you; it spoils Kundalini
of others.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,010
Their chance to realization is diminished.

137
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,960
You would not like to do something like that.

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,900
It’s very wrong, it’s very wrong.

139
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,110
It attacks the base of human beings.

140
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:26,349
Any one of these, any one of them is just
the same.

141
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,330
You can learn Homeopathy.

142
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,330
Homeopathy is better.

143
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,400
Thousand times better than this, if you want
to cure people.

144
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,840
Homeopathy is better it is much more congenial
to human nature.

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,420
You can learn Ayurvedic you can learn any
one of these things.

146
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,530
But, I cannot understand this acupuncture
at all.

147
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,380
Chinese don’t use it in China.

148
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,140
Can you imagine?

149
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,140
In China they don’t.

150
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,180
Lady: They use it in China.

151
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,380
Shri Mataji: No they are telling you lies;
they never do it.

152
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,150
I’ve been to China mainland.

153
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,950
They never do it in China.

154
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,760
All telling you lies.

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,000
They don’t believe in Lao Tse.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,400
They don’t believe in him at all in mainland
China..

157
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,650
They don’t believe in Lao Tse..

158
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,900
Just they don’t have it.

159
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,450
They have other teas and this and that and
they use certain roots a more ayurvedic style

160
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,520
but not acupuncture they don’t have.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,000
I have been in China Myself.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,260
I asked him about it.

163
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,620
They say, “Lao Tse..

164
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,980
useless fellow,” like that.

165
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,030
You see because after LaoTse very few people
got Realization.

166
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,790
And this one has to know what are the centers
in the hand where they are.

167
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,820
They are also using all wrong points all sympathetic
points they are not using the right points

168
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,380
which are the parasympathetic.

169
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,960
But that you need not do with Realization
now why should you do it?

170
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,290
It’s all right.

171
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,510
All right?

172
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,530
It’s a tremendous task.

173
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:15,480
One side so many people are ruined; they are
seekers they have to seek.

174
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,080
And so many people have come round with all
kinds of, you see, ignorant stuff.

175
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,470
It’s absolutely naive, absolutely naive
and dangerous.

176
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:34,550
The other side is, the society is going down;
political people are mad.

177
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:40,200
You, see it’s all sided, if you see the
whole world, I don’t know what’s happening.

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,550
In America people are so mad.

179
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,370
The other day I saw a picture; I don’t know
you saw that BBC thing, it was horrible.

180
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:55,180
I mean, I don’t know, and then one of the
interviewer even asked that this is don’t

181
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,900
you think this is too much you are going too
far with this kind of mass nonsense?

182
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,120
And why should you do it?

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:10,820
Is it not that because of all these sinful
acts the pressure is mounting up in this area

184
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,370
and there will be a big earthquake?

185
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,290
They said we don’t believe in all that.

186
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,500
We have lot of enjoyment and this and that
and they looked horrid.

187
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,080
I mean you could see from their faces that
they were telling lies; there was no enjoyment.

188
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,780
Nothing, you could see sick people, absolutely
sick horrible looking.

189
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,360
All their Agnya catching, Vishuddhi catching,
Mooladhara catching.

190
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,140
What are they happy?

191
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,870
How can they be happy, you see?

192
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,131
They believe in telling lies and believing
in myth and living with it because they think,

193
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:52,600
you see, that is going to help their ego.

194
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,340
We must ask for reality; we must face it;
see it ourselves, accept it and be one with

195
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
it.

196
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,520
That’s just like a warrior.

197
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,070
Otherwise we’ll be cowardly people.

198
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,620
You can see reality clearly you can see.

199
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,300
It’s very easy.

200
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,490
The time has come.

201
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,580
It’s for you people.

202
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,890
You are all seekers of ages; for you only
this is discovered.

203
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,370
All right?

204
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:37,320
How are you now?

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,090
Are you getting the cool breeze?

206
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,330
Lost it?

207
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:55,230
Don’t think about it; if you start thinking,
you loose it.

208
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:04,900
Don’t think about it.

209
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,740
Don’t think.

210
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:41,850
If you think about it, you’ll loose it.

211
00:13:41,850 --> 00:14:15,200
It 

212
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,640
is beyond thought.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:39,890
By thinking you cannot reach there.

214
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,550
All right?

215
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,670
Again it started.

216
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,050
How are you?

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,700
Look after your son.

218
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:57,990
It’s very good, it’s a good point.

219
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,710
Nice you brought it.

220
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:09,120
Shri Mataji: She’s alright now.

221
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,870
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

222
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:33,150
Shri Mataji: You can stay with them or you
stay away.

223
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:40,590
Sahaja Yogi: Alright.

224
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:59,130
I will stay with them up to I go away to France.

225
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,200
Shri Mataji: Ah.

226
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:12,270
Sahaja Yogi: And there I will stay a while
[unsure]

227
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:22,190
Shri Mataji: No but you can stay.

228
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,280
Go back, alright?

229
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:39,730
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you
Shri Mataji: ?

230
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:55,540
will miss you very much.

231
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
So beautiful.

232
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,700
He gave her the present you brought for her.

233
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,590
How is your father?

234
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,890
Sahaja Yogi: Now he’s still misbehaving.

235
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,310
Shri Mataji: ?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

236
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:19,500
Shri Mataji: ….Put every one around
Imagine

237
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:28,360
14: 36 Hindi conversation up to 17:42
Cut in the audio

238
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,720
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Is it on or off?

239
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,250
Sahaja Yogi: It’s on now.

240
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:48,830
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: It’s a very good question.

241
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:57,730
You see when you meditate; how do you meditate
on different chakras?

242
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:12,940
Say you have to meditate on Mooladhara, now
you pay attention towards Mooladhara and take

243
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,670
the name of Shri Ganesha.

244
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,240
Say the mantra.

245
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,680
You know there are four petals; so every – that
mantra should be every time should be four

246
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,309
times should be said.

247
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,430
Four into four you can say.

248
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,960
Pay attention there.

249
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:41,800
Now physically also say we have a Nabhi Chakra
so many of you catch at Nabhi.

250
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:51,510
If you have a liver problem, you can rub a
little sugar on your Nabhi, will be a good

251
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,510
idea.

252
00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:00,540
Or if you have the left hand side problem
of Nabhi if you rub a little oil or ghee or

253
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,240
something it will be a good idea.

254
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,510
And then concentrate on that.

255
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,500
Try to put attention on to that specially
the chakras which are not all right.

256
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,330
You just pay attention to it and meditate
on them.

257
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,990
Pay attention to it is the main point.

258
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:25,260
If you pay attention with the mantras saying,
that’s how you can meditate on every chakra.

259
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,750
And if two people can do it, is a better idea.

260
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,250
Is, you see, in your back, on your back; if
you show the spinal chord, you can see what

261
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,620
chakras are bulging out.

262
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,810
Other person can tell you these are the portions
which are bulging out.

263
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:50,020
So you go on saying the mantras of that chakra
paying attention and the other person can

264
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,730
tell you whether it is all right or not.

265
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,050
For every chakra there is a mantra, which
you know.

266
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:05,370
Apart from mantra, you must know what things
should be used which element should be used

267
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,030
for which chakra.

268
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:15,200
For example, for using say, Mooladhara chakra,
best way to clear out Mooladhara chakra is

269
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,231
sit on the ground.

270
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:18,231
It’s the best way.

271
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:24,330
I’ve told you how to do the exercise to
be able to sit on the ground straight, it’s

272
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:31,680
very good idea of asking the mother earth
to clear out your Mooladhara.

273
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:41,550
For say example, if you have to clear out
say your Nabhi, for Nabhi is made out of the

274
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:50,820
water element and that’s why you have to
ask the water element to help you.

275
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,500
And for Nabhi water element is the best.

276
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,260
If you can use the water element to clear
your Nabhi, it will be a very good idea.

277
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,020
Like that, every chakra is made from some
element as it is.

278
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:14,640
Swadisthana is made of earth and water; so
the sea is the best for Swadhistana.

279
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,680
If you could go to the sea and work out on
Swadhisthana, will be the best for you.

280
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:28,420
In the ocean or you can use salt and water
for Swadhisthana; will be very good.

281
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:37,520
Then we can say that for the heart chakra,
heart chakra is, has to do with the, what

282
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,840
you call, the akash.

283
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:49,780
Firmament, with the firmament, this heart
chakra is with the – ah, no not firmament,

284
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
akash?

285
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,150
Akash “ne”, [no in Hindi].

286
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,430
It’s made out of air [Hindi mika he?]

287
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:02,390
Air is called vayu, vayu is air.

288
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,530
Air or you call it air as an element you call
the word air?

289
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,280
Or firmament?

290
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,470
Firmament is ether, in English isn’t it?

291
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,520
So air, you can say air, air element is for
the heart chakra.

292
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,860
So for that, I have told you how to do, I
mean, breathing.

293
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,250
Breathing is the best way of hold your breath
before the photograph.

294
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,870
Or you can take the breath in, deep breathing
and releasing it for a longer period.

295
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,650
Cleaning it, all these exercises are there.

296
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:47,640
Then you see the mantra is of raksha, is the
protection, to ask for the protection is all

297
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,950
with the air.

298
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,550
All right?

299
00:22:51,550 --> 00:23:32,190
Then we come to this one is here is 
the akash, must be firmament.

300
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,900
What is a firmament in English?

301
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,380
Ether?

302
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Firmament is ether?

303
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,530
All right, so this is the firmament, you see,
I read one translation but I was not sure.

304
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,770
This is the akash, is the sky.

305
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,960
This is the sky, here, all right?

306
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:02,540
This is made out of the sky firmament and
this is made out of the light.

307
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,780
Firmament is sky, is it?

308
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:15,750
So this is sky; that’s why it is Virata
this thing.

309
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,590
And this is your light.

310
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,720
So for Agnya chakra you have to use the light,
for this you have to use the sky.

311
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,330
If your hands put up like this if you say
“Allah hu Akbar” put both the hands towards

312
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,590
the sky.

313
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,590
See like that.

314
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,190
There are so many ways of using the sky, watching
the sky, looking at the sky.

315
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,800
And for this the sun and the light is to be
used.

316
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,450
Now supposing you are suffering from say left
side problem, is sort of you’re possessed

317
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,860
or something, then you can use the sun you
see because the sun will give you balance.

318
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,420
But if you have the right side problems, like
ego and all that you should use the moon,

319
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,550
put the left hand towards the moon.

320
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,330
But always people do the other way round say
these dramatic melodramatic people you see,

321
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,750
all of them will go to the lunar side in them,
they like the moonlight.

322
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,120
And those who are egoistical will go in the
sun and burn themselves off.

323
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,860
So other way round it should be.

324
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,800
Like that if you use, you can work it out.

325
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,160
All right?

326
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,710
You yourself can manage it.

327
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:32,390
So these are different centers, which must
be cleansed and meditated onto and or to be

328
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,060
dissolved into their own.

329
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:41,620
I mean if you dissolve them into their own
element, then you get more strength you see

330
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,170
into that particular body.

331
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,570
It’s like that.

332
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:57,060
Sahaja Yogi: Can you tell us a bit about sunset;
are we not to look at the sunset?

333
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,470
Shri Mataji: A Sunset is not very good, sunrise,
sunset is not good.

334
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,140
That’s the time the sun is taking away all
the energies from this earth.

335
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,000
So it’s not such a good time to see.

336
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,880
It depends on for example ego-oriented people
if they see sun would be better off.

337
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,960
Little bit of their ego might go down.

338
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:32,650
But people who have got a left-side problem
should see the sun rise, will be good.

339
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,690
It’s only the other way round.

340
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,170
You see now?

341
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,170
Good question.

342
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,130
Now any other question?

343
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,600
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

344
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,750
Can you tell me when Kundalini rises, can
we see the Kundalini in each chakra?…

345
00:26:47,750 --> 00:27:00,670
I mean it could rise to repair [unsure] a
chakra at once?

346
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:10,780
Shri Mataji: Actually normally if your instrument
is perfect you don’t feel it anywhere.

347
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,370
It just comes through and you just feel the
cool breeze from your head and you can feel

348
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:24,120
the Kundalinis, what you call the fountain,
coming out as cool breeze.

349
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,600
But if your chakras are closed or there’s
some problem or they are defective or sick

350
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,490
or anything is there, then the Kundalini goes
there and hits it.

351
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:40,059
Like specially Void, if you have a Void, this
thing you can see it clearly at the back of

352
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:45,510
a person; if the Void is caught up, you can
see that at the end of the Void here; it will

353
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,690
go on pushing like that.

354
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:58,630
And if the Sushumna, the central path is absolutely
clear cut, a person is absolutely in the center,

355
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,690
then the Kundalini just goes like that straight.

356
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,670
And they also never have any problem later.

357
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,690
Sahaja Yogini: What about the heat in our
chakras?

358
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,690
Shri Mataji: Heat?

359
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,460
Heat comes in if you have a liver problem
or a right side problem.

360
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,590
In the right side is too much of heat; in
the left side it is too much of cold.

361
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,110
Some people feel very cold and they perspire
and this and that.

362
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:27,890
If you have the left side problem then you
get perspiration, specially with the heart.

363
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:34,470
Or some people have very low low blood pressure
or who have left side problem, can feel very

364
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,710
cold also.

365
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:43,020
The heat comes because of liver mainly; those
who have too much of sun in them, the heat

366
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,679
starts coming.

367
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,640
Also heat is a sign of over-activity in a
person, a person is overactive.

368
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,740
Cancer gives too much heat I have seen.

369
00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:00,120
Cancer also gives too much heat, gives so
much heat that one cancer patient can really

370
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,740
make the whole house heated up.

371
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,179
[Laughter]
You don’t need any heater with a cancer

372
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,720
patient if you know how to raise the Kundalini.

373
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,700
And the left side is.

374
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,850
[Laughter.

375
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:19,190
Shri Mataji laughs] It’s a common experience.

376
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,790
It’s very interesting you know; Sahaja Yoga
is very interesting.

377
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,950
Even cancer makes you laugh, the way the things
are.

378
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,610
But surprisingly, you’ll be amazed that
I have not come across one cancer patient

379
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,510
so far who is just right sided.

380
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,410
Always he ends up in the left.

381
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:45,330
Means he must have had some sort of a problem
with a black magic or some bad guru, or some

382
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,790
sort of a thing which is unauthorized against
God; something like that.

383
00:29:50,790 --> 00:30:00,000
Cancer is always, I have seen it always, leukemia,
treated cancer of the, what you call peritoneum,

384
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,240
cancer of kidneys, cancer of lungs; all of
them had this.

385
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,910
That means somewhere a guru or somebody or
some black magic or spiritualist or something

386
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:18,740
like that, he has intervened with the personality,
and then you get this cancer business.

387
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,840
It’s a remarkable thing.

388
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,830
Sahaja Yogini: Does the heat always indicate
a cancer problem?

389
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,590
Shri Mataji: Cancer?

390
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,929
No no no no.

391
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:38,420
No no no no no no.

392
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,660
Heat indicates liver, mainly liver.

393
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,360
All right?

394
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,740
And cancer is also; it’s when the cells
become ego-oriented, you see, a person who

395
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,300
is ego oriented, they think too much, they
work very hard, means they get liver.

396
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
You see?

397
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:07,110
Because one center has to do the liver, the
pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys and uterus.

398
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,110
Imagine.

399
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,450
And the same has to make -look after the cells
for the brain, the same center, Swadisthana.

400
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,210
When it has to work both the things, naturally,
if you start thinking too much, then what

401
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,220
happens?

402
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,090
That these are neglected.

403
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,770
So you develop liver, you develop kidney;
you develop diabetes, you develop uterus troubles.

404
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,770
You see?

405
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,840
All these things can happen.

406
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,559
Apart from that, it goes further; by that
time, when you do it, overdo it, then your

407
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:43,910
left side starts freezing
[Cut in the audio]

408
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,440
Ego orientation of any society will give you
more heart attacks.

409
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,540
But when ego develops too much in a society,
people start seeing it; then they get frightened

410
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,799
of the ego, then they must drink, because,
just to run away from the ego that they can’t

411
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,799
bear to see themselves that egoistical.

412
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,799
So they drink, they take to drugs, these things
to run away because they can’t just bear

413
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,870
the ego of people.

414
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:11,220
They find they are really silly idiots you
see going around.

415
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,049
So they don’t want to be like them; so they
take the other side.

416
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,790
When they go to the other side they go to
the left side.

417
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,370
Now when going to the left side both things
being sort of very much fought up, there’s

418
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,470
a wobbling going on in your brain; with that
you develop all these problems.

419
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:37,110
But if you are only left sided you may be
absolutely reading only Lord Byron and you

420
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,940
can land up in lunatic asylum.

421
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,720
You can, I’ve seen one like that.

422
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,210
Only reading Lord Byron could be possible
because he just makes you miserable.

423
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:51,170
He, himself, was a very funny man but he wants
everybody to be miserable.

424
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:57,940
You see and he always sings songs of such
cry, I mean such a man I don’t know how

425
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,790
he developed this kind of a melodramatic stuff.

426
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:06,450
But I’ve known people who came to Me who
have been just crying reading this Lord Byron.

427
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:13,030
He himself enjoyed life very well.

428
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:20,510
So one has to take a very, very wise and sane
attitude towards life.

429
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:30,970
That you are the eternal life, that you are
the eternal being and you have come on this

430
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:36,450
earth to enjoy all the blessings that God
has created and not for weeping and crying

431
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,450
and feeling guilty.

432
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,470
That’s not your job.

433
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,470
First thing is that.

434
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,470
This is wisdom.

435
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:47,080
And you are not going to make miserable about
small, small things of life also.

436
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,280
Like the other day I saw a very interesting
story of a husband wife quarreling ending

437
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,840
up into a divorce and poor husband had no
house, you see.

438
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,620
So he went to his brother’s place.

439
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,860
The brother’s wife very particular about
everything; she had three pets.

440
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,330
So he could not put the box anywhere because
she would say.

441
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,740
“No no no no no!

442
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,149
There is another pet here!”

443
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,130
Again, poor thing would lift it up.

444
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,830
Then, “No no no no no!

445
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:15,830
Not there!

446
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,990
There is another pet; then another there like
that you see.

447
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:24,530
All the time worried about small, small petty
things of life.

448
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,050
Also that can create a problem of ego orientation.

449
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,190
Live in a very carefree manner.

450
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:37,409
It’s not so important but that doesn’t
mean laziness.

451
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,340
I must tell you that doesn’t mean la – zi
–ness.

452
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,419
Spell it with capital letters, all of you.

453
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:58,290
By any chance it doesn’t mean that; it means
hard work – but enjoy it and not to be involved

454
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:05,820
into things, which are of no importance at
all, useless things.

455
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,400
Here it is joy spread for you.

456
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,820
Why are you bothered about these things?

457
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,869
They’re not meant for you.

458
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,690
Isn’t it?

459
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:35,690
Ah ha I – David, you see, thank God you
told Me about it because I found, I remembered,

460
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,109
that the Secretary of our Health Ministry
in Delhi, himself, came to see Me.

461
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:45,771
He was there for three hours because our President
has told him that Mataji has cured him and

462
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,230
he’s very anxious to verify it.

463
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:56,950
That saying particular sounds, say for the
Vishuddhi, like there are sixteen: uh, ah,

464
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:05,080
e, ee, u, oo lu, glu, gloo, loo, a, I, o ,ou,
, um ahum – sixteen.

465
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,140
Now all these sixteen sounds are for sixteen
petals, but you need not do all that.

466
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,070
If you just say the innermost thing is Virat.

467
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,930
There is no need to have the sounds or anything.

468
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:25,920
Just you say “Virat” and it opens out.

469
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:39,950
No use knowing, unnecessary, because we have
gone to the center most part, you see, called

470
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,330
as the Brahma nadi.

471
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:49,160
You see, if you have to go, say, from the
leaf to the root, then you have to know all

472
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
the way.

473
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,910
But if you are coming from the root, inside
the root, then what is the need?

474
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:05,570
When they move that way, then only they knew
all these things.

475
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:14,720
Say, in this house or in any building, you
have a lift just in the center, you see, and

476
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
moving upward.

477
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,040
You don’t have to know.

478
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,710
You just move.

479
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:24,680
But, if you have to come from outside every
time, every chakra, you will never be able

480
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,740
to enter inside the lift.

481
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:33,859
But you’ll be doing all; you will know everything
about that particular chakra from outside.

482
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:39,430
But you’ll never get in; it is all the sympathetic
movement.

483
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:45,640
So there is no need to know; like this I was
telling you, this is the center and this is

484
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,440
the left and this is the right.

485
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,750
You can come from the left and go back to
the left or you come from the left and go

486
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,750
to the right.

487
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,250
But, you cannot get inside and this inside
getting is the point.

488
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:01,240
That’s the way you do it.

489
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
All right?
