1
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:36,520
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

2
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,060
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havana.

3
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:55,360
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

4
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,580
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

5
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:14,140
You know that He resides within us.

6
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:44,350
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

7
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,750
excite His powers.

8
00:02:49,750 --> 00:03:13,190
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

9
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:49,360
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

10
00:03:49,360 --> 00:04:06,099
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

11
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:18,470
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

12
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,180
attention to it with absolute purity.

13
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:41,300
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

14
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:51,150
Shri Ganesha.

15
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,060
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

16
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:08,590
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

17
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:22,840
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

18
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:50,350
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

19
00:05:50,350 --> 00:06:05,070
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

20
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:38,900
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

21
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:51,120
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

22
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,169
So, in action you do like that.

23
00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:06,389
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

24
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,620
been created.

25
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:17,310
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

26
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,680
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

27
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:37,810
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

28
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:44,580
appreciation of creativity.

29
00:07:44,580 --> 00:08:01,979
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

30
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,660
so that your ego is controlled.

31
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:18,870
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

32
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,199
Your Mother is a good example.

33
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:39,930
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

34
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,370
that I am so knowledgeable.

35
00:08:45,370 --> 00:09:01,380
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

36
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,270
that gives you a shock.

37
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:18,791
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

38
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:33,480
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

39
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:45,620
But you must deal with it beautifully.

40
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,790
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

41
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:59,490
That is the central point, that is the result.

42
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:10,170
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

43
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:19,130
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

44
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:43,399
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

45
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,769
effect.

46
00:10:46,769 --> 00:11:00,399
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

47
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,970
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

48
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,910
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

49
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,730
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

50
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:35,700
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

51
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,029
to call him Napoleon.

52
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:49,860
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

53
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,570
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

54
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:04,730
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

55
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,029
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

56
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:12,060
There is no love in fanaticism.

57
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:23,360
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

58
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,332
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

59
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:35,840
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

60
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:53,550
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

61
00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:06,940
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

62
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:14,440
and not a tense, abrupt person.

63
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:30,120
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

64
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,600
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

65
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,149
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

66
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:49,010
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

67
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,269
Innocence is the wisest thing.

68
00:13:54,269 --> 00:14:00,339
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

69
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:07,431
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

70
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:18,940
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

71
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:33,670
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

72
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:51,550
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

73
00:14:51,550 --> 00:15:00,560
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

74
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,420
It gives you concentration.

75
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:17,300
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

76
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,269
Sucking everything!

77
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:41,670
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

78
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:54,550
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

79
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:05,020
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

80
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:12,209
to what he is to do next.

81
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:17,829
So innocence keeps you in the present.

82
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,660
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

83
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,820
Supposing I have to go today.

84
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:35,329
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

85
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,770
about it?

86
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,600
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

87
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:54,230
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

88
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:01,620
Because they are not in the present.

89
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,120
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

90
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,720
At the most what’s going to happen?

91
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:21,159
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

92
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,399
So why worry?

93
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:31,179
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

94
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:49,940
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

95
00:17:49,940 --> 00:18:01,799
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

96
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:09,750
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

97
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:24,559
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

98
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:37,720
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

99
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:47,440
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

100
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,109
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

101
00:18:54,109 --> 00:19:08,509
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

102
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:15,289
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

103
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:21,929
What can I fear anymore?

104
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:33,630
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

105
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:50,049
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

106
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:56,649
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

107
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:05,169
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

108
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:13,290
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

109
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:22,409
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

110
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:38,359
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

111
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,359
… “.

112
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:51,070
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

113
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
this … “.

114
00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:04,999
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

115
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:20,489
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

116
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:30,029
It sees the play.

117
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,879
Just sees.

118
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:39,749
It enjoys the play.

119
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,970
Just enjoys.

120
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:58,029
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

121
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:02,529
power of innocence be enlightened”.

122
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:17,529
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

123
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:22,479
The source of emotional security.

124
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:34,174
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

125
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:55,463
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

126
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,752
A motherly enchantment.

127
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,080
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

128
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:25,269
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

129
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:36,210
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

130
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,139
But some people confuse it.

131
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:50,989
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

132
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:55,840
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

133
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,509
“Motha Bal”.

134
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:10,529
And there’s no end to it.

135
00:24:10,529 --> 00:24:27,150
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

136
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,289
no time.

137
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:38,119
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

138
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:49,263
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

139
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:52,429
He is the eldest of all.

140
00:24:52,429 --> 00:25:03,249
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

141
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:16,429
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

142
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:27,879
doesn’t like it much.

143
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:36,729
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

144
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:47,999
But it does not go to his head or anything.

145
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:54,250
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

146
00:25:54,250 --> 00:26:04,989
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

147
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:16,489
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

148
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:23,119
Feet, because I have known that art”.

149
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:30,700
I said alright, come such and such day.

150
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:39,710
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

151
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,720
It is me who is relaxing”.

152
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:53,429
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

153
00:26:53,429 --> 00:27:10,450
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

154
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,450
It relaxes.

155
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,159
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

156
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:28,539
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

157
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:39,460
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

158
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:47,179
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

159
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,339
who does that.

160
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:57,460
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

161
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,789
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

162
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:16,339
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

163
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:43,389
person needs it.

164
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:54,330
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

165
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,820
It is ‘you’ who need it.

166
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,999
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

167
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:18,330
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

168
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:26,249
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

169
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:28,359
it that way.

170
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:34,509
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

171
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:42,679
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

172
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:53,309
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

173
00:29:53,309 --> 00:30:03,049
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

174
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:11,720
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

175
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:23,489
where Ganesha is pleased.

176
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:29,259
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

177
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:34,839
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

178
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:43,279
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

179
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:59,529
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

180
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:03,029
all His powers.

181
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:13,229
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

182
00:31:13,229 --> 00:31:22,609
Both the types of powers must be developed.

183
00:31:22,609 --> 00:31:29,639
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

184
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:49,330
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

185
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,410
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

186
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:01,539
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

187
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:22,830
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

188
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:41,879
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

189
00:32:41,879 --> 00:33:01,419
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

190
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:27,639
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

191
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:36,700
It is very natural.

192
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:54,149
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

193
00:33:54,149 --> 00:34:00,989
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

194
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,549
than to their wives.

195
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,940
Funny thing.

196
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,759
It is absurd.

197
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,750
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

198
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,530
it is not good.

199
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,919
It’s again perversion.

200
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:31,060
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

201
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,850
It is absurd.

202
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,640
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

203
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:47,710
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

204
00:34:47,710 --> 00:35:03,150
There has to be very healthy relationship.

205
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:14,160
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

206
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,069
So nothing absurd should be done.

207
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,339
No thing overly should be done.

208
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:31,460
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

209
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:40,390
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

210
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,060
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

211
00:35:45,060 --> 00:36:01,170
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

212
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,170
of Mr.

213
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:13,299
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

214
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:19,150
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

215
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,400
Or we may be jealous.

216
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,329
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

217
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:32,400
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

218
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:44,789
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

219
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,250
like him.

220
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,329
I am talking of wisdom.

221
00:36:52,329 --> 00:37:04,069
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

222
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:18,590
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

223
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,790
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

224
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,609
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

225
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:37,829
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

226
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:54,190
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

227
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:06,900
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

228
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,600
So it is quite funny.

229
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:27,000
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

230
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:35,780
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

231
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:46,769
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

232
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:54,440
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

233
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,869
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

234
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:07,260
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

235
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,670
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

236
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:19,270
I was just trying to put it right.

237
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:27,490
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

238
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,049
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

239
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:32,049
Meat out.

240
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:45,990
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

241
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:56,550
So there should be maryadas.

242
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:10,609
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

243
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:22,670
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

244
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:34,109
this person or that person -I know it is.

245
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:36,390
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

246
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,390
that is good.

247
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:44,700
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

248
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:58,750
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

249
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:04,859
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

250
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:16,079
So, now I can be very bad.

251
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,109
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

252
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:21,109
it was all right.

253
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:28,480
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

254
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,500
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

255
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,259
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

256
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:43,539
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

257
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:47,140
Just like that.

258
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:53,500
To use it as a power.

259
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,039
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

260
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:04,420
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

261
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:16,460
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

262
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,619
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

263
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:22,830
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

264
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,910
Now, what is the wisdom?

265
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,940
Where is it lost?

266
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,960
It is ridiculous.

267
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:38,010
So, one has to be wise.

268
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:44,660
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

269
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:55,810
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

270
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:02,230
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

271
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:07,130
in one lecture.

272
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:16,930
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

273
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,740
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

274
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,180
is all; he is not bothered.

275
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:35,319
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

276
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:48,230
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

277
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:55,190
with your innocence.

278
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:04,690
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

279
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:13,220
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

280
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,619
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

281
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:26,650
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

282
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:38,720
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

283
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:56,140
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

284
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,740
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

285
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:07,930
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

286
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:16,170
Not to see anything that is tempting.

287
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:21,869
So put your eyes on the ground.

288
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:35,779
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

289
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:41,609
with lust.

290
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:56,039
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

291
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:03,559
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

292
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:14,880
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

293
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:23,829
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

294
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:39,180
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.
