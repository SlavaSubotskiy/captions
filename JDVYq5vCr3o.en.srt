1
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:14,726
All these years

2
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:24,645
I have been waiting for this day.

3
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:37,926
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

4
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:49,559
so is a very important turning point

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:01:03,478
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

6
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,968
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

7
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:17,089
And so now is a new change has to come

8
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,427
and you can see the announcement.

9
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:40,795
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

10
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:50,210
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

11
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:55,359
We are collectively conscious.

12
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:07,180
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

13
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:15,714
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

14
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:24,484
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

15
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:35,522
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

16
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:41,886
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

17
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:48,655
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

18
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:07,412
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

19
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:11,420
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

20
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:17,893
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

21
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:31,774
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

22
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,404
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

23
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:42,410
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

24
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:48,539
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

25
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,931
All the time they are helping you.

26
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:55,000
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

27
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,291
they are using them at the right time.

28
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:08,094
 Now be confident that you have powers.

29
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:20,106
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

30
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:25,034
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

31
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:30,929
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

32
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:40,449
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

33
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:48,146
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

34
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:52,745
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

35
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:57,639
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

36
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,312
and the new character is announcement.

37
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:08,812
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

38
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:14,779
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

39
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:18,298
Now you have to all start talking about it,

40
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:22,063
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

41
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:28,182
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

42
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:35,886
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

43
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:39,912
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

44
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:45,118
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

45
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,414
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

46
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:54,370
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

47
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:58,500
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

48
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:05,212
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

49
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:11,628
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

50
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:18,489
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

51
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:23,983
and very different type of people.

52
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:31,252
Now that assumption has to be there.

53
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:38,901
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

54
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:44,536
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

55
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:50,750
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

56
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:54,342
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

57
00:06:54,542 --> 00:07:01,673
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

58
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,147
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

59
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:12,910
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

60
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:18,177
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

61
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:32,698
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

62
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,993
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

63
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:38,091
now leave them in the water.”

64
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,487
His attention was here and there,

65
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:43,670
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

66
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,300
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

67
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,891
and lasted for five days more after that.

68
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,422
Then he was convinced.

69
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:05,120
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

70
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:09,514
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

71
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:13,368
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

72
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,667
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

73
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:23,124
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

74
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:29,100
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

75
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:34,279
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

76
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:41,886
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

77
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,834
for your countries and for the whole world.

78
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:50,461
Now, assume your powers.

79
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:56,568
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

80
00:08:56,798 --> 00:09:01,450
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

81
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:08,048
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

82
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:13,409
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

83
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,820
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

84
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:20,984
Now you have to count your powers:

85
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,616
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

86
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:30,515
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

87
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:35,903
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

88
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,806
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

89
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:42,851
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

90
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:46,571
and how you are going to work out.

91
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:54,356
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

92
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:59,950
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

93
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:04,238
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

94
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:09,470
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

95
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,701
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

96
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:16,872
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

97
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:20,518
that I have put many a times before
you people,

98
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:23,565
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

99
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,361
Now don’t have diffidence.

100
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:31,236
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

101
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:35,646
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

102
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,195
This work is not going to be done
by special people

103
00:10:38,395 --> 00:10:42,146
because they are suffering from ego.

104
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:45,911
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

105
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:52,825
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

106
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:57,147
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

107
00:10:57,348 --> 00:11:01,753
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

108
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:13,312
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

109
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:17,080
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

110
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,858
any animal you could think of.

111
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,732
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

112
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:32,875
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

113
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:39,819
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

114
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,111
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

115
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,064
So many letters of confessions come to me,

116
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:52,178
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

117
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,682
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

118
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,933
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

119
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:03,295
I am a Maha Yogi.”

120
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,242
This is the confession you have to make.

121
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:11,499
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

122
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,458
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

123
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,042
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

124
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:24,181
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

125
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:29,657
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

126
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:36,861
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

127
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:46,803
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

128
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:50,090
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

129
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,316
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

130
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:56,102
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

131
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:58,379
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

132
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,197
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

133
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:05,263
running after something that is a mirage

134
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:09,585
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

135
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:12,494
We have to openly say it, this thing.

136
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,379
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

137
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,169
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

138
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,155
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

139
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:26,152
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

140
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:31,731
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

141
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,644
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

142
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,889
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

143
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,836
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

144
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:52,845
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

145
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:56,154
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

146
00:13:56,355 --> 00:14:00,856
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

147
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:05,368
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

148
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:11,204
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

149
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:16,361
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

150
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:22,552
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

151
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:25,644
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

152
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:31,618
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,604
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

154
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:39,347
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

155
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:44,304
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

156
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:47,860
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

157
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,835
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

158
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:55,216
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

159
00:14:55,417 --> 00:15:00,926
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

160
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:07,195
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

161
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:13,033
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

162
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:17,789
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

163
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,945
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

164
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:28,414
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

165
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:33,716
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

166
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:38,216
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

167
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,636
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

168
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,855
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

169
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,509
for every small little nonsensical things.

170
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,727
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

171
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,950
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

172
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,499
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

173
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,070
they are not going to come out.”

174
00:15:56,271 --> 00:16:01,647
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

175
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,923
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

176
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:08,009
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

177
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,292
You are not entangled with anyone.

178
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:13,303
You are not any way attached to anyone.

179
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:17,250
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

180
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,674
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

181
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,648
your country and ultimately the world.

182
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:31,996
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

183
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:35,341
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

184
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,676
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

185
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,596
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

186
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:47,225
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

187
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:52,748
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

188
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,244
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

189
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:58,415
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

190
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,917
But there is all knowledge within you.

191
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:05,380
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

192
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,513
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

193
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,464
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

194
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,835
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

195
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,309
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

196
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:26,374
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

197
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:30,628
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

198
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,189
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

199
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,646
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

200
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,648
But these are very, very mundane things

201
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:44,099
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

202
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,806
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

203
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:51,272
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

204
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:53,828
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

205
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,300
whether you are a child or a grown up.

206
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:01,515
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

207
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:06,428
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

208
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:09,507
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

209
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,423
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

210
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:16,082
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

211
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:21,010
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

212
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:24,351
is a commitment and complete involvement.

213
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:28,030
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

214
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:30,912
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

215
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:34,418
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

216
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,388
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

217
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,497
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

218
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,991
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

219
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:48,291
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

220
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,650
The whole attention should be on that.

221
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:56,475
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

222
00:18:56,676 --> 00:19:01,479
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

223
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,323
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

224
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:10,394
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

225
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:13,700
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

226
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:17,560
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

227
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:23,169
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

228
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,165
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

229
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:31,099
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

230
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,749
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

231
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,946
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

232
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:41,652
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

233
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:45,137
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

234
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:49,952
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

235
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:58,946
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

236
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:03,094
because attention which was involved
into negative things

237
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:08,591
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:13,016
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

239
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:16,187
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

240
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,767
then we should think that you are still
backdated

241
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:25,905
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

242
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:30,478
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

243
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:37,501
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

244
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:42,447
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

245
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:47,783
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

246
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:55,514
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

247
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:58,281
You just experiment and see for yourself.

248
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,133
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

249
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,192
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

250
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:07,799
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

251
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,994
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

252
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:15,279
Now those days are gone!

253
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,278
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

254
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:25,977
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

255
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:37,503
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

256
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:40,514
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:43,827
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

258
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,371
You can eat the way you want to eat.

259
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:51,599
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

260
00:21:51,800 --> 00:22:00,670
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

261
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:04,530
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

262
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:09,467
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

263
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:12,945
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

264
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:17,641
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

265
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:24,083
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

266
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:27,713
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

267
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:31,861
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

268
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:36,342
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

269
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:38,793
and we have to work it out that way.

270
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:41,777
Today we have here people from all over
the world

271
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:45,098
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

272
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,236
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

273
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:54,517
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

274
00:22:54,718 --> 00:23:02,219
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

275
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:06,459
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

276
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,638
May God bless you all.

277
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,996
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

278
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:27,642
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

279
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,260
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

280
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,766
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

281
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:39,057
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

282
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:43,436
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

283
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:47,897
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

284
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:53,681
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

285
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:59,081
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

286
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:06,609
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

287
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:13,126
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

288
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:19,615
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

289
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,436
But only thing what you need is a courage

290
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:30,558
and a complete commitment to go forward

291
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:37,994
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
