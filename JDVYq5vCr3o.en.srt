1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,542
All these years, I have been waiting, for this day.

2
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:35,709
We have now, on the 21st Sahasrara,

3
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:50,667
so is a very important, turning point as you know that

4
00:00:50,709 --> 00:01:04,291
every 21st day we change our calendars as far as the

5
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:13,792
horoscope is concerned. And so now, is a new change

6
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:19,542
has to come. And you can see the announcement.

7
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:34,208
A new understanding, an awareness,

8
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:44,291
of a very new dimension. We have been so far dealing

9
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:48,291
with collective consciousness.

10
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:53,500
We are collectively conscious.

11
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:04,375
We have, the idea that we are collectively conscious.

12
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:13,000
Also we know we are part and parcel of the whole.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,166
And that, we all are Sahaja Yogis.

14
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:32,999
We know about our chakras and our, nadis very clearly.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,375
But perhaps we do not know about our powers.

16
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:44,999
How many powers have developed in those twenty-one

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:01,917
years within yourself?. Last two months,

18
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,583
Italy was burning with fire, it was so very hot.

19
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:10,500
And I read reports that they are worried about

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,375
a drought and they want rain to come in and now

21
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:17,083
they think the time has passed away.

22
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:29,917
But how it works you see because, the All-pervading Power knows everything

23
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,333
and the whole nature works for your benefit,

24
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:39,208
for your programs. At the right time

25
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,000
things happen as you have seen before.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,667
They're completely coordinated, with our programs.

27
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,959
All the time they are helping you.

28
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,999
Whatever they have in them, serves as powers.

29
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,250
They are using them at the right time.

30
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:07,208
Now be confident, that you have powers

31
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,834
and this is the new change that is going to come,

32
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:21,417
within your, own understanding. So far only you know

33
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,875
that you could feel the vibrations.

34
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:30,917
That you could cure people. You could help to cure,

35
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,959
I mean still not so confident.

36
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,417
That, you could feel the Paramchaitanya.

37
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:45,166
But you did not know what dynamic forces

38
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,083
are working in you now

39
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,500
and this is a new change that is going to come.

40
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:54,959
With this new change you have to assume

41
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,083
a new character. And the new character is announcement.

42
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,875
So far I have told you not to talk about Sahaja Yoga

43
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:10,500
very openly, blatantly. But now the time has come.

44
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,041
We waited long, for these days.

45
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,041
Now you have to all start, talking about it,

46
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,917
announcing about it and telling about it to everyone.

47
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:26,000
Otherwise the world would say that we never knew about it.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,750
All other false gurus are so well known all over

49
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,959
because their disciples are talking about them

50
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,834
all the places wherever they can,

51
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:44,834
to all the, big offices they go, to big people they go.

52
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,000
They go to all the important people,

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,792
just go and tell them what they have.

54
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,041
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga

55
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,125
at a low ebb because I wanted you,

56
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,709
first of all to develop into really,

57
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,041
very, beautiful Sahaja Yogis so that from your life,

58
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:08,667
from your life style, from your behaviour,

59
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,500
from your understanding, from your thoughts,

60
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,041
people will realise that these people are very unique,

61
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:27,458
and very different type of people. Now that, assumption,

62
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:33,542
has to be there. You have to understand,

63
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,000
that all these powers are bubbling in you,

64
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:43,583
and just out of formality or maybe out of shyness,

65
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:48,625
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding them.

66
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,500
The other day there was a Sahaja Yogi who came

67
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,709
to My house and he saw some flowers

68
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,875
which were fading away. I said,

69
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,083
"They are not fading. You can give them life.

70
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,250
" He said, "How?" I said, "You cut the bottom off

71
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:11,166
all of them and put your hand underneath."

72
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:30,834
And he just put his hands under the base of the stem

73
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:34,208
and he said, "Mother they're still drooping."

74
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,792
I said, "Alright, now leave them in the water."

75
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:40,291
His attention was here and there, within fifteen days

76
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,750
they all stood up. Alright. Roots started growing,

77
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,834
they became bigger flowers and lasted

78
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:52,999
for five days more after that. Then he was convinced.

79
00:07:52,999 --> 00:08:02,333
You can do so many things, to convince yourself

80
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,709
that you have these powers. I have seen people

81
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,125
who have certain problems. They have a headache.

82
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:14,041
They have this, that they come to Me. Write big letters,

83
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,417
"Mother I get my headache. I can't get rid of it.

84
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,750
" Now those days are gone where Mother has to cure

85
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,583
your headache, look after your wife,

86
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,000
look after your children. Is all finished now.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,375
Now you are responsible, not only for yourself,

88
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:40,000
but, for your ashrams, for your cities,

89
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,625
for your countries and for the whole world.

90
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:52,583
Now assume your powers. Like yesterday he sang this,

91
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:57,166
or he played the "Royal Court". So now you are

92
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,375
in the Royal Court. Take up your responsibilities.

93
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:05,125
Everybody has to feel responsible and assume,

94
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:10,291
what you are. Know your powers. What you can do.

95
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:15,000
Sit down. Now the days are gone when you had

96
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,875
to sit down and count your blessings. Now you have

97
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:23,333
to count your powers. How many powers I have and

98
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,333
what I can use and how I can use it.

99
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,625
No use counting your miracles.

100
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,500
You have had enough miracles to prove

101
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,083
that you are Sahaja Yogis and that you are helped

102
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,417
by the Paramchaitanya. But now know how much

103
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,500
of that Paramchaitanya you are going to use yourself,

104
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,625
how you are going to maneuver it and how you are going to work out.

105
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:52,667
This is the new era, we are starting from today.

106
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:56,041
And this is the day I was waiting

107
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,834
for all of you, to realize,

108
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,834
that you are not Sahaja Yogis for only your selfish ends,

109
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:08,750
nor for your families, nor for your communities,

110
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,458
nor for your country, but for the whole world.

111
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,125
Expand yourself. You must have that vision before you,

112
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:20,375
that I have put many-a-times before you people

113
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,291
that you have to emancipate the humanity.

114
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,999
Now don't have diffidence. First of all

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,041
you should not think that, "We are very ordinary people.

116
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:35,041
We are very ordinary. We haven't got something special about."

117
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,041
This work is not going to be done by special people

118
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,917
because they are suffering from ego. It is going to be done

119
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,667
by people who don't have that ego, of great success,

120
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:52,208
or of great achievements or riches or anything.

121
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,000
If they are rid of this then only they can work it out.

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,041
And that's why it is for you to understand what Christ has said

123
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:07,959
that a camel can pass through the hole

124
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:13,834
of a needle but not a rich man. Because the ego

125
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,667
is too big, bigger than a camel,

126
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,583
bigger than an elephant, any animal

127
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:21,542
you could think of. That's why now,

128
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,542
as we are entering into new awareness,

129
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:30,333
let us not worry about our negative thinking.

130
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:37,041
So first is the diffidence, "How can I be?

131
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,500
I am not alright. I was like this.

132
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,041
I was doing like this. I had done like this."

133
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,250
So many letters of confessions come to Me,

134
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,875
pages after pages which I throw away or burn them off.

135
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:53,792
There is no need to confess anymore.

136
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,500
There's only one confession that, "I am a Sahaja Yogi

137
00:11:56,542 --> 00:12:01,125
and now, after 21st of Sahasrara, I am a Mahayogi."

138
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:06,375
This is the confession you have to make

139
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,125
and no more of all these out of date things

140
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,875
that people tell Me about your family's life,

141
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:16,417
all mundane nonsensical things. We have given them up

142
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,834
and we have come to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

143
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:22,542
We have achieved our ascent and now for what? For what?

144
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,917
Have achieved our ascent is, to emancipate

145
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,500
human beings, to help them out

146
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,083
of the mire of ignorance, of darkness.

147
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:41,875
The main target I feel today should not be

148
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:45,083
so much political as fundamentalism.

149
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,792
So we have to openly say

150
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,166
to these fundamentalists that, "You are nonsensical.

151
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,750
You don't know the truth. You don't know anything about truth.

152
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,625
You don't know that you are the spirit.

153
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,208
You don't know that there is a power that is working."

154
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,750
You have to tell them very clearly, "You are all

155
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:04,750
stupid people running after something that is a mirage

156
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,999
and all of you will end up into hell

157
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,250
as described by all the scriptures."

158
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,375
We have to openly say it, these things,

159
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,208
which ever way you like. You may write books.

160
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,792
You may publish it. You may tell people about it.

161
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:20,125
But now the new announcement has to come, to say that,

162
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,667
"Running after falsehood is not going to take you to God."

163
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:31,000
And, in that they have used the power of hatred.

164
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,125
So you have to say that, "We believe in the power of love

165
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,542
and not in the power of hatred that you believe in."

166
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,875
For us everybody is capable of finding

167
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:48,667
the truth and is capable of getting to the, heaven

168
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:53,750
of that paradise which is promised to us,

169
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,583
the kingdom of God. So for us, everybody,

170
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,792
whether they belong to this community,

171
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:03,125
that community, this race or that race, whatever it is,

172
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,125
we believe, not that, but we are sure,

173
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,542
that we all are quite capable

174
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,667
and blessed by God, that we should enter into His kingdom.

175
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:18,625
If you take this kind of a positive attitude

176
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:23,375
your negativity will go away. Negative forces,

177
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,417
as you know, you have been pulled down

178
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:31,125
by this kind of a thing or that kind of a thing. Specially after Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,000
Before Sahaja yoga we are not attached

180
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,208
to any families or anything. After Sahaja Yoga

181
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,166
you just got attached to your families

182
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,291
like, glued to them, absolutely glued.

183
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,583
I mean I had to solve

184
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,625
everybody's family problem. Now we have marriages

185
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,208
and even [THE...del], after marriages, I find still people

186
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,542
don't understand what is a Sahaja Yoga marriage,

187
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,291
and there are still some problems, very few,

188
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:58,792
but there are. So this nonsensical problem of my family,

189
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:02,999
my wife, my children, my house, my property, my money

190
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,667
- all this "my" should be finished first of all.

191
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:11,500
You have to belong to the world. Any person

192
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,375
who is a king does not belong to his kingdom,

193
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:18,667
is a failure, is useless. If he thinks about himself,

194
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,417
about his own comfort, about his own fame,

195
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:27,667
about his own achievements, then he's a failure.

196
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:33,250
He has to think about the country, on which he's ruling.

197
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,875
In the same way you have to also, turn your mind away

198
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,709
from all these petty things

199
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,834
that you have been dealing with.

200
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,041
I've been struggling with you, trying to help you

201
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,000
for every small little nonsensical things.

202
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,583
And many people said that, "Mother, why should you worry?

203
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,250
You are a Saint. Why should you worry about these things?"

204
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,834
I said, "Unless and until these entanglements are taken away,

205
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:59,625
they are not going to come up." But now, now, you do feel that freedom.

206
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:04,417
Complete freedom. You are an individual. You are absolutely free.

207
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,250
And the source of your joy is your spirit.

208
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,625
You are not entangled with anyone.

209
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,458
You are not any way attached to anyone.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,208
In that detachment you are going to nourish everyone,

211
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,917
inclusive of so-called your family, your people,

212
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,999
your country and ultimately the world.

213
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,667
So to get rid of negativity first, important thing

214
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,041
is to learn detachment. Detachment comes through

215
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,625
thoughtless awareness. When you look

216
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,083
at anyone or start thinking about anyone,

217
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,875
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

218
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,667
Immediately you'll feel detached and you'll know

219
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,625
the solution of the whole problem.

220
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,750
Now the greatest power you have is in your brain.

221
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,875
That you are knowledgeable. Not knowledgeable the way

222
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,000
you understand that what is the chakra,

223
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,667
what is the center. Not that. But there's

224
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,166
all knowledge within you.

225
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,458
Just you have to, get into thoughtless awareness,

226
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,709
and the whole library of knowledge can open to you.

227
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:10,583
You know so many of you have never been speaking

228
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,542
on the stage, they had stage fear,

229
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,792
and you have become great speakers.

230
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,792
So many of you were possessed people,

231
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,083
who couldn't even stand before Me,

232
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,458
have now become, leaders

233
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,083
and are doing good job.

234
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:29,917
In every field you'll find that you have advanced so much.

235
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,583
So many people who never knew how to sing

236
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,000
have started singing. Did not know how to paint

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,083
have started painting. But these are, very very

238
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:42,667
mundane things which may give us little pleasures

239
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,709
here and there. But the main thing is how many people

240
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,458
we give realization to. Whether you are a woman,

241
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,166
whether you are a man, whether you are a father,

242
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,750
whether you are a mother, whether you are a child

243
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:59,417
or a grown-up. Everybody has to see how many people

244
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,625
we can give realization to, how much we can announce

245
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,375
about Sahaja Yoga. That's the main thing.

246
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,083
Sahaja Yoga is not "by the way". And it happens.

247
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,417
Like when I went to Australia I was surprised, that,

248
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,959
Sahaja Yoga which was such a prime thing for them,

249
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,792
suddenly became "by the way".

250
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:21,999
So Sahaja Yoga is a commitment. Is a commitment.

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,959
And complete involvement.

252
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,542
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja Yoga.

253
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,375
Absolutely useless. It's better to have few people

254
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:33,583
who are committed than to have thousands who are just useless.

255
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,166
So let us see what you have decided for yourself

256
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,667
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:44,333
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga then just,

258
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,834
know that, this is the main thing which you have to do.

259
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:50,000
The whole attention should be on that.

260
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,208
As I told this morning, a very good poem

261
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,542
written by Namadeva and once was included

262
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:02,291
in the Guru Granth Sahib, that a boy is playing

263
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,000
with his kite and the kite is flying in the air.

264
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,667
He's talking to everyone, but his attention

265
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:11,583
is on the kite. There's a lady who is doing

266
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,667
all the household work. She's doing all the cleaning

267
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:19,999
but the child is [ON HER.del.]on her back or on her waist.

268
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,834
All her attention is on the child. Then there are ladies

269
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,999
who are taking water home. There's a water pitcher

270
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,500
on their heads, sometimes two, sometimes three.

271
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,458
They are carrying, balancing it.

272
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,208
They are talking to each other, laughing.

273
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,667
The whole attention is on the balance. In the same way

274
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:41,583
your attention should be, all the time on Sahaja Yoga,

275
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,625
"What's happening in Sahaja Yoga? Where are we?

276
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,917
Where are we going? Where is Mother? What part She is?

277
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:53,750
What is She doing?" That is, now if you put

278
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,417
your attention to, your negativity,

279
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:59,834
will absolutely disappear because attention

280
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,417
which was involved into negative things

281
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,959
will get absolutely detached and you'll start thinking

282
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,083
about Sahaja Yoga. So now as you are mahayogis

283
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,667
we have to make it a Mahayoga. And unless and until

284
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,125
that level is achieved by you then we should think that

285
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,917
we are still backdated and I don't know in the turning

286
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:24,917
of the wheel how many will be left, there.

287
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:28,375
So this is very big turning point and today

288
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:33,583
is a very great day for us because, Sahasrara today,

289
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:38,542
has completed its twenty-one years and like that

290
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:43,208
it is has twenty-one aspects. Seven the chakras.

291
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,083
Seven into three of your nadis.

292
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:53,000
So it's twenty-one aspects, you have able to achieve

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,834
and the twenty-one powers. You just experiment

294
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,458
and see for yourself. Don't doubt yourself.

295
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,166
Just experiment. First you used to even doubt

296
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,542
if there is cool breeze or not, you used to think

297
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,792
it's an air conditioner working in London.

298
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,834
Even London they used to think there must be

299
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,917
air conditioner in their head. Now those days are gone.

300
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:19,667
Now don't doubt yourself and just go, full ahead,

301
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:22,125
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.

302
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:29,500
So the maryada has to be there. Except that the moral maryadas

303
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:37,125
and also, of, behavioral, maryadas,

304
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,834
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

305
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:43,250
You can do what you like, you can live the way you like,

306
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:47,166
you can eat the way you want to eat. But the main maryada

307
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,625
is that you have to be very moral people,

308
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:55,792
honest moral people. And also, you have to be,

309
00:21:55,834 --> 00:22:01,333
in a way, in appearance, in behavior, such a person

310
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,291
that you do not become obnoxious or people don't think

311
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:10,166
you are queer, strange, people. To overcome that,

312
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:14,959
we have to dress up, in a way that is, rather more

313
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,500
appealing to the general public and people see us

314
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:22,667
as normal human being and as not abnormal human beings.

315
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:27,375
There's not much to be done outside. It is the inside,

316
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,999
where we'll have to prepare ourselves, fully,

317
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,041
to accept ourselves. To tell ourselves, every day,

318
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,709
that we are now mahayogis and we have

319
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,000
to work it out that way. Today we have here,

320
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,792
people from all over the world, and you go and tell

321
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:44,792
this message to all the rest of the people

322
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,999
whom I've not met that, "Mother has already announced

323
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,208
- through the Vishnumaya also - that

324
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:57,834
you all have become now, mahayogis." And try to express

325
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,417
that. Manifest that. With full confidence in yourself.

326
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:06,000
And with this power of love I'm sure you'll all win over.

327
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:21,999
May God bless you all.

328
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,500
There has been nothing written about Sahasrara before.

329
00:23:24,542 --> 00:23:27,250
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is described.

330
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,500
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

331
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,625
They just, left it as the seventh chakra.

332
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,291
Finished. They could only go up to Agnya,

333
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,959
and nothing has been written about Sahasrara so far.

334
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:43,000
And there is no, no mantras written about Sahasrara.

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,083
So we have to now write Sahasrara Mantra.

336
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:52,417
It is very surprising, that even the photographs

337
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,000
of Sahasraras have appeared now for you to see,

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,500
that your Sahasraras are opening and that is something

339
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,000
that never happened before, in the whole spiritual history.

340
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:09,917
And nobody could write about it because,

341
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:13,667
they never saw this Sahasrara. Now for you

342
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:17,583
it is important to see, that you have something

343
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,291
so unique with you. But only thing what you need

344
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:30,250
is a courage and a complete commitment, to go forward

345
