1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Today's Puja is a very great Puja for Me,

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:12,083
because I suddenly find that My granddaughter is missing,

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:16,125
and I got upset with it very much.

4
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:22,250
Look at Me, supposed to be Adi Shakti,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,125
and why should I get so upset
about My granddaughter missing?

6
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:34,500
It was just a human nature,

7
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,667
which I realized all of us have.

8
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:48,250
If we have some responsibility

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:55,458
and we are not there, we get upset.

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,625
Thank God there are very few children here,

11
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,458
most of them have gone.

12
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,959
But we are all children

13
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,500
the way we worry, the way we are anxious.

14
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:22,125
Today I would like all of you to say

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,542
that a New Year has come.

16
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:34,458
And in this New Year we all should have

17
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,333
a new proposal about ourselves.

18
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:44,667
And that proposal is very difficult for people to make out

19
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:49,375
- that we are not responsible for anyone.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,917
We are our own, and we live with ourselves.

21
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,417
It's very difficult.

22
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,083
Of course those who have no children

23
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,000
are very happy people that way.

24
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,083
But those who have,

25
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:13,709
those who have certain responsibilities

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,208
and commitments they are still hanging in the air.

27
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:27,041
They are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga, I must say.

28
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,542
Our main responsibility is ourselves,

29
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,291
is to know ourselves

30
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,166
and to depend on ourselves.

31
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,667
It is a very big responsibility,

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,250
because now as we will be having big functions

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,917
and we might feel that we are lost in it.

34
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,458
Please, try to remember

35
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,500
that  you have to remember your Self.

36
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,667
You have to know that you are there.

37
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,208
That's the message I wanted to give you.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,417
I hope you'll think it over.

39
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:22,041
May God bless you all!
