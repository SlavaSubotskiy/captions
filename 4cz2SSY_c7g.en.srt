00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:54,199
you know no no - the child they normally

3
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:57,440
would be replaced the prophetess turn us

00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,350
into karate demand rain medicine demo

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,170
pseudo poverty spattering they were

6
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,610
simply genetically mediated the ProQuest

7
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:10,880
was in Jerusalem and she I'm so happy

8
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:14,509
that in Italy people have so much

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:20,300
respect for my dear mother and also for

10
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:23,810
Madonna surprising why they did not

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,280
describe about Christ's mother in the

12
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,340
Bible the last words spoken of Christ

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,649
where he say behold the mother in all

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,569
other scriptures of the world this

15
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,399
primordial mother is respect and

16
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:40,840
everybody has talked about that that

17
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,840
she's the power she's the ship

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,810
[Music]

19
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:12,669
[Applause]

20
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:33,110
I think it's it's a little fragile it

21
00:02:28,670 --> 00:03:00,780
was it was repaid by misogyny and

22
00:02:33,110 --> 00:03:03,780
repainted it is said that

23
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,830
in the ten commandments whatever is

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:12,270
created by the heavens and by the earth

25
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:17,220
should not be recreated and reproduced

26
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:22,050
and worshipped so the incarnations are

27
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,270
created by the heavens only in modern

28
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:29,340
times it is possible to take a

29
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:34,459
photograph of the incarnation but in the

30
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:38,060
former days there was no possibility now

31
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:42,290
whatever is created by the mother earth

32
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:46,560
is what has come out of the mother earth

33
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,530
which is the swayambhu is created by the

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,150
mother earth now we have everywhere we

35
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,890
find the same blue things

36
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,720
another thing is some realized Souls

37
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:07,470
also have made beautiful statue

38
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:10,560
there was one fellow in Russia supposed

39
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,540
to be very intelligent he said that all

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,620
right if we keep mother's photograph and

41
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:21,209
also the icons we can get the same type

42
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:25,500
of vibration you cannot because icons

43
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:28,710
are made by some artists imaginary these

44
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,900
are not representing actually even Maria

45
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,400
or Christ or anyone they are all all

46
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:39,560
imaginary if an Italian once makes

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:44,640
Christ he is Italian stuff he somebody

48
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:49,500
French one makes is thin like French if

49
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,580
you get somebody say from Holland he'll

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,580
have a forehead like that

51
00:04:52,729 --> 00:05:00,690
you see all of them

52
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:02,539
they depict Christ as they want to then

53
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,470
we have Maria the same way

54
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:10,710
her expression her photograph everything

55
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,860
is all according to the imagination of

56
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,720
the artists and to whatever country we

57
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,419
belong that way and they are not free

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,770
you can see they are not free because

59
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:29,400
all these artists have a certain style

60
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:33,750
now if it is a Rembrandt it's a style if

61
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,729
it is a Leonardo it's a style though

62
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,250
they are born realized still they have a

63
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,870
style nobody is like this that he make

64
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,080
today like these tomorrow like this

65
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,090
there's no freedom

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,090
they are bound by their own styles

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,810
everybody has one style and that is the

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,349
style they follow because what is that

69
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,530
his reason is they must have done three

70
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:06,210
four times style type styles must have

71
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:10,020
done sure but people must have rejected

72
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,780
this is no good this is no good so it's

73
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,400
all to see opinion of the people so they

74
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,610
must have taken to one style all right

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,590
this is the stand so you can see Christ

76
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,699
if he's Japanese

77
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,699
he'll have [ __ ] eyes

78
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:34,180
if he is Chinese she'll have no nose if

79
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:38,949
it's Indian he'll be doubt so all kinds

80
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:44,379
of crisis II and I feel that how can

81
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:47,800
they emit vibrations tell me while with

82
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,740
my photograph our cunning company now

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,990
when we say that we should not worship

84
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,330
in the Bible it is written that we

85
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,479
should not worship anything that is

86
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,879
reproduced and created by the mother

87
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,129
earth and the heavens now what is it

88
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,560
what is it created by the mother earth

89
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,080
and by the heaven which we should not

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,150
reproduce this nobody tried to find out

91
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,599
they think that you are not allowed to

92
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:16,990
worship any form it's all

93
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,139
misinterpretation it's completely

94
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,879
misinterpretation I'll tell you very in

95
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:29,050
Paris a church called what is it called

96
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:33,099
them or not reserved and the under

97
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,199
statue of Mary and Christ is celebrating

98
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,419
from outside you can see the vibrations

99
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,659
are coming out now this must have been

100
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,409
made by some very great artist who was a

101
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,210
realized soul

102
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:51,789
for example the Sistine Chapel ego has

103
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,860
got a very beautiful frescoes of Christ

104
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:58,930
and all that and if you see that Christ

105
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:02,020
I mean it's absolutely vibrate but down

106
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,639
below there's a big table on which to

107
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:10,000
have put Christ just very miserable

108
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,590
creature which is never near Christ I

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,469
mean it's impossible that Christ would

110
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,250
be like that so miserable ugly looking

111
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:20,469
thin burnout hopelessness

112
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:25,180
how can he be Christ I can't understand

113
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:26,830
he carried a complete huge big cross

114
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,169
upon himself do you think these bowls

115
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,079
could have can and this was placed just

116
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,800
below where Sistine Chapel you find the

117
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:38,390
Christ and energy boy how can it be

118
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,620
also the mother of Christ is always

119
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:46,190
shown as a fat person modern fashion

120
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,790
that should become like a mosquito you

121
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:56,720
will go is a famous painting Mona Lisa

122
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:59,590
he was a very fat is all the trace of

123
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:03,580
the intervenors you are playing into

124
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,820
they are making a fool out of everyone

125
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:13,580
the divine personality needs water to

126
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:16,250
protect the center I'll do an example of

127
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:19,010
Mona Lisa if you see Mona Lisa I mean I

128
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,860
don't know she cannot be an actress she

129
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:26,270
cannot win any beauty contests I think

130
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:31,130
she her face is very serene very

131
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:33,110
motherly very pure her eyes and why is

132
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,720
it that she's eternally so much

133
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,160
appreciated the reason is there is

134
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,010
Ganesh impersonator

135
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,070
she's a mother and the story about that

136
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:45,620
one is that this lady had lost her child

137
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,990
and she would never spoil she would

138
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,450
never cry and one little child was

139
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,600
brought to her when she saw the child

140
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,030
then the spine that came on her face of

141
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,910
that love for the child is being

142
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,190
depicted by this great artist and that's

143
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,630
why people are appreciating it and you

144
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,080
have seen in the West though the people

145
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,590
don't show much interest in the mother

146
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,950
child relationships anywhere you go is

147
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,090
the mother and child theme is the best

148
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,130
they'd show you photograph this is

149
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,290
mother and child this is Christ mother

150
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,240
and child when the Christ was brought

151
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,530
down the mother is there they have to

152
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,500
have mother and her child

153
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,350
principal acting otherwise that picture

154
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,720
is not regarded as something great or

155
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,540
you have to have actually Christ who is

156
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,540
a Ganesh principal himself to be sure

157
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:47,160
he wants to know about the appearance of

158
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,399
Holy Mary for example in Fatima on other

159
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,790
addresses mitre is quite possible you

160
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,730
see one of my photographs where people

161
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,910
are taking photographs and she's there

162
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:05,790
she's appeared before me also it's

163
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:10,559
possible I went to Portugal and they had

164
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:17,129
a festival of the Lady of the rocks so I

165
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:21,120
went to see that place and there was a

166
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:25,199
very small little statue of this diamond

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:29,420
height of the middle about say five

168
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:34,740
inches and the face was just like mine

169
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:38,850
exactly like mine they said that this

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,809
was found suddenly by two children who

171
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:47,639
were following a rabbit which hid inside

172
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:49,769
a niche so these children saw some light

173
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:54,480
inside the niche and they started

174
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:56,490
following under a rock and they reached

175
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,180
the source of the light was the statue

176
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,430
they brought it out and in that light

177
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,680
they walked and when the people outside

178
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,120
where lots of people were gathered they

179
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,059
were amazed to see that they brought out

180
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,250
the statue from somewhere inside so they

181
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:17,250
worshiped that that statue in that place

182
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:22,529
now please think these statues give you

183
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:27,870
vibrations as I give you vibrations but

184
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:30,839
not so much as I give it and all the

185
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:35,250
other statues also there may be many who

186
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:38,670
might be giving you vibrations and also

187
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,670
there was an operation of her first I

188
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,999
never believed that it could be but then

189
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:49,110
after feeling the vibrations now I know

190
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:52,740
it was true that she did appear here in

191
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,939
an operation she appeared before me also

192
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,259
you must have seen

193
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:59,849
in a photograph of course I like

194
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:03,659
paintings very much up for a file

195
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:06,149
specially because he has drawn the

196
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:09,959
mother's face and the child's face so

197
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:15,059
exactly expressing the feeling of mother

198
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:18,659
entity and imagine that picture appears

199
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,729
in the sky and I didn't tell them to

200
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:24,359
show that the father when I was sleeping

201
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:27,539
I was not even going to look at it but

202
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:31,339
at this time the hollow that was on the

203
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:34,079
backside of Bailey comes up on the head

204
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,439
in Suffern himself innate or I don't

205
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,329
know how can I explain this

206
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:44,159
paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of

207
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:49,769
things and it does all these just to

208
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:52,999
convince you about sahaja yoga we have

209
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:57,779
seen photographs of angels around me so

210
00:13:52,999 --> 00:14:03,149
try to be simple innocent not reacting

211
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:05,989
and keep quiet and peaceful because here

212
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:08,970
we are talking about the global

213
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:11,459
transformation where people will find

214
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:17,659
their peace in that heart and will

215
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:17,659
establish a new world of peace joy

216
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:22,369
spirituality
