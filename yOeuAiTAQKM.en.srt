1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,680
This centre what we call as "left Vishuddhi".

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,440
Now have you told them about left Vishuddhi?

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
Not, not specific sides, you know, just the general principle.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,520
All right. Now, this left Vishuddhi comes to you

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,000
if you have said mantras wrongly.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,920
You see, the mantras are to be said only when there is

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,960
a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,760
And if you do not know

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
about it, you accept the mantras.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,600
Anybody who tells you, "Say this mantra", you just start saying it,

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,320
without understanding, whether it is given by an authority or not.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,680
Maybe it is not required for some.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,320
Any particular mantra may not be required.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,680
And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,200
So mantras also, it's a very big science.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,160
And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,320
Also one feels it, even if you have not taken mantras, if

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,160
you have been feeling guilty.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,680
Like, you see, if you are used to confessions and things like that,

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,240
if you are used to a situation where you feel that

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,960
"I'm guilty for this". You know, the norms of today's modern life

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
are so funny, that even for small thing you have to feel guilty.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
For example if you put the fork in a wrong way,

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,080
you feel guilty: "Oh God, I should not have done this."

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,160
Like that, the life is so complicated,

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,440
but very, very small things can also make you feel guilty.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,280
So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,360
Now, this centre is very important, because

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,120
if this centre is not all right, then Kundalini doesn't rise.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,640
She pulls

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,560
this, at this point. Half of it is pulled out.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,880
And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Now, one should not feel guilty about anything, whatsoever!

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,720
There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,360
and all the time saying, "I am such a sinner"

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
and I should not have done this and I should not have done that.

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,400
Because, as I told you yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,640
He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,120
So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Moreover you are the temple of God.

42
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
And if you condemn yourself like that,

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,600
that "I'm good for nothing, I am useless",

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,360
then you are condemning that temple which is created by God.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,440
You have not created yourself.

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,920
So you have no right to condemn yourself.

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,720
Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Because I am talking of the ocean.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,320
So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,200
So one should not feel guilty.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,240
Now see, are you feeling the vibrations now? Let's see.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,800
Can I ask? Can you hear Mother over there?

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,280
Come along. If you can't hear, come along here!

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,200
Can you come? There is some nice space over, just around here,

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,160
if there is anybody at the back who can't hear.

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,760
It's a little difficult with the traffic noises.

57
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
Mother is talking about this center

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,880
which is represented on this finger here.

59
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,040
and saying that it can catch if,

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,440
if there are mantras spoken which are inappropriate.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,240
If the mantras being spoken

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,520
or chanted are wrong, are inappropriate

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,840
or there is not an authority to use those mantras,

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
then the left Vishuddhi is out.

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,400
And at the moment Mother is feeling that left Vishuddhi here.

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Also another reason for that is a sense of guilt.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,760
If you feel a sense of guilt, guilt for anything that you've done.

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,960
And Mother is pointing out that...

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,720
that guilt, I mean, what have we done?

70
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,720
Little, little things, whatever sins that we have committed.

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,760
How can we feel guilty when God is

72
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,200
all compassion, all love, all forgiveness?

73
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,640
So it's forgiving others and forgiving ourselves

74
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,360
and also stopping unauthorized mantras,

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
which can clear that catch, on this,

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,440
which is represented on this left finger here, the left Vishuddhi.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,120
That means you have to be cheerful people.

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,640
When you are entering into the kingdom of God

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,680
you have to be cheerful people.

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,960
Now, so many people who have a heart trouble

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,120
are very much affected by this blockage.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,200
If there is, this blockage is there, it's difficult

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
to cure the heart of a person.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,480
So first of all we should say that, "We are not guilty at all."

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,480
Believe Me, you are not guilty.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,720
If you believe Me, it will work out.

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,200
- It's better now? - The same.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Same? Not feeling anything?

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,960
Put it up. It will help you. Better now.

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
- Are you feeling guilty? - I'm not feeling anything.

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,280
- But are you feeling guilty? - I try not to.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,840
She tries not to.

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,320
But why... Just say, "I'm not guilty." Can you say that?

94
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,800
"Mother, I am not guilty!" Say within yourself.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Just say it honestly. You say that you are not guilty, that's all.

96
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,200
Better now? Working out.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,320
Just say one little thing, that "Mother, I am not guilty."

98
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
This is a mantra to overcome this center.

99
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,680
It is a simple mantra to say that.

100
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,240
"Mother, I am not guilty" is the mantra for the left Vishuddhi.

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,080
Just put your hands straight.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,600
From Hamsa.

103
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,200
- Are you all right? - Yes!

104
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,160
[Hindi/Marathi]

105
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,320
[Hindi/Marathi]

106
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,560
What about you, people? You're feeling it? Good!

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
- Are you still not feeling? - Little warm.

108
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,280
Warm, all right, doesn't matter, warm will be all right.

109
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,640
Now first of all let us correct, that there should be a feeling,

110
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,920
already starting. It may be that it is little warm, all right.

111
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,960
Now, this one, this finger is little bit touching.

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Now, this is a very important finger

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,120
because this represents your heart, the organ. The heart.

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
That means you have to accept that you are the Spirit.

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,720
Because the Spirit resides in your heart.

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,440
So you have to accept that you are the heart.

117
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,360
And Spirit cannot commit any mistakes also.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,840
So both things go hand in hand.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
You have to accept that you are the Spirit.

120
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,880
So you can again put your right hand on your..

121
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,760
This finger here - the left heart

122
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
which is the source of the Spirit.

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,680
No, is the Spirit inside.

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,560
So you have to say, "I am the Spirit."

125
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,840
Say it with full confidence: "I am the Spirit!"

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,120
Spirit means the Atma

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,840
and not the spirit that we know of the spirits

128
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,240
that about which I'm going to tell you tonight.

129
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,760
Better now?

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,320
It can't even cross Hamsa.

131
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,000
Are you feeling better, by saying that?

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,120
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

133
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,720
You had some guru or someone? - No.

134
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,600
No.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
Don't worry! It will work out.

136
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm going to see everyone individually.

137
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
All right? But let's see how far it goes. We can do it.

138
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,400
Better. It's improving.

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,680
Mother earth is very nice.

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,480
I have to bow to Australia, this land, to suck in your problems.

141
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,960
Started sucking.

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,720
So now it's cooled down.

143
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
All right?

144
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,120
You came today or you have come yesterday. Yesterady or today?

145
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,680
Now, if you are feeling hot, very hot, the thing, if it is,

146
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
the sensation is hot

147
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,200
that means first of all, you must be having a liver problem.

148
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,200
If not, you could have been to some guru

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,040
and that's why there is an opposition.

150
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,240
So now, what you do, is to put your right hand on your liver.

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm sorry, left hand on your liver.

152
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,520
Left hand on your liver.

153
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
Better.

154
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,040
Is it still hot now? Better now? Better.

155
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160
Please put it comfortably on your lap.

156
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,960
All the skin troubles come from liver.

157
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Allergies come from lethargic liver.

158
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,160
And those who have other troubles of the liver, like

159
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,160
sometimes you feel like vomiting, nauseating,

160
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,520
your attention is not all right, all that comes from bad liver.

161
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,640
So for that we have to understand that,

162
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,160
carbohydrates are required

163
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,400
to compensate for the over-activity that you are doing.

164
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,760
Now, if you get tonight some sugar and salt,

165
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,960
all of you, I will vibrate it for you and you can use it.

166
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,280
That will solve your problem of the liver. It's better now.

167
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
Just put it like that, straight. Are you feeling better?

168
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,400
- It's cold. - See, it cooled down.

169
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,640
Now don't doubt, it is cool.

170
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,520
I mean cool and hot, even a child can say.

171
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,440
So there is nothing to doubt.

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,680
The meeting, Mother, is tomorrow night.

173
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm sorry, tomorrow night. The meeting is tomorrow night.

174
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,240
For those who didn't hear what Mother said (rice and) sugar and salt,

175
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,280
you bring in to the programm on Monday night

176
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
and She will vibrate it. You put it with your household supply

177
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,160
and then it will be vibrated and will clear these problems

178
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,040
which we are speaking about. So bring a small quantity,

179
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,520
maybe half a kilo, something like that.

180
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Also water. If you have got spring water, you can bring spring water

181
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,520
because this water is very troublesome.

182
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,080
Yes, spring water is better.

183
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,880
Thanks to floods.

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,520
Sit down! How are you today? All right? Good morning.

185
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
It's better.

186
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,800
Now one has to know that the

187
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,160
sprouting of the seed has taken place.

188
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,440
But to make it grow more

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,800
you have to work on other people.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
You have to give it to others.

191
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,520
If you don't learn to share it, then it doesn't grow.

192
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,840
It will again subside. And it will be,

193
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,120
you will feel that you have lost your vibrations.

194
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,520
So the best thing would be

195
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,360
that you must learn how to give it to others.

196
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Now who is feeling cool breeze among you

197
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,040
can come and now try on this gentleman.

198
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,520
Let's see one or two persons, let's try how it works out.

199
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,600
Anybody would like to try? All right.

200
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,200
I'm just going to show you how to work it out [in a kind of a show].

201
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Go forward, if you're feeling the cool breeze.- One or two persons,

202
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
now come along.

203
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,400
Now come along. You sit down here.

204
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Come along.

205
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,840
Sit down like this, all right? So all of you can see them.

206
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, can you come to work Warren.

207
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,720
As it is now you are putting both the hands towards Me.

208
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
All right? First of all.

209
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,400
Now when I'm not there, you can use My photograph

210
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
because photograph also has got vibrations.

211
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,320
Till you feel all right you can use it, the photograph. All right.

212
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,320
She is very pale and liver is very bad.

213
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,920
I think she's... You've been to this divine light business?

214
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
I do not know it. I do not know it.

215
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,160
She's been a disciple of the Guru Maharaji.

216
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,720
No, I haven't got knowledge, I've just been going to the meetings.

217
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,080
Going to the meetings, same thing.

218
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,440
Knowledge, never have God knowledge. ( You'll never get it anyway.)

219
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,280
All right, now, yes, all right, now put your hand -

220
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,360
you never get the knowledge, you get the mesmerism. All right.

221
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,320
Put it on that... let's see. Now, let's see now.

222
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,640
You just tell Me... Please put your left hand towards Me,

223
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,520
and right hand on top and tell Me what do you feel on your fingers.

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,760
- Get heat on left, Mother. - That's all right.

225
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
You have been to some guru also. Have you not been?

226
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
You see, if it is catching on the left hand side

227
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,120
that means either you have some emotional problem

228
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,080
or you have been to a wrong guru. All right?

229
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,440
That's it. She too has the same problem.

230
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,760
- All right? - Heat on the left side.

231
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,840
Now, what you do you put your hand down there

232
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,880
and you have to say that

233
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,600
"Mother, I'm my own guru!" Just say that.

234
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Establish your guru principle, that's all.

235
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,280
Say it in your heart now.

236
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,880
"I am my own master, I am my own guru."

237
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,280
You all can do it. Those who have been to guru you all can do it.

238
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,840
Please put your...

239
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,920
as they have put left hand towards Me and right hand here.

240
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,960
Come over and do it here. One of you come over here and do it.

241
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,360
Better? Go on saying that.

242
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,400
Just close your eyes and say that.

243
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Just close your eyes and say "Mother, I am my own guru."

244
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,280
Just say that.

245
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Things will improve, you'll see that.

246
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,480
It starts to cool down on the left hand.

247
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,240
Now better? See, see it is...

248
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,960
Better now.

249
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,080
All right. Good? All right now?

250
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,040
All right, now this is your mantra for the time beeing.

251
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
Is to say "Mother, I am my own guru."

252
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,000
Use My photograph and you have to say that.

253
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,680
And it will be corrected. See now.

254
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,840
This is better. Can you see in your finger?

255
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,680
You see, see how fingers are.

256
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,320
You see, there is enlightenment in this part.

257
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,040
But this part is still not so good, all right?

258
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Now, this kind of a hand, if you see, yellowish colour, all right?

259
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,600
It means liver. This is a liver patient,

260
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,120
definitely a liver patient, this one.

261
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,560
Now, for such a hand, what should you do, is to take

262
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,640
the water that I've given you

263
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,880
and boil it with radish leaves.

264
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,800
And take radish leaves and sugar with it.

265
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,800
That water you have to take for some time.

266
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,080
Specially when you have this flood water.

267
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,200
After that you should be careful, because people can get jaundice.

268
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,000
You see, this flood is not such a disaster.

269
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,240
The after effects of floods are. This water is not good,

270
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,080
you should not take any other water but spring water.

271
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,480
Spring water you should drink

272
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,440
and as far as possible be careful about jaundice.

273
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,840
If jaundice sets in, the only solution is that

274
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,520
you should take radish leaves, eat lot of radish

275
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,600
and boil it in that water that I give you today

276
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,880
and put some sugar in it

277
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,200
and just take that water, nothing else.

278
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,920
Because that's one thing one has to be careful

279
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,840
when such a flood comes in

280
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,840
the after effects of the floods can be felt.

281
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,560
All right? So we have to save the Realised souls.

282
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,440
They are very precious to God.

283
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,080
And you must know how to save yourself from all these problems.

284
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,760
So you are - you should go when you drink the water today

285
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,480
you also radish leaves, you should take. Boil them.

286
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,720
All right? It doesn't taste very well, put the sugar in it.

287
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,440
And you take that water for some time

288
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,640
and not any other water, as far as possible, say 2 days or 3 days.

289
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,360
Immediately you will find, this will go away

290
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,840
and you will feel better. Now, it's better now.

291
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,320
It's the colour is much better, can you see that?

292
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
It's much better colour now? The red is coming now, see?

293
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,160
It's much better, see, but

294
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,400
it has to be done in such a way that it's established.

295
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,040
See now her hand. See now, her hand is better? You see?

296
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,520
This is normal colour, that redness, all right?

297
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,960
Still yellow, still yellow, but not that much.

298
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,680
It's very yellow thing, all right?

299
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,760
Jaundice. Do you get jaundice in this country?

300
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
Yes, very much.

301
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
So one should know how to treat jaundice and

302
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,600
look after yourself. Jaundice is really, could be fatal and

303
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,480
it's very dangerous, because it spoils your liver very badly.

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
So, to be on safe side, eat lot of radish

305
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,800
and also take that water as I told you, for your jaundice.

306
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,800
Are you all right now?

307
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,920
Now let us see two other people. All right, come.

308
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,320
Coulple of other people come forward.

309
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Now you come here. Both of you. Let's start.

310
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Now, who will try? [Hindi/Marathi]

311
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,520
One more person who would like to work.

312
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,160
Anyone who wants to work out?

313
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,480
You see, they are here. Why don't you come? Come here, that's it.

314
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,960
You have been to some gurus?

315
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,160
Which one?

316
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,560
None specifically. None specifically.

317
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
- To everyone. - No, I just moved around.

318
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,720
You are a seeker. All right, doesn't matter!

319
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,760
So for you the best is, first of all to put this hand down there.

320
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,960
And you have to say, that "Mother, I'm my own guru."

321
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,360
Is she getting cool breeze on her head?

322
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,200
Cool. You work on here.

323
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,080
Here, you just work on him. He's a difficult...

324
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Is it cool on her head? - Yes.

325
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,760
It's all right. Are you feeling all right, My child?

326
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,760
Put your left hand to Mother,

327
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,920
and your right hand and left hand. You tell Her what you feel.

328
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,880
Give him a bandhan.

329
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,440
We do this to protect the...

330
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,040
[Hindi/Marathi]

331
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,400
[Hindi/Marathi]

332
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
See this hands are shaking on the right.

333
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,080
[Hindi/Marathi]

334
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,800
[Hindi/Marathi]

335
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,360
- Still shaking. - Shaking. [Hindi/Marathi]

336
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,040
[Hindi/Marathi]

337
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,320
Somebody else come on here.

338
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,720
I'll just tell you what is to be done.

339
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,520
Now, if your right hand shakes before the photograph...

340
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,320
You see, there are so many permutations and combinations,

341
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,960
but some of the major ones, I'll tell you.

342
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,040
If the right hand shakes means you work very hard, first of all,

343
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,360
you think too much of the future,

344
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,880
you are using too much of your right side energy, which I will show.

349
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,240
Under these, under these circumstances

350
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,120
you have to put your right hand towards the photograph

351
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,760
or towards Me just now

352
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,320
and put your left hand - if your right hand is shaking.

353
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,880
Is it shaking now? See for yourself!

354
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
You put your right hand to Mother

355
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,760
And the other on the Mother Earth!

356
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
If your right hand is hot or shaking put your right hand

357
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,080
to the Mother and your left hand on the earth.

358

Just for those people only.

-Hot or more hot on the left or shaking.- Centre heart.

360

Put it towards Mother and the other hand on the earth.

361
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,760
You get asthma?

362
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,960
What you're doing is you are acting as a transmitter

363
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
or the battery, and cool.

364
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,120
Now, is he all right? - Is he getting cooler?

365
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,440
Now, will you say that "Mother, I am my own teacher",

366
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,920
"I am my own Guru"?

367
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,120
We don't have to search any gurus.

368
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,960
Is somebody getting the right hand shaking? Just see. Sit down.

369
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,560
Check it now! Everybody just check it, to see how the right hand is.

373
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Work on this. It's a little blocked. It's severely hot

374
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
here, Mother, on when she's feeling.

375

All right? Press it hard.

She's feeling a severe heat there.

377
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,080
Press it hard.

378
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,280
He must have taken some drugs also. Left Nabhi is also.

379
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,960
Did you take some drugs?

380
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,560
Not so much.

381
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,400
But you did sometimes. Because you see, everything has an effect.

382
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,080
A little bit. Now, let's see, is better?

383
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,960
Are you married? - No.

384
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,240
So you will be marrying. You've not decided not to marry, have you?

385
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,160
(- That's right! -) You will marry in case, ?

386
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,960
You're quit happy to get married, are you?

387
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,440
Yes, all right. Now see, better?

388
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,520
Are you feeling less heat on left? Less heat.

389
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,880
Not completely gone, but it's less.

390
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
Less. o.k., that's clear then.

391
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,280
See how you are feeling.

392
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,760
You see, you are yourself feeling now.

393
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,480
Yesterday you got your Realization, today you are feeling it!

394
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,080
Now tell them how to raise the Kundalini! All of you can see

395
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,600
how to raise the Kundalini of other people. Can you see them?

396
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,120
Tell them how to do it! There you are.

397
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,560
Put your hand down at the bottom of the lowest chakra.

398
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,400
And you work in this fashion.

399
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,440
[One station here]. This is  left Swadisthana.

400
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
Means you have been to some guru also before.

401
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,800
- Christianity, Christianity. - Christian, Christianity, Mother.

402
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Christianity.

403
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,920
Keeping your eyes closed at first to keep your attention inside,

404
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,840
then turn it about seven times and knot it once.

405
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,560
Bring it down like that

406
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,440
and again same.

407
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,720
Keep your attention inside.

408
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Now tell them also. All right. Better now. -Turn it.-

409
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,960
Even you see, Christianity that we follow is not actual,

410
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,760
you see, because they don't give you actually the baptism.

411
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,680
It's all artificial stuff going on in Christianity.

412
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
All right? And I'll better see

413
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,280
Better now? [INAUDIBLE]

414
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Three times and bring it down. Now check the vibrations

415
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,240
and you'll find that there might be a slight increase

416
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,520
in the vibrations. Keep your eyes closed.

417
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,640
Tremendous you are, really! He is getting vibratory sensation.

418
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,120
Don't let your attention [go here and there] just while

419
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,160
you're checking the vibrations and keep your attention inside.

420
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,920
You've been a catholic ?

421
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,880
That's why. Catholicism has given guilt.

422
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,440
That's how, they put you down.

423
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,760
I was converted to Catholicism. I was converted.

424
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
A convert, Mother, she's saying she was a convert.

425
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,760
She wasn't born a Catholic.

426
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,520
Oh, I see. That was a mistake.

427
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
But don't think of the mistake. It's all right.

428
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,040
You can feel it. Now better?

429
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,720
And the other you can balance it out.

430
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,560
Christ is the essence of Christianity,

431
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,760
but not necessarily what has happened since.

432
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,160
He understands that.

433
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,400
Better now? Much better?

434
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,120
Isn't she better now? - Yes.

435
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,120
Yes. Now this lady was a convert, say of Catholicism.

436
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
She went to Catholicism. And you know that

437
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Christianity that is practised is not true Christianity,

438
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,680
in the sense, they do not give you the actual baptism.

439
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,480
Is artificial. Now in Sahaja Yoga you get the actual baptism.

440
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,920
And you start feeling it on your head.

441
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,960
And in her seeking she went out. [unclear- be careful]

442
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,600
Are better. So now, it's better now?

443
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,480
You are feeling it balanced on both hands?

444
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,200
Just come here. Tell her to ask Me the question of Holy Ghost.

445
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,040
Come here, you'll feel better. Come here. He'll tell you something.

446
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,600
Are you better?

447
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,480
Did you feel cool breeze?

448
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,400
I didn't feel any sensations.

449
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,760
He didn't feel any in the hands.

450
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,720
Just work on him. Robert, come along, work on him.

451
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,360
Go, go down there, then work out.

452
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,320
Now ask the question three times.

453
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
Do you get the vibrations?

454
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,760
The vibrations being the truth, all right?

455
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,160
It's nice!

456
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
All right? It's great!

457
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,800
May God bless you! Enjoy yourself! Close your eyes.

Turn around, I would like to put your [unclear]. Just turn around.

460
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,720
Turn around. Come back. Can I open your zip a little?

461
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,120
Now, hold your breath for a minute.

462
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,080
Leave it.

- I'm free. - Free?

465
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,160
All right? Good. May God bless you!

466
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,080
Now let's have two other people.

468
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,760
Come on. Now that was the two of them.

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,240
They are husband and wife. See, that's indian style.

470
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,160
Can you sit to one side, so the camera can record it. That's it.

you come and feel it and then you can come next time. Come on.

474
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,600
Now come along, two people should feel it

475
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,320
and two people should sit down and see for themselves.

476
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,360

Yes.

and he works very hard. See doubly problematic.

497
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,280
So he works very hard, he uses right side too much

498
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,480
so he has to be raised from the left to the right, all right?

- Is it becoming more cool? - Yes.

504

Yes, that's it. See just by giving balance, it's becoming more cool.

-More, more, yes.- Isn't it? More and more. That's true.

540
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,520
It's very cool now Mother. He felt it was...

541
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,080
He's all right. He's all right. He's all right now.

542
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,040
[Hindi/Marathi]

543
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,400
Now, all right? Good.

544
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,280
This gentleman is feeling

545
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,640
more on his right and not very much on his left at all.

546
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,880
Left hand not getting very much sensations.

547
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,320
Yours? Yourself. All right, we'll see you. It's easy.

548
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,120
[Hindi/Marathi] Certified.

549
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,240
[Hindi/Marathi]

550
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,240
[Hindi/Marathi]

551
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,800
Just sit down and Mother will work on you.

552
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,360
Come right forward now. Come in two.

553
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,280
Now, who else? Now who would like to feel?

554
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,960
Could you come?

555
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,360
Yes, yes, let her come!

556
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,480
Come along.

557
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,840
But the wife should not treat the husband.

558
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,600
It is not a very good idea. - So you work on this man.-

559
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,280
You work on this man.- She can work on this one.-

560
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,640
While the left side [pains] you see.

561
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,480
Now you've been to some gurus or something?

562
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,440
Which one?

563
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,400
- Any number? - Yes, several.

564
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,680
All right. Now put your right hand down down.

565
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
All right? Now see now.

566
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:12,160
What's happening? Can you feel it hot on the left?

567
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,760
You have to say that, "Mother, I am my own guru!"

568
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,440
Just say it loudly.

569
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,320
Again! You have to say 10 times, all right?

570
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,960
"Mother, I am my own guru."

571
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,200
"Mother, I am my own guru!"

572
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,520
Void. Cool?

573
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,320
Yes. I think it's void.

574
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,280
It's cooling down! All right? Better now?

575
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,360
Stomach is very much caught up. All right?

576
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,840
- It's gone now. -Since I was a child I think I had tension here.-

577
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,600
All right, doesn't matter. - Just keep still,

578
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,360
we're working on you, you see.

579
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,520
Keep looking at Mother. Just look at Her, all right?

580
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,480
Yesterday you felt the thing there, is it?

581
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,040
Little bit cool above his head is. (unclear)

582
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,160
You see, going to these Gurus is very dangerous.

583
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,960
Because there are ten centres in the stomach.

584
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,920
There are ten petals on that Nabhi chakra, as you call.

585
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,520
Nabhi means the solar plexus.

586
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,760
Now what happens, that if you go to these gurus,

587
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,680
this blockage takes place

588
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,480
and it works out here, what we call as Ekadesha.

589
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,240
And when it starts working out here

590
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,040
cancer can be set in. Anything can be then set in.

591
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,080
So these gurus can be very dangerous.

592
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,800
One should never take them seriously.

593
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,800
Horrible people they are.

594
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,360
Mother is just pointing out that we, in this area,

595
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,120
in the green area there, are ten gurus.

596
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,440
Would you like to come on My feet and work it out better? All right?

597
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Let's see it. Now put your both the hands, and the right [unclear].

598
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,000
Just like this. Now put down your head. And you can see

599
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,880
the Kundalini. If you want to see the Kundalini, you can see his.

600
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,760
Bring your knees further forward and stretch them.

601
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,280
Bring just your knees. Yes, that's it.

602
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,880
As long as you're comfortable. Like, you  go back.

603
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,960
Yes, it is there.

604
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,080
Do you want to see it? It's...

605
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,960
Stretch the cloth down little bit.

606
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,080
Now better?

607
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
[unclear] because it's here

608
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,040
but it also reflects here, that's called the Ekadesha Rudra.

609
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,840
And once that goes out, then things like cancer also can settle.

610
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,240
So it's extremely dangerous.

611
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,160
I mean, you are vulnerable to such dieseases there.

612
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,160
A vulnerable situation comes.

613
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,880
Now just see, are you feeling any cool? Just see!

614
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,200
One hand towards Me. Just see yourself.

615
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,200
Just turn around to raise the Kundalini.

616
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,680
You raise it. - Like this, like this.

617
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,600
Come on, bring it up.

618
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,320
See, normally these gurus don't work at all.

619
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,480
They take money from you, make you a.. and I have to get it cleared.

620
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,160
Got up.

621
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,200
More right it would be better.

622
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,560
It has come up to heart now.

623
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
It's coming.

624
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,360
Like that.

625
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,720
Still you fix his Vishuddhi.

626
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,840
You are all right. All right?

627
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,200
Feeling better now?

628
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,720
See, put your hands towards Me. - Hold your hands!

629
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,880
All right? Better? May God bless you!

630
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,600
I think he'll just put this right because sensitivity will increase.

631
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,240
Come and sit here. Yes, just go that side.

632
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,560
Are you all right? How are you feeling?

633
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,760
Isn't that his hands started to colour little more too, Mother?

634
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,480
The other it started going a little.

635
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,080
I think put his left hand on the Mother Earth.

636
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,080
All right? Just like that. Press it on the Mother Earth.

637
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,680
Tell him to put it on the Mother Earth.

638
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,480
On the ground?

639
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,040
On the ground.[You are not cheated?] Now.

640
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
No need to lock up...

641
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
Don't lock up your this thing, you see.

642
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
He said, he feels it more comfortable.

643
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,240
Is it? O.k.

644
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,480
Better? Is he better now?

645
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,520
I can feel very little Mother.

646
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,320
You didn't feel that much? All right! Come along, let's try!

647
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,080
Someone here to work on this lady?

648
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Just this lady here. Now come along. I would like to work on you.

649
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
It's better now?

650
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Is it cooling down?

651
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,360
What he is saying?

652
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,120
You have pain in your back?

653
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,200
All the time?

654
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,720
- Always? - Sometimes I [unclear] sometime [unclear].

655
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,440
So most of the time, nearly all the time.

656
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,560
Where about is it? This is the point?

657
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,000
It's in the heart, the heart area, there.

658
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,520
Not down below? -Yes.-

659
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,000
And down below? Oh, both at the bottom hand...

660
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,680
Both at swadhistan and at atma.

661
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,480
Very warm hand. Y: Physical sort of... Swadhisthan is felt.

662
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,080
You just go on saying, "Mother, I'm my own guru".

663
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,760
Or "I'm my own master". All right?

664
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,360
You are your own master.

665
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,720
"I am my own master".

666
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,920
You never felt anything yesterday? - No. - Nothing?

667
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,760
Just say that now in your heart. Just quietly in your heart you say.

668
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,640
- Tu parles le francais? - No. I am own master.

669
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,880
- I am my own master. - I am my own master.

670
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,840
I am my own master.

671
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,080
What work you do?

672
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,680
House work. House work.

673
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,520
House work? Work very hard!

674
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,640
You are doing everything. Expert.

675
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
So getting cool?

676
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,920
Is she hot?

677
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,760
Better?

678
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,840
O.k. Go back and you just sit on the ground

679
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,560
with that hand like this. Like same position.

680
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,560
Any position that you want to take.

681
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,160
Let him take another position. I think it will be better off.

682
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,960
No, I mean, for the left hand to You and the right on the ground.

683
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,640
Sitting down, you can sit the other way round.

684
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,760
Sit more correctly. O.k., come with me.

685
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
Whichever way you want to sit.

686
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,240
Let him stand up up[wise].

687
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,080
Maybe if you stand. Stand like this.

688
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,200
Better now? Is it cooler? Are you feeling?

689
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,120
Plan too much of housewife's job, do you?

690
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,400
I know all your keys, eh?

691
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,880
The mother has to know, isn't it?

692
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,280
All right? Is better now? See, it's a screw here.

693
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,960
That gets loose if you plan too much.

694
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,760
You have to fix up the screw.

695
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,280
You try to plan too much. How can you plan?

696
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,640
You see, in a housewife's job I don't think you can plan,

697
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,480
but whatever is available in the market that's all you can cook.

698
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,000
How can you plan before hand?

699
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,640
If you plan and if it is not there, then it's headache.

700
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,600
All right? Better?

701
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,960
Are you feeling anything? Close your eyes!

702
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,040
Do you feel anything?

703
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,800
-Yes.-  Sahasrara.

704
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,760
Better?

705
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,160
Now, are you feeling anything in the hand?

706
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,600
Let Me see. All right. Now, you forgive.

707
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,040
Forgive everyone. Just forgive, your husband, everyone!

708
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,040
And yourself also. Try to forgive.

709
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,280
Better still.

710
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,760
[unclear-All the time it's getting cooler.]

711
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,480
Better.

712
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,120
It's much cooler.

713
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,760
Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand

714
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,600
on the Mother Earth, just touching touching the Mother Earth, there.

715
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,440
All right. Better?

716
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Are you feeling anything or not?

717
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,720
Nothing? Little bit?

718
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,480
Just don't think and forgive. Forgive. Forgive. Forgive.

719
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,280
Forgive. Forgive. Forgive. Forgive.

720
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,840
Just forgive. Forgive.

721
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,920
Better? Feeling more? That means you are not forgiving, that's why

722
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,400
you are not feeling so much. Now go on forgiving. All right? Better.

723
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,400
Sit down and say "I forgive everyone". Just sit down and say.

724
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,600
May God bless you!

725
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:48,960
Now, you can come forward now. Let's see. You try on her.

726
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,960
- You? - That's her husband, Mother.

727
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,640
Oh, I see, your husband. Now, then you come. Now, let's...

728
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,760
Is he all right?

729
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,760
I don't think I'm very sensitive.

730
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,760
Not yet? Not feeling anything?

731
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,640
Sometimes I used to feel a burning sensation here.

732
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,800
- It will work out. - Pardon?

733
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,360
It will work out.

734
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,320
Say more.

735
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,000
What work you do? Housewife?

736
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,320
Unemployed.

737
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,640
But you must be a housewife?

738
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,800
A clerk.

739
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,960
Works in... clerical work, Mother.

740
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,960
Warm. You've been to some gurus? Have you been?

741
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,000
- Yogiji. - Who's Yogiji?

742
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,640
In Dharamsala school.

743
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,880
Yogi Mahajan.

744
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Yogi Mahajan?

745
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,080
Oh, I see!

746
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,760
He never corrected your Nabhi, yes?

747
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,440
All right. Come forward. And I have to correct your Nabhi.

748
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,960
Is very hot! All right.

749
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,080
Just come forward!  It's too much on the Nabhi.

750
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
Just left hand.

751
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,920
Is it possible? Can we remove this part?

752
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,960
Let her put her hand on the Mother Earth. Now it's all right.

753
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,080
Now, what about these people?

754
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,920
I think I feel burning just here.

755
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,560
Just here. All right! Can somebody help her?

756
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,240
Anybody coming down ?

757
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,360
Now, you see, the thing is we have...

758
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,960
Is it to be?... It doesn't relay, does it?

759
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,080
No, it doesn't, Mother, I'm afraid.

760
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,280
We are now like travellers, come down here, you see,

761
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,400
with all our caravan. And we'll be going away...

762
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,360
But it would be good for you to start a centre in Perth, you see.

763
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,640
-In  Adelaide. - I'm sorry, I mean Adelaide!

764
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,280
Perth was last couple of days ago.

765
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,600
I've been talking too much.

766
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,080
So in Adelaide. In Adelaide...

767
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,440
maybe that some people would like to come down here,

768
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,960
and take a place on hire, to begin with.

769
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,920
And if some of you could join them also, to stay with them,

770
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,760
you can build up a nucleus to begin with.

771
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,600
Then gradually, as you grow more, then you can establish your own

772
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,920
proper thing. To begin with, I think best thing would be

773
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,560
to take some place on hire

774
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,680
and some of them can come down here.

775
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,680
And some of you who are alone can also stay there

776
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,520
and pay for your rents together, I don't want anything.

777
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,440
All right? Look after yourselves

778
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,400
and also look after this place.

779
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,440
This is what we are planning to do.

780
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,720
But all those who belong to Adelaide should help this thing,

781
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
to work out. All right?

782
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,720
So, if you know of any place which is spacious enough,

783
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,320
please let us know and not so much rent, because

784
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,760
everybody doesn't have so much money.

785
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,400
And also,

786
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,720
if some of you would like to stay with other Sahaja Yogis,

787
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,280
so that you can all learn,

788
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,560
there could be a regular place for you where you can go and meet.

789
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,840
Because it's quite a lot to be learned and enjoyed in Sahaja Yoga.

790
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Better?

791
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,360
I was just talking about

792
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,480
here in Adelaide we are trying to open a centre here

793
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,560
and if anybody has any ideas,

794
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,760
where there might be a large and appropriate house for renting,

795
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,760
then it would be a good idea to let us know.

796
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,720
Better now? Is she? Are you feeling better?

797
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,880
He suffered from stomach?

798
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,360
-...to Adelaide here perhaps to help

799
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,720
from other centres to get it set up

800
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,400
and those people who might like to join and live with the,

801
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,360
for a time perhaps, with the Sahaja Yogis, join in,

802
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,680
paying rent, living with the other Sahaja Yogis

803
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,760
living with one another, starting to help

804
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,080
spread, starting to talk to other people

805
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:39,920
This is the way Sahaja Yoga has grown in other centres in Australia.

806
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,040
And there's about, I suppose about

807
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,520
sixty people,

808
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,720
who live together in Sidney in various places,

809
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,200
Sahaja Yogis who share a life together there.

810
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,960
And same in Melbourne.

811
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,200
And now, it's now as we start a centre here,

812
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,080
so if anybody has any ideas

813
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,520
where this might be established, this might be got please let us know.

814
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,320
Do you feel better?

815
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,320
Is she better now? Feeling the cool breeze?

816
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,720
...getting to know what Sahaja Yoga is all about

817
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,440
and going to know each other.

818
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,080
Now, how are you? Gets trouble.

819
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,000
I've got schizophrenia.

820
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,640
And how?

821
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,280
I'm on medication.

822
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,080
What schizophrenia? You don't have any. Who told you that?

823
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,880
Doctor.

824
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,480
What do you do for that?

825
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,960
In what way?

826
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,880
What is the symptom you have?

827
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,760
Feeling [to my hands these days] sort of powers, [unclear] powers.

828
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,840
Powers? What powers?

829
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,680
-Devils' powers.-  Really?

830
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,400
Not anymore, because of medication it's got really better.

831
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,800
Powers of the devils?

832
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,400
Yes.

833
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,080
In my left side. In my left side.

834
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,440
Up and down in my left side.

835
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,760
And now in hands [unclear] responsible to...

836
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,720
So they used to overpower you.

837
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,880
Or you used to become violent?

838
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,480
I don't know what I [unclear] a violent, terrible, aggressive mood.

839
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,320
She is still violent, she gives me this black eye.

840
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,200
And you don't know what you are doing?

841
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,880
I don't know. I just now, I need to be cured, that's all.

842
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,240
Now where did you? Did you go to any guru or anyone?

843
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,720
I've taken drugs. LSD, and now I'm [unclear].

844
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,640
And what else?

845
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,400
You went to some guru?

846
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,920
Yes. A psychic healer,

847
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:59,520
he said I had [gangalinie] I had snakes above my head [unclear].

848
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,560
Now, but any other Indian guru you have been to?

849
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,480
No.

850
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,800
How did you sleep last night?

851
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,680
Not very well. I woke up few times, very tensed.

852
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,680
Feels tensed.

853
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,320
No, let her sit down there.

854
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,480
Put her left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

855
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,080
All right?

856
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,000
That left side towards Me.

857
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,080
Now yesterday they told Me that

858
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,280
some Lang gentleman has written a book

859
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,200
that you have to become schizophrenic

860
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,440
to become a higher personality.

861
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,960
It's absurd, absolutely absurd.

862
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,960
I don't know. This fellow is the same I hope of that Dr. Lang.

863
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,600
Is it the same of the...

864
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,160
R D Lang.

865
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,160
[unclear] From London?

866
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,400
Horrible fellow!

867
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,160
You read him, is it? Did you read him?

868
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,000
Yea, I did. I thought enlightenment means skizophrenia.

869
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,960
She thought it was enlightenment to be a skizophrenic.

870
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,960
Put your left hand. It's absurd.

871
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,680
You see, these are all demons, I tell you.

872
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,600
These ideas they give to ruin all human beings and all the seekers.

873
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,680
-Because they sound so plausible, Mother.- How?

874
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,960
Sometimes they sound so plausible.

875
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,400
But how? Then use your brains! God will make you mad?

876
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,520
Before giving you the highest?

877
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,080
I tell you how what must have happened. St. Paul,

878
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,600
he's responsible.

879
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,960
Who is, Mother?

880
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,880
The St. Paul in the Bible, you read. Yes is this horrible gentleman.

881
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,600
He was... I don't know how he is there in the Bible.

882
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,480
First of all, because he is the one

883
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,880
who was just killing all the Christians,

884
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,840
he was doing all kind of things, suddenly he saw a cross.

885
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,840
According to Sahaja Yoga it's a supraconscious activity.

886
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,560
Supraconscious.

887
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,480
And in this supraconscious activity you see, you start seeing cross,

888
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,760
you can see even Christ, you can see anything.

889
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,760
Seeing is not the point. Becoming is the point, you see?

890
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,600
And then suddenly he took over to organize Christianity.

891
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,640
And then the way he organized, were all absolutely devilish.

892
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,640
Because what he said, he wrote these acts, acts,

893
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,360
about the disciples of Christ.

894
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,080
He had never met them, he had never seen them. On his own he wrote,

895
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,080
saying that they became mad

896
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,600
and the Holy Ghost came into them, they were talking like mad

897
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,160
and all those things and..

898
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,680
Mother, I went to an... what they call...

899
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,640
Speaking in tongues.

900
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,160
Charismatic.

901
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,160
Charismatic? - Yes, I went to that way.-

902
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,880
That's what they are doing. I mean,

903
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,680
they don't use their brains you see.

904
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,160
Excuse me, Mother. What is this they are "speaking in tongues"?

905
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,560
So then, what happened, that this gentleman

906
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,200
wrote there the Acts. Is one of the chapters in Bible,

907
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,280
in which he described these people,

908
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,760
the disciples of Christ getting Holy Ghost into them.

909
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,800
Holy Ghost making them mad.

910
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,160
And they were talking all kinds of languages,

911
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,280
talking all sorts of things

912
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,280
and that is how the Holy Ghost came in. Imagine.

913
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,520
Is this the way She is going to come? That She makes you mad?

914
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,560
And how can it be? Who wants such a Holy Ghost?

915
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,720
You must understand, it is God,

916
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,480
who is kind, who is gentle, who is our benefactor.

917
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,080
He's beneficent. How can He make us mad?

918
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,600
And all the christians believe that part of Bible.

919
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,520
Is all wrong, absolutely!

920
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,520
You must have seen, when people get posessed,

921
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,960
they start talking all kinds of languages.

922
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:26,960
Even, you must have seen a film on this artist...

923
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,560
What was it?  Van Gogh, Van Gogh!

924
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,480
The one who became mad and died. Van Gogh.

925
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,840
They showed Van Gogh coming into some person

926
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,760
and drawing the whole thing just like him,

927
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,600
and also painting the same way, the way... You know Van Gogh's

928
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,640
paintings are. There's very strong lines of different colours.

929
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,400
Same style he did, in a free hand he did it.

930
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,400
And he said that "Van Gogh has come into my body."

931
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,000
So, this is not what you have to get from God.

932
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,880
It's something so great and so important!

933
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,120
Not these cheap things, like talking in another language...

934
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,960
Now take out your rings, all right? Please. Take out all of them.

935
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,960
It's not proper to wear rings too many.

936
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,280
That's what my mum says.

937
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,720
Your mum gave it. All right.

938
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,840
You put them in the water for the time being. All right?

939
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,840
Take out all of them. Take out.

940
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,160
Oh, better, he's all right! Are you all right?

941
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,440
It should be logical, you know? Everything. This particular....

942
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,560
-It's wedding ring.-  Wedding it's all right.

943
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,960
Put your right hand like this.

944
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,040
Do their drunkenness....

945
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,560
I beg your pardon?

946
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,680
Drunkenness, Mother, he's asking about.

947
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,680
It is absolutely cleared out, in no time.

948
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,960
Like drugs.

949
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,760
You bring some water for Me, today? Bring water.

950
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,520
I'll vibrate it. You take that. Put it in your alcohols.

951
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,400
Whenever you feel like drinking, you see, just think of Me.

952
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,400
Mother, Australian society expects the male

953
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,160
to go out and drink with the boys fifteen pints every day

954
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,040
and is part of being a man in Australian culture.

955
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
That's the image that they expect of a man.

956
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,320
And because he doesn't do it, he thinks for that, you know,

957
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,960
"Am I a gay or am I a poof, or something like that?"

958
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,920
Because he doesn't do that, you know?

959
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,840
Because he doesn't go out drinking.

960
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,440
You see what happens, that...- He has to drink every day.-

961
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,160
No, but after Realization, means now you have your second birth,

962
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,560
So you are not born in Australia, you are born

963
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,440
in the Kingdom of God.

964
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,800
All right? So you are no more an Australian, you are a yogi.

965
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,120
The whole thing that you get out of your birth is finished now.

966
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,920
No more, you are a Yogi!

967
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,200
All over the world there are so many like that. They are all Yogis!

968
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,160
So these images may be for people who are not reborn.

969
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,400
But people who are reborn, are born in the Kingdom of God.

970
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,120
They are governed by the God's wishes

971
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,120
and God's laws, all right?

972
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,280
Take out your rings also, please.

973
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,400
Is he better?

974
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,200
Not feeling anything? Did you feel before?

975
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,760
Now put your left hand on the liver.

976
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,360
All right? Better now?

977
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,400
Where is he catching?

978
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,520
Left Vishuddhi. I have a left Vishuddhi and little bit Swadhisthan.

979
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,120
As a punishment for feeling guilty!

980
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,440
Keep your eyes open here.

981
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,480
This is a punishment for feeling guilty, all right?

982
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,400
Better. What's it?

983
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,160
It stopped shaking.

984
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,040
Put your right on the Mother Earth.

985
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,560
Let her put her right on the Mother Earth.

986
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,040
Right on the Mother Earth.

987
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,280
And hold this hand up to Mother.

988
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,160
Better? All right? This punishment helps!

989
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,040
Better now? Not yet?

990
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:02,480
Still on the heart. All right.

991
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,960
Better ask the question of Holy Ghost.

992
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,640
"Are you the Holy Ghost?"

993
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,720
Cold.

994
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,520
Yes, I feel there cool.

995
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,360
That's the answer. All right? Good!

996
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,600
Now let him also ask the same question.

997
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,960
"Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?" SM: Again!

998
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,400
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

999
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,480
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

1000
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:04,120
"Mother are you the Holy Ghost?" I feel cool!

1001
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,080
Cool means truth, right?

1002
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,520
Good. Same, you too ask the question.

1003
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:16,800
"Mother, are You the Holy Ghost? Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?"

1004
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,720
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

1005
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,800
All right?

1006
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
It's better!

1007
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:36,640
All right?

1008
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,760
All right now? Nothing? All right, we have to see you.

1009
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,360
Good! Forget about everything now!

1010
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,760
Past is past, finished!

1011
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,560
You are a new born person. May God bless you! Better now?

1012
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,880
Thank you, Mother!

1013
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,720
May God bless you! Now you have to progress further

1014
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,520
and give up all your drugs and everything, after some time.

1015
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,280
You will be perfectly all right. Good.

1016
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,320
Tie it up yourself there, on top.

1017
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,720
Tie it up and knot it.

1018
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,320
We'll do it again.

1019
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,960
Twice.

1020
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,960
Bandhans Mother, as well?

1021
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,600
Good. We'll tell him. Now.

1022
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,160
Let us see two other people.

1023
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,880
-This lady.- This gentleman also, we should see.

1024
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,080
Still here. Come along forward little bit.

1025
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,840
You come along, here. Come forward little bit.

1026
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,760
Come forward [unclear].

1027
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,600
I remember.

1028
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,560
After lifting the energy, after lifting the Kundalini

1029
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,280
like this, you start feeling [unclear].

1030
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,680
And there is the bandhan, which is [unclear].

1031
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,760
Better? Still here.

1032
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,760
Very tough.

1033
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,280
Around you is like a protective shield.

1034
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,800
Seven. Seven is a good auspicious number.

1035
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,040
Herbert?

1036
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,680
Can you, can you light this for Me, please?

1037
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,280
Bandhan is very useful, any time, any time you need.

1038
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,560
So, how did you feel? - Cooler.-

1039
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,920
Cooler, yes,(-Cool breeze-),  all right, let's see.

1040
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,560
What about this lady?

1041
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,520
Is she Australian?

1042
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,720
Also half Indian?

1043
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,600
No Mother, half Mediteranean, not Australian.

1044
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,280
Half-Mediteranean, Mother. Egypt.

1045
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,800
Egyptian. Egypt? Egypt is very good.

1046
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,240
So.

1047
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,440
Good? Better?

1048
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,720
You have a liver problem, sir. A very bad one. Sure?

1049
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,800
You have. All right.

1050
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,040
Now you sit down there and put your right hand towards Me

1051
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,240
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

1052
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,240
You too! You have a bad liver. Do you know that?

1053
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,320
All right. You put your right hand towards Me

1054
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,480
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

1055
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,640
Right hand towards Me, like this

1056
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,480
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

1057
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,320
He's all right. Y:Just put your two hands towards Mother.

1058
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,400
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

1059
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,760
A little cooler.

1060
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,640
Little cooler.

1061
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,640
Close your eyes! Let's see.

1062
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,200
Still shaking, Mother.

1063
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,320
The Hamsa.

1064
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,320
Better?

1065
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:41,760
You put your left hand on the earth and right hand towards Me.

1066
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,880
Have you sun tanned yourself or what?

1067
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,480
You don't do that, not good!

1068
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:00,320
Very bad for your liver, very bad for your skin.

1069
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,160
And in the long run it's very, very bad.

1070
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,960
It can create very serious problem. All right? There's no need!

1071
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,960
You look nice without it, isn't it?

1072
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,040
I'm surprised, that they talk of racialism

1073
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,440
and they don't like people who are black.

1074
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,640
And here they are making themselves black.

1075
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,560
How do you explain this? Isn't it absurd?

1076
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,600
It is very absurd this discrimination against black people.

1077
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,040
Everybody trying to be black, then, why?

1078
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,560
Either you have this or that.

1079
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,720
Don't think about too much. Just, just feel it, just.

1080
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,960
It's a little bit warm there, that's what he's saying,

1081
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,960
it's a little bit warm there but it's cool there.

1082
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,840
So if you feel the difference, means [unclear].

1083
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,080
Is she that tensed?

1084
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,640
Is it not all right? I think he is all right. This one is all right.

1085
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,720
Better now?

1086
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,240
[unclear]

1087
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,040
How is she?

1088
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,440
I think she is all right. She's all right. You look after her.

1089
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,040
It's better. Now you sit down. Now better?

1090
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,640
This gentleman, left to the right, just put it.

1091
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,840
Are you better now? Sit down properly.

1092
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,560
Sit down. The same way as you have been sitting. How is she?

1093
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,200
I'm just anxious.

1094
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,320
And yesterday you felt the cool breeze?

1095
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,960
I was feeling a lot of heat in the hands.

1096
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,680
A lot of heat in the right hand and

1097
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,720
a bit of shaking on the right, Mother.

1098
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,640
Now put your left hand on the [Mother Earth]. Yes, outside, yes.

1099
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,200
What work do you do?

1100
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,040
Teacher.

1101
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,520
Better ask the question.

1102
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,720
She's a teacher.

1103
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,760
"Mother, are You the teacher of the teachers?"

1104
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,680
Just ask the question, "Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1105
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,440
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1106
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,120
Put your hand there, on the Mother Earth. It's important.

1107
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,600
Ask the question?

1108
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,960
"Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1109
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,200
Again. "Mother...

1110
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,840
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1111
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,040
"Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1112
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,800
Getting?

1113
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,400
This is [unclear] impossible, Mother.

1114
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,960
Is there? Now ask ten times, so that it's clearer.

1115
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,920
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1116
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,520
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

1117
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:15,000
All right? That's the answer.

1118
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,680
Ask. It's all right. It's done, it's flowing.

1119
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,280
Close your eyes!

1120
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,960
Forgive. Forgive all the students, first of all.

1121
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,280
That's what I'm caring for.

1122
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,640
Just forgive them! They are good.

1123
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,080
I have a knot in my stomach yet.

1124
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,640
Yes, I know. They can be horrible nuisance.

1125
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,320
Now you see, because parents don't look after their children,

1126
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,200
no training, no discipline,

1127
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,400
they just know how to laugh and mock at the teachers.

1128
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:25,920
Not in India. In India is not so. But otherwise...

1129
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,760
- Thank you! - May God bless you!

1130
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,440
Now you know how important is this work, you see?

1131
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,920
We have to also transform the children,

1132
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:41,800
so they become good, happy children, secured,

1133
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:46,320
feeling the love of God. See, they will improve a lot.

1134
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,520
All right? May God bless you!

1135
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,200
This lady, how is she?

1136
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,400
Just see! Come along!

1137
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,880
This one is all right? He's good!

1138
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,280
He's really good. You didn't go to any guru, anyone?

1139
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,280
No, not really, no. I've done some reading.

1140
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:13,400
SM: Reading only. Y: No, not seeing, not visiting any ashrams.

1141
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,400
Thank God.

1142
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,400
Otherwise I have to clear everyone...

1143
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,280
Now, you've been to someone?

1144
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,120
He's been to Yogi Mahajan too.

1145
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:33,400
Yes? And who else? - Nobody else is.-

1146
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,080
Only Yogi Mahajan?! Yogi Mahajan is giving Me problem.

1147
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,840
He did all kinds of things, Yogi, to begin with. Now, you can...

1148
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,440
He did all kinds of other things. When did you go to Yogi Mahajan?

1149
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,960
Before or after he got his Realization?

1150
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,680
When did you go to him?

1151
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,920
About two years ago, Mother.

1152
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,200
Did he talk of Sahaja Yoga at that time?

1153
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,040
Background is Egyptian.

1154
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,160
Background is Egyptian, Mother. About half and half.

1155
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,640
How is it?

1156
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,440
Now which guru you have been to? Somebody, did you go?  No one.

1157
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,120
The Egyptians believe in the mummies and all that.

1158
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,600
I'm Jewish by religion, Jewish.

1159
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,800
That's it!

1160
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,320
For Jews you have to ask one question, all right, if you don't mind.

1161
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,240
Say "Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

1162
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,120
Touché.

1163
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,840
All right, just ask Me! In asking there is no harm!

1164
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,480
All right? If I am the truth you will know it.

1165
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,760
All right? Let's have it's answer.

1166
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,120
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

1167
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,280
All right, just put it up. Again!

1168
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,000
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

1169
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,280
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

1170
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,480
All right. Got it.

1171
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,200
All right? Feeling the cool in the hands?

1172
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,640
I say what does it matter.

1173
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,840
Is it coming in the hand?

1174
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,960
I don't know what I'm supposed to feel.

1175
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,680
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hands?

1176
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,440
No, I'm feeling a concentration of heat

1177
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,440
in the centre of both the palms.

1178
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,960
Very sharp concentration.

1179
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,960
You have to believe in Christ. He was!

1180
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,120
You can't help it! You can't deny the truth. He was!

1181
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,600
See, Jews said, didn't deny him because they believed

1182
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,040
that "we must suffer", alright?

1183
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,280
So they did suffer. Now at least, believe in Him!

1184
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,280
I believe in suffering.

1185
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,320
Still? Then you'll have another Hitler.

1186
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,400
You want another Hitler to come in?

1187
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,040
I think every Jew is his own Hitler.

1188
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,360
That's it. So what? Don't be against yourself.

1189
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,320
God has made you to be happy, not to suffer.

1190
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,680
Wrong ideas about God. Absolutely wrong ideas.

1191
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,480
It's very, very wrong ideas you have. How can God make you suffer?

1192
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,760
I don't know how these ideas came to you.

1193
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,680
It's like it's burning! [unclear].

1194
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,720
Now you want to suffer, so the burning is there.

1195
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,760
Now just say: "I don't want to suffer Mother, anymore!"

1196
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,760
I don't want to suffer anymore.

1197
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,240
Again, Say that.

1198
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,040
"I don't want to suffer anymore."

1199
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,200
"Mother, I don't want to suffer anymore."

1200
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,600
"Mother, I don't want to suffer anymore."

1201
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:59,240
Better, you see? Is cooler now?

1202
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,560
Better?

1203
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,400
This one is very, very hot.

1204
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,920
Just see. You can see clear, the truth, before yourself.

1205
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,520
See, that you should feel such heat.

1206
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,960
This is anti-God activity to ask for suffering.

1207
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,960
Supposing you have a mother or you are a mother

1208
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,480
and if your child says: "Oh, I want to suffer."

1209
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,400
It's too much for a mother to see the child suffering.

1210
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,040
Greater suffering than the child has.

1211
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,120
It's some sort of a sadism, I think, to torture God.

1212
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,120
Isn't it? Why should you suffer?

1213
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,880
It's absurd! God will never like you to suffer.

1214
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:58,360
Why will He? He was not created you on this earth to suffer.

1215
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,800
Did you suffer to become human beings?

1216
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,720
No, I did not, at all. Then why should you suffer now?

1217
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,080
It's all mental activity.

1218
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,920
Something you must find out to hit yourself, isn't it?

1219
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,800
All right. Better.

1220
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,200
Have faith in yourself.

1221
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,240
The whole of Bible, if you read,

1222
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,000
I don't find anywhere written, that you must suffer.

1223
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,840
You feel like cool in hand now?

1224
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,760
Oh, it's there.

1225
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,640
What about the Son?

1226
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:43,160
"Thou art my shepherd." That's in the Bible.

1227
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,600
"The Lord is my shepherd."

1228
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,760
That's in the Tora. Then how?

1229
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,560
What did David say?

1230
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,440
Did he say "I want to suffer"?

1231
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,800
From where did these Jews get this idea?

1232
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,560
It's very bad! Makes God suffer much more.

1233
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,280
All right?

1234
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,560
-It's quite a lot of Vishuddhi here, Mother.-  Too much.

1235
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,920
- Especially on the left.-

1236
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,560
Now don't feel guilty, for asking for suffering.

1237
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,720
Now don't feel guilty.

1238
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,520
All right. How are you? Are you also a Jew?

1239
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,520
[unclear]

1240
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,480
Now, we have many Jews who are yogis, you see?

1241
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,520
We have many Jews who are yogis.

1242
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,800
They've lost all that.

1243
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,680
And then what happened later on, see, they suffered.

1244
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,560
But the suffering did not transform the Jews. Just see that!

1245
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,960
If after all that exodus and all those problems they had

1246
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,400
they became more cruel people.

1247
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,040
How they behave now? Recently you saw them? Where they killed.

1248
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,920
There's no transformation. This suffering has given them

1249
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,880
a condition which is very volatile and extremely violent.

1250
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,920
And the reaction.

1251
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,400
Instead of making them peaceful people,

1252
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,880
kind people, compassionate people, isn't it?

1253
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,960
How they behaved?

1254
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,440
There's no transformation through this suffering.

1255
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,920
On the contrary, it's very dangerous to suffer.

1256
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,560
Those who suffer become reactionaries.

1257
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,880
And bitter.

1258
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,560
Ah, better. - It's good!-

1259
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,560
Come forward! Now, are you a Jew?

1260
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,080
So what are you? - Nothing. - Nothing.

1261
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,080
How do you all get these claws? - Because of the machines.-

1262
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,400
Now, better.

1263
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,120
Close your eyes!

1264
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,400
10% in this country, Mother.

1265
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,200
And rising, somebody says.

1266
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:38,120
Your forefathers have worked for you. This kind for you I think.

1267
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,880
How is she?

1268
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,440
There's a little Nabhi, it shows.

1269
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:01,200
Little yellow on the hands as well.

1270
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,840
What work you do? - I'm a teacher.-

1271
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:14,480
Let her put left hand on her stomach. Ask her.

1272
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:19,480
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?" Yes?

1273
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,320
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

1274
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,400
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

1275
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,520
Say it again! Say, ten times you have to say!

1276
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:45,040
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

1277
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,080
All right?

1278
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,960
Better. Do you [unclear]?

1279
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,520
Little in the hand?

1280
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,400
To the right? Twice try it.

1281
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,400
Put your left hand.

1282
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,600
It's all right? Forgive, just forgive.

1283
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,960
Warren? Just see this gentleman!
