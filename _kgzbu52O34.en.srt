1
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:56,990
Very nice to see you all here for Easter Puja. Very nice. Such a pleasure, such a joy

2
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,050
As if I feel the resurrection working fast

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
The year

4
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,060
1990 has come now

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
as a special year for all of us

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,830
Sahaja Yoga is going to spread very fast, no doubt,

7
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,300
everywhere,

8
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
all over the world, I know that

9
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,090
It has to spread

10
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,850
And

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,300
also I told you that a new

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,580
jump has to be taken by all the Sahaja Yogis

13
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
To explain it

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,789
we'll say that Sahaja Yoga is spreading in a horizontal manner

15
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,110
The plane is horizontal and you are responsible for that work

16
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,470
You are working it out, no doubt

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,030
Because of you it has spread

18
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Some of you have gone all out

19
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,200
to work it out, to spread it to villages, to surrounding places, different countries

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,020
Also the events,

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,330
world events, have helped us a lot and

22
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,800
Sahaja Yoga has worked

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,770
in a very big way. Maybe it will be difficult for us to

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
really balance it out

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
But

26
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,790
when we move horizontally

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,480
we must also know

28
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,540
that we have to move

29
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,870
vertically

30
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,570
Otherwise,

31
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
what would happen

32
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,480
is that we lose in quality

33
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,570
Quantity maybe quite a lot but we'll lack in quality

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
And if the quality goes down

35
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,529
then you will see many will fritter away

36
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,670
So we have to look after

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,290
our vertical ascent which is very important

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,750
If I tell you some of the things that have happened  in this short time after I left India

39
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm  myself amazed that

40
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,309
in geometrical proportions, Sahaja Yoga is rising very hard

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,740
But that should not be complete satisfaction

42
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,059
Individually also we have to rise. And every one of you has to rise

43
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,980
Vertical ascent has to be achieved by all of you

44
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,850
Some might have lost a little bit,  some might have

45
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,850
been a little bit

46
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,049
away from

47
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,580
themselves

48
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,359
The attention might have frittered away quite a lot

49
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,230
but we have to know why we are here

50
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,430
and then it's very easy

51
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,579
We are here to be part and parcel of a very good very great revolution

52
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,959
Can you imagine that we are transforming human beings, it was never possible

53
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:56,229
A-mass transformation is going to take place that is how this world is going to change and you are part and parcel of that

54
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,710
but when you become part and parcel of that

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
you just forget sometimes

56
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,320
that we have many things which are trying to pull us down

57
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,039
So we are happy to see the spread of Sahaja Yoga, but we don't see vertically what we are losing

58
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,750
and

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:25,299
that I think is a greater loss, doesn't matter if there are two persons less or more. What is important is that

60
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,030
we should have

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
very deep Sahaja Yogis

62
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,479
otherwise Sahaja Yoga will fritter away

63
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,059
So many events are going to happen

64
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
we are on the stage

65
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,739
and we have to cooperate and coordinate and understand

66
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,039
See now for example to come here

67
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,019
David had a problem. He said, mother, it's just like a tempest, it's horrible

68
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,680
I was there a week back and he was quite upset about it

69
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,419
Everybody told me about this place, I said, all right let's see

70
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,959
and yesterday also I'm told it was raining but in Cambridge it was terrible

71
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,320
and I said, the wind will start and wind will blow on the wind

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,190
all the clouds were blown out

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,799
and there was clear sky, so the wind has started in a way and you can see it

74
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,840
but you must have your feet on the grounds

75
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,119
and this is what I find you people don't realize sometimes

76
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,229
what an important work you are doing

77
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,609
I mean what an important position you are and

78
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,229
and what?

79
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,229
an

80
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
achievement

81
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,169
you are going to have yourself

82
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,370
and what a

83
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,919
great boon you are going to bestow upon human beings

84
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,029
So when we come out of family life for example

85
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,139
we have come to Sahaja Yoga

86
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,259
giving up all these things

87
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:50,759
giving up all these mundane things, clothes, this that, house, a car

88
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:59,909
then family life, relationships, everything. We came here to seek truth and to be one with God

89
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,738
Not that you have to sort of

90
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,199
take to sanyaasa

91
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,038
but given up means you are detached

92
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,059
and you are attached to one principle that you have to achieve

93
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,149
Godliness within you

94
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,879
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga

95
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:32,698
I've seen the beauty of Sahaja Yoga, then again you want to go back

96
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,539
to those useless things

97
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,549
then you cannot explain why it happens like that

98
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,649
Like somebody gets married he gets lost with his wife

99
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,909
He gets a house, he gets lost with the house

100
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,569
He gets a car, he gets lost with the car

101
00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:01,078
He gets a job, he gets lost with the job. He gets a factory, he gets money, he gets lost

102
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,370
So what have you given up?

103
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,750
The detachment is not there

104
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,650
When you have known there is no joy now in all these things, that's why you have come to Sahaja Yoga

105
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,429
Joy is in one thing is

106
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,369
to be connected to the Divine Power

107
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,639
Not to all these things, these are not important

108
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,550
or

109
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,090
you didn't come here out of hypocrisy or

110
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,140
you didn't come here for any gains

111
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
of a mean quality

112
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
You came for a very

113
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,309
precious thing, something of supreme value;

114
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,020
giving up all that is so useless

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,509
You are among them, you are there, but if you get attached to it again

116
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,540
then you lose lots of your energy and mine too

117
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,459
So the detachment that you had developed before coming to Sahaja Yoga

118
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,289
should be there. But what I find, once they get into Sahaja Yoga,

119
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,339
,they get a job, "Now I'm busy with my job. I can't do anything else"

120
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,489
Another will say, "I have a school to attend to". "I have got my children". Somebody will say, "It's my wife"

121
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,259
Then some becomes very romantic,they fall in love. All kinds of nonsense they do

122
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,359
When you have come in the boat, how can you jump back?

123
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,679
So it's very important to understand

124
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,639
that we are Sahaja Yogis

125
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:06,149
Nothing can attract us,

126
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,250
nothing can deter us, nothing can take away our attention

127
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:13,949
but one thing

128
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,919
that we are here for the emancipation of human

129
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,810
beings and that our own character, our own style, our own personality is going to change it

130
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,839
I'll give an example of that

131
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,269
When I was going

132
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:35,459
to Russia for the second time in the family they said, "You have been already there,

133
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:36,449
why do you want to go again,

134
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:41,909
after all, you've been there first and again you want to go for two three days. I mean a yoga

135
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,589
seminar can be looked after by other people who are there". I said, "No I have to go"

136
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,709
But they insisted and then I said, "You see I have a plan

137
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,699
that if I go there,

138
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,949
there will be lots of people from all these countries which are called as Eastern Bloc

139
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,829
and I think I can break it

140
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:10,349
through Sahaja Yogis, if they get their realization. I was just saying that we should get really some remarkable people to come

141
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,909
and they gave merely 45 minutes to speak to them

142
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,230
I spoke for about 35 minutes, I should say, or 32 minutes

143
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,470
and I then gave them Realization

144
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,089
Tremendous people, tremendous personality I touched

145
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,320
When I went out they all walked with me, nobody was there in the hall

146
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,649
to listen to anybody else. The whole seminar was over

147
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:41,639
And they gave me their address, they gave me their phone number, everything. And they were after me and

148
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,069
I had no paper, pencil; somebody was writing it

149
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,698
And I was very satisfied

150
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,219
I could see clearly in their personality that they are very deep people

151
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,179
As soon as they went back, the Paramchaitanya

152
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,410
triggered it

153
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,250
and you know what happened with the Eastern Bloc

154
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,609
Tremendous people there are, they are tremendous people

155
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,269
Russians are tremendous and these people are tremendous. Very high quality seekers

156
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Same about

157
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,079
Hungary. Everybody were saying, "what about Hungary, Mother?" before that. I said," let one come from there"

158
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,649
And really one came quite sick, you know, thinned out sick person

159
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,039
He got his realization and here it is, Hungary is free. Same with Romania

160
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,760
So what is the difference in quality that we are supposed to become people from three countries,

161
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,090
and those who were in the shackles of

162
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,940
communism

163
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,789
I don't know, but maybe

164
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,059
they must have been great people to be born there perhaps

165
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,499
Because Lenin talked of stateless state and things like that, but I don't know what

166
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,210
to say. But

167
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,090
one thing for definite is they had no time to waste their attention here and there

168
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,430
No nonsenses of religion, no nonsenses of conditioning, no nonsenses of

169
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,659
all kinds of theories, no nonsenses of becoming hippies and no nonsenses of

170
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,670
becoming these punks and this and that and all sorts of nonsense

171
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Nothing

172
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,080
Of course I don't say that when I went there I found people - at least 25% who were who are asking for

173
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,769
American jeans, but that's different- only 25%

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
But the rest of them,

175
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,859
just clean plates, absolutely clean plates

176
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,010
Very nicely combed their hair with oil and all that, very smart people

177
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,640
No inhibitions of asking me about themselves and

178
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:31,169
nothing of the kind. No hypocrisy, nothing. No fashions. No fashions

179
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,289
Very straightforward, simple, educated, dignified people

180
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,739
Nobody walking with funny gestures or anything, very dignified

181
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
They were supposed to be people

182
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,490
in the shackles of communism

183
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
And one person has written

184
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:05,169
the mathematical calculation of Shri Chakra and he very humbly came to me,  sat down, to know all about it

185
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,609
Their humility was, I can't explain to you

186
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,519
Even to touch the platform

187
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:15,159
with such humility and discipline they gave

188
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,140
Whatever it is, whatever the regime must have been to them or whatever it is

189
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,810
They are not abundant people

190
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:27,849
It's a kind of a proper discipline of their mind

191
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,610
The mind

192
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,950
is so receptive,

193
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
so humble

194
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,430
In this so-called freedom we have lost quite a lot of ourselves, I think. First of all

195
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,339
experimenting ourselves with all kinds of nonsense;

196
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,290
talking about things that we should not;

197
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,849
seeing things as in the name of freedom, which we should never see, as human beings

198
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,849
Anything people can do in a free country

199
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,549
I think, unless and until you have Realization, freedom has no meaning

200
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,309
because they get abandoned

201
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:21,040
Completely they abandon all their qualities, all their value systems, everything

202
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,039
So we come to a point to understand that we have harmed ourselves,

203
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,339
we have harmed our attentions

204
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,799
First,

205
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,640
one thing,

206
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,910
that in the family system,

207
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,720
the parents used to be cruel and funny and this and that

208
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,270
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis,

209
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,299
so now you are so much attached to your children

210
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,169
that it's also not good

211
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,460
This is my child, this is my wife, this is my house

212
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
How can it be now?

213
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,800
Now you have become a free bird. So,

214
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,479
today is the Easter day as we are celebrating today. And Easter time,

215
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,830
one has to remember that now we are free. We are not eggs anymore

216
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,119
inside the shell. We are now birds

217
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,290
We need not carry the yellow of the egg on our head

218
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,280
to boast about it. Now finished now, that's done

219
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
It's no more there

220
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,530
So why should we go and

221
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,050
try to become eggs again

222
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,530
What's the wisdom?

223
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,640
And then another shocking thing that I have seen is this that,

224
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,949
we have come out of a sense of

225
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,139
we have come out of sense of dominating others,

226
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,440
intimidating others,

227
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,989
making fun of others, hating others, all these bad things that we had

228
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,850
freedom to do

229
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,300
to talk rudely to others, we have freedom you know,

230
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
freedom to hurt

231
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,629
When we have given up all that, then I find that as Sahaja Yogis

232
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
people are still doing it

233
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,350
That role is over

234
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,880
Say now, you were a policeman, but now you have become a priest. I shouldn't say priest, but what should I say then?

235
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,368
They are equally bad! I should say, now you have become a Realized soul

236
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:59,539
So, now when you have become the Realized soul,

237
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:08,089
you are the bird. You are the real free bird, which has got wings, which has got eyes,

238
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,909
which can fly,

239
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,159
which does not have

240
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:19,248
those qualities which you had as eggs. It's completely transformed. It's finished

241
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,618
Its mythical. You cannot become that now

242
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,549
If a bird wants to become an egg, it will suffocate and die

243
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,299
This reverse direction is not possible, but why?

244
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,319
why to be in the reverse direction? you should ask question to ourselves

245
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:50,329
We have to ascend so,

246
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:55,098
in resurrection we have to learn detachment

247
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,979
It's only mental

248
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,319
I mean, I don't know, how can a bird be attached to an egg?

249
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:09,618
It could be attached to an egg thinking, "Oh, how cozy I was, I didn't have to fly"

250
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:17,478
Or something like that could be, you see. I mean only bad things there are to be an egg and to think about an egg

251
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:20,809
But I don't know how it can be attached or. On the contrary it would

252
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,729
abhor that life, "Oh baba,what I was, where I was

253
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,539
In the same way we should also feel

254
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,750
a

255
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,589
kind of glory that we are

256
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:56,569
But there's no vanity in it. It's a Pride.

257
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:58,569
is a

258
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,730
assumption

259
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,730
is a

260
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
acceptance

261
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,059
You are sitting on a throne

262
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,169
Now you cannot enjoy a mud, can you?

263
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,695
So when we reverse back, when our mind goes in a reverse direction,

264
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:24,919
you have to understand that we are slipping out

265
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
That is very important

266
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,449
My experience of Australia was rather saddening because I found that it slipped out completely, all of them

267
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,490
Absolutely

268
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,349
slipped out. The leaders were like jailers and

269
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:49,249
the way they behaved and some of them who joined them and it was like a regime and it's horrible things

270
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,669
hitlerish

271
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,446
So I had to pull them back again onto the boat.

272
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:02,269
I had to work very hard, very very hard with them

273
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,169
This is so-called freedom that we have, that has ruined them

274
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,439
Another miracle took place that I went out

275
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,980
to a place called Cairns

276
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,109
which is a very far fetched place near Equator, at the tip of Australia

277
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:33,230
And they told me that the Great Barrier Reef is very close from here and there are fishes called as

278
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,159
Crown thorn

279
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:39,289
what do we call them Crown thorn

280
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,400
What fishes?

281
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:49,280
starfishes and these are eating all those little little animals that make those beautiful corals there

282
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,549
And that's when the regeneration has stopped from the 10 years. God knows from where they have come, shoals of them and shoals of them

283
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:58,969
I said, "I would like to go and see this Great Barrier Reef, let's see"

284
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,830
So went down, there was a boat which was to sink halfway. And halfway

285
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,910
we were sitting there and watching everything

286
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,929
They said you'll see those fishes there. I saw big big turtles and I saw

287
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
beautiful, very beautiful

288
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,319
fishes of such varieties, such colors, very gently passing

289
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,750
But not a single fish that starfish, not a single

290
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,559
I said,  "let's see, let's see" .So we went round and round quite a lot

291
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,309
Wanted to see one at least, what sort of a thing it is

292
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,470
Went around the whole thing, not a single thing. And this happened on

293
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,589
the 10th I was there. On the 17th we were travelling

294
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,860
in the plane, they announced a miracle has happened that all these fishes have disappeared and

295
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,070
some who were there are dying

296
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
Can you imagine?

297
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:23,829
So what I'm trying to tell you, that you have those eyes, you have that personality

298
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,579
that can trigger all these things

299
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,849
If 2-3 east German Sahaja Yogis who got realization

300
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:47,020
can go and trigger, and the Berlin Wall can fall down,

301
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,749
then with all these Sahaja Yogis I don't know what should happen

302
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,770
That you have, that power you have

303
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,520
That's why I say that vertical improvement has to be there

304
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,890
And then let that power act and trigger

305
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
You all can trigger it

306
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,890
individually and collectively,

307
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,819
but vertical program is less,

308
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,770
vertical understanding is less

309
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,890
Any number of Sahaja Yogis we may have,  but if they cannot trigger, then what's the use

310
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:46,210
So my request is that, we have to now pay attention to our vertical movement,

311
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,270
and to our attention

312
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,370
Same about marriages. I mean sometimes I feel I don't know why I married them, but they get lost

313
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,150
Imagine

314
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,960
I can't understand

315
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:17,090
You marry in Sahaja Yoga, you marry for Sahaja Yoga, you want to have children who are Sahaja Yogis, you want to have

316
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:22,959
Realized souls, you want to support Sahaja Yoga, and that's why you marry and you get lost in marriages

317
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,620
Somebody comes and ask me, "Mother, there's a very nice job I can get". "Alright, may God bless you"

318
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,259
The God blesses him is lost to Sahaja Yoga though

319
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,380
So these temptations

320
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,350
are there because we are not detached?

321
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,960
So on this great day, I have to tell you that now we have become birds

322
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,559
and we don't want to be eggs again by any chance

323
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,949
We're not going to go back to that state

324
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,859
and we have to trigger so many things

325
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,939
You all have come to England, the whole England should be triggered

326
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:09,639
There's another good news I must give you. I went down to Jaipur. Only one gentleman from

327
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,779
Delhi went down to Jaipur to organize

328
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,010
and

329
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:22,270
Jaipur people said, "it is very difficult you see here, this and that". He said, "No, I'll have the program in Govindji's mandir,

330
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,080
where nobody can have programme, "I'll go and see the maharani"

331
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,899
So, maharani would not meet him, he was insisting, sitting there, waiting for her

332
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,870
Ultimately he got a chance. He went and talked to her. He showed her my photograph. Immediately she took to me

333
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,529
She asked about Sahaja Yoga, "What is Sahaja Yoga?" then she said, "give me Realization"

334
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,640
She got Realization, the maharaja got Realization. They said, "Yes, we can have the program here". She said, "I'll come to the program"

335
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,480
She came down herself

336
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,509
She fell at my feet in the public,

337
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,339
sitting there all the time, her husband sitting there and

338
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,920
somebody offered them some water to drink.They said, " how can I?"

339
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,469
She's the goddess, I can't drink before her, she sat there

340
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,400
Imagine, she just got her Realization. What a depth

341
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,109
But that's not enough. They have one festival called Gangaur

342
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,979
That is a thing where they worship Gauri

343
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,890
That's the biggest festival where the queen, maharani, has to worship

344
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:28,800
the Gangauri. It's is a statue which goes round the whole of Jaipur State and everybody celebrates it

345
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,700
It's regarded as the biggest festival. So, she in the morning she came and touched my feet and she said,

346
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:42,989
"Mother, Can I worship you?". I said, "why?" "Because you are my Gangaur, really. That's just a statue

347
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,910
She made me stand the same way. She did everything. She made me eat betel

348
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,229
I don't eat all that, but she said," you have to, you are Gangaur

349
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,479
And she worshiped me and all her whole ritual she did for about 45 minutes and

350
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,109
then she said now I'll go and worship that statue

351
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,709
Nobody's allowed to go there. She took me there, she made me sit in a very nice place, like this decorated

352
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
How much she respected me

353
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,380
She's, you see, among all the maharajas, Jaipur is the

354
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,020
highest and that maharani is the highest lady. And they had lots of problems otherwise

355
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,190
They had lots of problems, now how this happened

356
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:36,599
This gentleman got his Realization in Delhi. I think, three four years back. He comes from Jaipur

357
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,599
He said,"Mother, we must have something in Jaipur. I said, "You go this time and try". Very powerful person

358
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,890
and

359
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,170
He went and saw her. He gave her Realization, he gave Realization to the maharaja,

360
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
and they had some case of

361
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
billions and billions

362
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,170
rupees worth of case in the court, which was not decided, and they were on the verge of losing it

363
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,859
But when she got her Realization, within eight days, that case was decided in their favor and this she

364
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,850
understood is a

365
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,850
very good omen

366
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,150
But just from Realization only, she completely got

367
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,970
drenched into Sahaja Yoga

368
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,590
But she triggered

369
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,210
So when some people say,"Mother I have still this problem", then this is you are not triggering it

370
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,640
You shouldn't have any problem. If you have any problem, then there's something wrong with you

371
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,550
that must be corrected

372
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:48,070
Not only that you are going to solve your problem, but you are going to trigger out

373
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,230
in such a manner that you are going to solve the problem of all the people,

374
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,930
all the world

375
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,450
Still we have one very big problem of fundamentalism

376
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:11,319
We don't have to talk about it, say anything, just go and stand before them and it will work out, depends on

377
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,539
You have to do it. If I could do everything I would not have asked you to come to Sahaja Yoga

378
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,809
But you came on your own, you've got on your own and now to stand on your own

379
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,929
So I feel that our vertical ascent is still very slow

380
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
and

381
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,569
we still are lost into the web of maya of

382
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,140
falling into a

383
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,279
little subtler pattern of our previous lives

384
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,789
Now we are dead to that life, we are a new person

385
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,910
forget it

386
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:05,939
There are so many things I can tell you about miracles, for example, we have cured AIDS now, we have cured AIDS, no doubt

387
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:14,819
AIDS can be cured through Sahaja Yoga. I mean I have cured it, of course. I don't know if you can cure it, you can

388
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
You can, if you can trigger it out

389
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,910
But to you other things are more important than Sahaja Yoga and to develop yourself into Sahaja Yoga

390
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,210
then you can't

391
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,929
There was one boy who came in Karnal

392
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,429
32 years, he could never even speak one word

393
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,619
He could not hear, he could not speak, not sound from him. His sound box was dead

394
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,189
And I said two mantras in his ears,

395
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,689
he started speaking nicely. It's all out in the newspapers

396
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,280
If I could do it, why not you people, just try

397
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,290
I've given you all my powers

398
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,450
They are at your disposal

399
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,770
But there's one thing, you have to be detached like me

400
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:27,019
You have to have concern for each other. Complete detachment

401
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,590
Let your attention be taken to us

402
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,979
Still you're worried about this and that, let's forget it

403
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,720
You are great,

404
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,519
no doubt,

405
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,039
but still the limitations you are carrying with you, you better give them up

406
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,039
I hope at this time

407
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:00,349
the atmosphere is so good

408
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,510
I'm very happy this is happening and they want you to really resurrect

409
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,339
Resurrect from the

410
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:13,579
sense of time,

411
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,359
sense of

412
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,579
aggressiveness,

413
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,849
sense of worldly things

414
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,079
Mundane useless rubbish they are

415
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,049
and fly out into the open sky. May God bless you all

416
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,550
When you all have your dinner and then we going to have some music program

417
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
Tomorrow is the puja

418
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,359
I hope this puja should trigger many things. I hope so. May God bless you
