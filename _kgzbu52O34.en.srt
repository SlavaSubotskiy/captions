1
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:49,433
A new jump has to be taken, Eve Of Easter Puja, Eastbourne, England, 1990-0421

2
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,290
Very nice to see you all here for Easter Puja.

3
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,603
Very nice. Such a pleasure, such a joy.

4
00:00:58,803 --> 00:01:06,803
As if I feel the resurrection working fast.

5
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,080
The year 1990 has come now

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,950
as a special year for all of us.

7
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,736
Sahaja Yoga is going to spread very fast, no doubt,

8
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:30,051
everywhere, all over the world, I know that it has to spread.

9
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:42,588
And also I told you that a new jump has to be taken

10
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:47,840
by all the Sahaja Yogis.

11
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,440
To explain it

12
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,290
we'll say that Sahaja Yoga is spreading in a horizontal manner.

13
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,670
The plane is horizontal and you are responsible for that work.

14
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,065
You are working it out, no doubt.

15
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:12,740
Because of you it has spread.

16
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,661
Some of you have gone all out to work it out,

17
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:22,220
to spread it to villages, to surrounding places, different countries.

18
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,879
Also the events, world events, have helped us a lot

19
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,410
and Sahaja Yoga has worked in a very big way.

20
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:38,874
Maybe it will be difficult for us to really balance it out.

21
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:45,680
But when we move horizontally,

22
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:57,445
we must also know that we have to move vertically.

23
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:07,789
Otherwise, what would happen is that we lose in quality.

24
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,160
Quantity maybe quite a lot but we'll lack in quality.

25
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,430
And if the quality goes down,

26
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,870
then you will see many will fritter away.

27
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:29,839
So we have to look after our vertical ascent which is very important.

28
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,715
If I tell you some of the things that have happened

29
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:37,670
in this short time after I left India,

30
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,652
I'm myself amazed that

31
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:48,211
in geometrical proportions, Sahaja Yoga is rising very hard.

32
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,140
But that should not be complete satisfaction.

33
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:03,651
Individually also we have to rise. And every one of you has to rise.

34
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:03,651


35
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:08,749
Vertical ascent has to be achieved by all of you.

36
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,348
Some might have lost a little bit, some might have been a little bit

37
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,780
away from themselves.

38
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,430
The attention might have frittered away quite a lot,

39
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,629
but we have to know why we are here

40
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,918
and then it's very easy.

41
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,170
We are here to be part and parcel of a very good very great revolution.

42
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:41,169


43
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,906
Can you imagine that we are transforming human beings?

44
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,428
It was never possible.

45
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,742
A-mass transformation is going to take place,

46
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:54,406
that is how this world is going to change

47
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,909
and you are part and parcel of that.

48
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,480
But when you become part and parcel of that,

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,330
you just forget sometimes

50
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,160
that we have many things which are trying to pull us down.

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,840
So we are happy to see the spread of Sahaja Yoga,

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,736
but we don't see vertically what we are losing.

53
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:20,527
and that I think is a greater loss,

54
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,551
doesn't matter if there are two persons less or more.

55
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:34,638
What is important is that we should have very deep Sahaja Yogis,

56
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,589
otherwise Sahaja Yoga will fritter away.

57
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:50,480
So many events are going to happen and we are on the stage

58
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,089
and we have to cooperate and coordinate and understand.

59
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,905
See now for example to come here,

60
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:00,901
David had a problem. He said, mother,

61
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,587
it's just like a tempest, it's horrible,

62
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:07,420
I was there a week back and he was quite upset about it.

63
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:13,186
Everybody told me about this place, I said, all right let's see.

64
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:18,438
And yesterday also I'm told it was raining

65
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:24,139
but in Cambridge it was terrible

66
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,880
and I said, the wind will start and wind will blow on the wind.

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,129
All the clouds were blown out and there was clear sky.

68
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,530
So the wind has started in a way and you can see it.

69
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,335
But you must have your feet on the grounds

70
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:52,100
and this is what I find you people don't realize sometimes

71
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,358
what an important work you are doing.

72
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:59,426
I mean what an important position you are

73
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:07,567
and what an achievement

74
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:17,850
you are going to have yourself and,

75
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:30,319
and what a great boon you are going to bestow upon human beings.

76
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:38,339
So when we come out of family life for example,

77
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:45,447
we have come to Sahaja Yoga giving up all these things,

78
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:50,077
giving up all these mundane things, clothes, this that, house,

79
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:55,901
a car, then family life, relationships, everything.

80
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:02,195
We came here to seek truth and to be one with God.

81
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:11,399
Not that you have to sort of take to sanyaasa,

82
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,909
but given up means you are detached...

83
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:18,975
and you are attached to one principle that you have to achieve

84
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:23,176
Godliness within you.

85
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,228
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga,

86
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:34,739
I've seen the beauty of Sahaja Yoga, then again you want to go back

87
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:38,939
to those useless things.

88
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,889
Then you cannot explain why it happens like that.

89
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:48,323
Like somebody gets married he gets lost with his wife.

90
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:52,079
He gets a house, he gets lost with the house.

91
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,409
He gets a car, he gets lost with the car.

92
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,566
He gets a job, he gets lost with the job.

93
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:03,569
He gets a factory, he gets money, he gets lost.

94
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,976
So what have you given up?

95
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:12,856
The detachment is not there.

96
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:15,377
When you have known there is no joy now in all these things,

97
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:18,178
that's why you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

98
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,420
Joy is in one thing is to be connected to the Divine Power.

99
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,897
Not to all these things, these are not important.

100
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:34,253
Or you didn't come here out of hypocrisy

101
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:41,880
or you didn't come here for any gains of a mean quality.

102
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:54,381
You came for a very precious thing, something of supreme value;

103
00:09:54,582 --> 00:10:00,232
giving up all that is so useless.

104
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,705
You are among them, you are there,

105
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,339
but if you get attached to it again,

106
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,940
then you lose lots of your energy and mine too.

107
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,272
So the detachment that you had developed before coming to Sahaja Yoga

108
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:26,001


109
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:29,309
should be there. But what I find, once they get into Sahaja Yoga,

110
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:29,309


111
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,464
they get a job, "Now I'm busy with my job. I can't do anything else"

112
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:33,863


113
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:36,101
Another will say, "I have a school to attend to".

114
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,101


115
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,389
"I have got my children". Somebody will say, "It's my wife".

116
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,054
Then some becomes very romantic, they fall in love.

117
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,631
All kinds of nonsense they do.

118
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,759
When you have come in the boat, how can you jump back?

119
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:03,731
So it's very important to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

120
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:07,335
Nothing can attract us,

121
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:12,148
nothing can deter us, nothing can take away our attention,

122
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:18,144
but one thing that we are here for the emancipation of human beings

123
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,847
and that our own character, our own style,

124
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:26,027
our own personality is going to change it.

125
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,908
I'll give an example of that.

126
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:33,458
When I was going to Russia for the second time,

127
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,112
in the family they said, "You have been already there, why do you want

128
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:38,848
to go again, after all, you've been there first

129
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:42,204
and again you want to go for two three days. I mean a yoga,

130
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,583
a seminar can be looked after by other people who are there".

131
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,829
I said, "No I have to go". But they insisted and then I said,

132
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,510
"You see I have a plan that if I go there,

133
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,347
there will be lots of people from all these countries

134
00:11:57,547 --> 00:12:00,070
which are called as Eastern Bloc

135
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,855
and I think I can break it through Sahaja Yogis,

136
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,407
if they get their realization."

137
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:12,388
I was just saying that we should get really some remarkable people to come.

138
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,388


139
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:15,762
And they gave merely 45 minutes to speak to them.

140
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:20,416
I spoke for about 35 minutes, I should say, or 32 minutes

141
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,963
and I then gave them Realization.

142
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:28,169
Tremendous people, tremendous personality I touched.

143
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,025
When I went out they all walked with me, nobody was there in the hall

144
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:36,338
to listen to anybody else. The whole seminar was over.

145
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:39,347
And they gave me their address, they gave me their phone number,

146
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,839
everything. And they were after me

147
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:45,779
and I had no paper, pencil; somebody was writing it

148
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:49,335
And I was very satisfied

149
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:54,538
I could see clearly in their personality that they are very deep people

150
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:54,538


151
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:59,739
As soon as they went back, the Paramchaitanya triggered it

152
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,650
and you know what happened with the Eastern Bloc

153
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:09,810
Tremendous people there are, they are tremendous people.

154
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:13,548
Russians are tremendous and these people are tremendous.

155
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:17,801
Very high quality seekers

156
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,842
Same about Hungary.

157
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,111
Everybody were saying, "what about Hungary, Mother?" before that.

158
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:33,231
I said," let one come from there".

159
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:39,839
And really one came quite sick, you know, thinned out sick person.

160
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,139
He got his realization and here it is, Hungary is free.

161
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,252
Same with Romania.

162
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,499
So what is the difference in quality that we are supposed

163
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,834
to become people from free countries,

164
00:13:55,035 --> 00:14:01,411
and those who were in the shackles of communism.

165
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:07,769
I don't know, but maybe

166
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,459
they must have been great people to be born there perhaps

167
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:17,764
Because Lenin talked of stateless state and things like that,

168
00:14:17,964 --> 00:14:21,052
but I don't know what to say.

169
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:24,282
But one thing for definite

170
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:29,987
they had no time to waste their attention here and there.

171
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:34,451
No nonsenses of religion, no nonsenses of conditioning,

172
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:39,142
no nonsenses of all kinds of theories,

173
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,451
no nonsenses of becoming hippies

174
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:44,931
and no nonsenses of becoming these punks

175
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:51,360
and this and that and all sorts of nonsense. Nothing.

176
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,281
Of course I don't say that when I went there I found people -

177
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:59,522
at least 25% who were who are asking for American jeans,

178
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,639
but that's different- only 25%.

179
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,930
The rest of them, just clean plates, absolutely clean plates.

180
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,000
Very nicely combed their hair with oil and all that,

181
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,817
very smart people.

182
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:23,558
No inhibitions of asking me about themselves

183
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,636
and nothing of the kind. No hypocrisy, nothing.

184
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:33,359
No fashions. No fashions.

185
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:42,603
Very straightforward, simple, educated, dignified people.

186
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:49,239
Nobody walking with funny gestures or anything, very dignified.

187
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,140
They were supposed to be people in the shackles of communism.

188
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,529
And one person has written

189
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,728
the mathematical calculation of Shri Chakra

190
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:06,158
and he very humbly came to me, sat down, to know all about it.

191
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:10,528
Their humility was, I can't explain to you

192
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:13,028
Even to touch the platform

193
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,325
with such humility and discipline they came.

194
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,271
Whatever it is, whatever the regime must have been to them

195
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:23,979
or whatever it is, they are not abandoned people.

196
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,810
It's a kind of a proper discipline of their mind.

197
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:36,692
The mind is so receptive, so humble.

198
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,762
In this so-called freedom we have lost quite a lot of ourselves, I think.

199
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,908
First of all experimenting ourselves

200
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:51,022
with all kinds of nonsense;

201
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:55,447
talking about things that we should not;

202
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,406
seeing things as in the name of freedom,

203
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:02,949
which we should never see, as human beings.

204
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,229
Anything people can do in a free country.

205
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,341
I think, unless and until you have Realization,

206
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,902
freedom has no meaning because they get abandoned.

207
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,494
Completely they abandon all their qualities,

208
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,510
all their value systems, everything.

209
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:28,538
So we come to a point to understand that we have harmed ourselves,

210
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,739
we have harmed our attentions.

211
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:40,660
First, one thing, that in the family system,

212
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,470
the parents used to be cruel and funny and this and that.

213
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,960
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis,

214
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,280
so now you are so much attached to your children

215
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,970
that it's also not good.

216
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,320
"This is my child, this is my wife, this is my house."

217
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,110
How can it be now?

218
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,380
Now you have become a free bird.

219
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:12,468
So, today is the Easter day as we are celebrating today.

220
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:15,651
And Easter time, one has to remember that

221
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:20,917
now we are free. We are not eggs anymore inside the shell.

222
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,800
We are now birds.

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,940
We need not carry the yellow of the egg on our head

224
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,480
to boast about it. Now finished now, that's done.

225
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,758
It's no more there.

226
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:39,730
So why should we go and try to become eggs again?

227
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,108
What's the wisdom?

228
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:50,530
And then another shocking thing that I have seen is this that

229
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,313
we have come out of a sense of,

230
00:18:57,514 --> 00:19:04,240
we have come out of sense of dominating others,

231
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:08,039
intimidating others, making fun of others,

232
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,050
hating others, all these bad things that we had freedom to do,

233
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,200
to talk rudely to others, we have freedom you know,

234
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,990
freedom to hurt.

235
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:27,240
When we have given up all that, then I find that as Sahaja Yogis,

236
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:30,549
people are still doing it.

237
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,750
That role is over.

238
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:40,885
Say now, you were a policeman, but now you have become a priest.

239
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:44,748
I shouldn't say priest, but what should I say then?

240
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:47,073
They are equally bad!

241
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:52,615
I should say, now you have become a Realized soul.

242
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,609
So, now when you have become the Realized soul,

243
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:05,726
you are the bird, you are the real free bird,

244
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:11,359
which has got wings, which has got eyes, which can fly,

245
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,408
which does not have those qualities which you had as eggs.

246
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:20,718
It's completely transformed. It's finished.

247
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:27,018
It's mythical. You cannot become that now.

248
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:33,949
If a bird wants to become an egg, it will suffocate and die.

249
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,732
This reverse direction is not possible.

250
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,029
But why?

251
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:43,795
Why to be in the reverse direction?

252
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:48,048
You should ask question to ourselves.

253
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,213
We have to ascend.

254
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:56,179
So in resurrection we have to learn detachment.

255
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,309
It's only mental.

256
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:05,202
I mean, I don't know how can a bird be attached to an egg.

257
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:08,562
It could be attached to an egg thinking, "Oh, how cozy I was,

258
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:13,609
I didn't have to fly". Or something like that could be, you see.

259
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,051
I mean only bad things there are to be an egg

260
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,617
and to think about an egg. But I don't know how

261
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:23,959
it can be attached or on the contrary it would abhor that life,

262
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,410
"Oh baba, what I was? Where I was?"

263
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:38,949
In the same way we should also feel

264
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:47,989
a kind of glory that we are.

265
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:56,167
But there's no vanity in it, it's a pride.

266
00:21:56,368 --> 00:22:01,930
Is an assumption,

267
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,259
is an acceptance.

268
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,650
You are sitting on a throne.

269
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,569
Now you cannot enjoy a mud, can you?

270
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,644
So when we reverse back, when our mind goes in a reverse direction,

271
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:26,870
you have to understand that we are slipping out.

272
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,660
That is very important.

273
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,723
My experience of Australia was rather saddening because

274
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:37,399
I found that it slipped out completely, all of them.

275
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,057
Absolutely slipped out. The leaders were like jailers

276
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:46,053
and the way they behaved and some of them who joined them

277
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:50,610
and it was like a regime and it's horrible things,

278
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:54,189
hitlerish.

279
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:59,916
So I had to pull them back again onto the boat.

280
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:04,969
I had to work very hard, very very hard with them.

281
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:12,248
This is so-called freedom that we have, that has ruined them.

282
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:19,998
Another miracle took place that I went out to a place called Cairns,

283
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:25,790
which is a very far fetched place near Equator, at the tip of Australia.

284
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,457
And they told me that the Great Barrier Reef is very close from here

285
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:37,177
and there are fishes called as Crown thorn.

286
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:41,198
What do we call them? Crown thorn. What fishes?

287
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,592
Starfishes, starfishes,

288
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,731
and these are eating all those little little animals

289
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:49,849
that make those beautiful corals there.

290
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,239
And that's when the regeneration has stopped from the 10 years.

291
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:55,932
God knows from where they have come, shoals of them and shoals of them.

292
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:59,900
I said, "I would like to go and see this Great Barrier Reef, let's see."

293
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,840
So went down, there was a boat which was to sink halfway, halfway,

294
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:05,839


295
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,470
we were sitting there and watching everything.

296
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,713
They said you'll see those fishes there.

297
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:22,190
I saw big big turtles and I saw beautiful, very beautiful fishes

298
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:28,940
of such varieties, such colors, very gently passing.

299
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,405
But not a single fish that starfish, not a single.

300
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:37,262
I said,  "let's see, let's see". So we went round and round quite a lot.

301
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:41,535
Wanted to see one at least, what sort of a thing it is.

302
00:24:41,736 --> 00:24:44,290
Went around the whole thing, not a single thing.

303
00:24:44,491 --> 00:24:49,575
And this happened on the 10th I was there.

304
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,787
On the 17th we were travelling in the plane,

305
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:55,151
they announced a miracle has happened

306
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:59,050
that all these fishes have disappeared and

307
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:02,359
some who were there are dying

308
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Can you imagine?

309
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:22,512
So what I'm trying to tell you, that you have those eyes,

310
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:29,979
you have that personality that can trigger all these things.

311
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:40,269
If 2-3 east German Sahaja Yogis who got realization

312
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:49,869
can go and trigger, and the Berlin Wall can fall down,

313
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,149
then with all these Sahaja Yogis I don't know what should happen.

314
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:03,380
That you have, that power you have.

315
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:08,613
That's why I say that vertical improvement has to be there.

316
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:13,180
And then let that power act and trigger.

317
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,540
You all can trigger it individually and collectively,

318
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,884
but vertical program is less,

319
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:29,115
vertical understanding is less.

320
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,939
Any number of Sahaja Yogis we may have,

321
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:38,615
but if they cannot trigger, then what's the use?

322
00:26:40,912 --> 00:26:42,960
So my request is that,

323
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:50,771
we have to now pay attention to our vertical movement,

324
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:54,670
and to our attention.

325
00:26:56,921 --> 00:27:00,029
Same about marriages. I mean sometimes I feel

326
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:04,825
I don't know why I married them, but they get lost.

327
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:09,160
Imagine I can't understand.

328
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,311
You marry in Sahaja Yoga, you marry for Sahaja Yoga,

329
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,583
you want to have children who are Sahaja Yogis,

330
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:20,459
you want to have Realized souls, you want to support Sahaja Yoga,

331
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,969
and that's why you marry and you get lost in marriages.

332
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,060
Somebody comes and ask me, "Mother, there's a very nice job I can get".

333
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:30,112
"Alright, may God bless you".

334
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:34,889
The God blessings is lost to Sahaja Yoga though.

335
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:43,030
So these temptations are there because we are not detached.

336
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,319
So on this great day, I have to tell you

337
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,919
that now we have become birds

338
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,030
and we don't want to be eggs again by any chance.

339
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,940
We're not going to go back to that state

340
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,180
and we have to trigger so many things.

341
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,220
You all have come to England, the whole England should be triggered.

342
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,775
There's another good news I must give you.

343
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,975
I went down to Jaipur.

344
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:15,840
Only one gentleman from Delhi went down to Jaipur to organize

345
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,240
and Jaipur people said, "it is very difficult you see here, this and that".

346
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,190
He said, "No, I'll have the program in Govindji's mandir,

347
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:28,327
where nobody can have programme, I'll go and see the maharani".

348
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,580
So, maharani would not meet him, he was insisting,

349
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,876
sitting there, waiting for her, ultimately he got a chance.

350
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:36,596
He went and talked to her. He showed her my photograph.

351
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:39,502
Immediately she took to me, she asked about Sahaja Yoga,

352
00:28:39,702 --> 00:28:42,483
"What is Sahaja Yoga?" then she said, "Give me Realization".

353
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:44,816
She got Realization, the maharaja got Realization.

354
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,348
They said, "Yes, we can have the program here".

355
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:50,680
She said, "I'll come to the program" She came down herself.

356
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,200
She fell at my feet in the public,

357
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:56,364
sitting there all the time, her husband sitting there

358
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:59,298
and somebody offered them some water to drink.

359
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:01,570
They said, "how can I?" She's the goddess,

360
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,124
I can't drink before her, she sat there.

361
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:09,269
Imagine, she just got her Realization. What a depth.

362
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,926
But that's not enough. They have one festival called Gangaur.

363
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,468
That is a thing where they worship Gauri.

364
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,769
That's the biggest festival where the queen, maharani,

365
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,346
has to worship the Gangauri. It's is a statue which goes round

366
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:29,386
the whole of Jaipur State and everybody celebrates it.

367
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,738
It's regarded as the biggest festival. So, she in the morning,

368
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,352
she came and touched my feet and she said,

369
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:39,965
"Mother, Can I worship you?". I said, "why?"

370
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:44,099
"Because you are my Gangaur, really, that's just a statue."

371
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,489
She made me stand the same way, she did everything,

372
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,910
She made me eat betel. I don't eat all that, but she said,

373
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:54,899
"you have to, you are Gangaur, so I you have to eat it."

374
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,763
And she worshiped me and all her whole ritual

375
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:02,559
she did for about 45 minutes and then she said

376
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,684
"now I'll go and worship that statue." Nobody's allowed to go there.

377
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:09,502
She took me there, she make Me sit in a very nice place,

378
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:15,050
like this, decorated.  How much she respected me.

379
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:20,717
She's, you see, among all the maharajas, Jaipur is the highest

380
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:23,405
and that maharani is the highest lady.

381
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,070
And they had lots of problems otherwise.

382
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,210
They had lots of problems, now how this happened?

383
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,447
This gentleman got his Realization in Delhi,

384
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:36,840
I think, three four years back. He comes from Jaipur.

385
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,417
He said,"Mother, we must have something in Jaipur. I said,

386
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:44,192
"You go this time and try". Very powerful person.

387
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:46,654
And he went and saw her.

388
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,752
He gave her Realization, he gave Realization to the maharaja,

389
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:55,123
and they had some case of billions and billions

390
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:59,405
rupees worth of case in the court, which was not decided,

391
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,079
and they were on the verge of losing it.

392
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,676
But when she got her Realization, within eight days,

393
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:07,739
that case was decided in their favor

394
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:13,239
and this she understood is a very good omen.

395
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:20,338
But just from Realization only, she completely got drenched into Sahaja Yoga.

396
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:21,017


397
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,780
But she triggered.

398
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,579
So when some people say,"Mother I have still this problem",

399
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,109
then this is you are not triggering it.

400
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,274
You shouldn't have any problem. If you have any problem,

401
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:40,749
then there's something wrong with you

402
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,990
that must be corrected.

403
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,505
Not only that you are going to solve your problem,

404
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:50,625
but you are going to trigger out in such a manner that

405
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,444
you are going to solve the problem of all the people,

406
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:58,138
all the world

407
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:04,067
Still we have one very big problem of fundamentalism.

408
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,029
We don't have to talk about it, say anything,

409
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:13,463
just go and stand before them and it will work out, depends on.

410
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:17,326
You have to do it. If I could do everything

411
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:20,829
I would not have asked you to come to Sahaja Yoga.

412
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,638
But you came on your own, you've got on your own

413
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:29,136
and now to stand on your own.

414
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:36,700
So I feel that our vertical ascent is still very slow

415
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:46,996
and we still are lost into the web of maya of falling into

416
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:52,180
a little subtler pattern of our previous lives.

417
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,757
Now we are dead to that life, we are a new person.

418
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:59,730
Forget it.

419
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,870
There are so many things I can tell you about miracles, for example,

420
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:07,649
we have cured AIDS now, we have cured AIDS, no doubt.

421
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,047
AIDS can be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

422
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:12,430
I mean I have cured it, of course.

423
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,020
I don't know if you can cure it, you can.

424
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,480
You can, if you can trigger it out.

425
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,722
But to you other things are more important than Sahaja Yoga

426
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:25,409
and to develop yourself into Sahaja Yoga,

427
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,610
then you can't.

428
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,630
There was one boy who came in Karnal,

429
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:41,629
32 years, he could never even speak one word.

430
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,312
He could not hear, he could not speak, not sound from him.

431
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:50,896
His sound box was dead. And I said two mantras in his ears,

432
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:57,089
he started speaking nicely. It's all out in the newspapers.

433
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,680
If I could do it, why not you people? Just try.

434
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,649
I've given you all my powers.

435
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,170
They are at your disposal.

436
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:18,170
But there's one thing, you have to be detached like me.

437
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:29,419
You have to have concern for each other. Complete detachment.

438
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:35,487
Let your attention be taken to us.

439
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:42,147
Still you're worried about this and that, let's forget it.

440
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,719
You are great, no doubt,

441
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,601
but still the limitations you are carrying with you,

442
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:56,042
you better give them up.

443
00:34:56,243 --> 00:35:01,130
I hope at this time the atmosphere is so good.

444
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,175
I'm very happy this is happening and they want

445
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:08,115
you to really resurrect,

446
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:15,338
Resurrect from the sense of time,

447
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:23,811
sense of aggressiveness,

448
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:28,012
sense of worldly things.

449
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:34,340
Mundane useless rubbish they are.

450
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:38,177
And fly out into the open sky.

451
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:42,197
May God bless you all.

452
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,521
When you all have your dinner

453
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:51,621
and then we going to have some music program.

454
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:57,506
Tomorrow is the puja.

455
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:03,416
I hope this puja should trigger many things. I hope so.

456
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:09,825
May God bless you
