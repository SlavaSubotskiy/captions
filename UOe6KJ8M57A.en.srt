1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:14,039
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:22,300
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:42,030
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoy-ing
it very much.

4
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:52,780
Today being the first puja in Maha-rastra,
we have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:01:04,150
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharastra
that people worship Ganesha.

6
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:16,420
As you know there are … eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

7
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:26,520
Maharastra which has got on one side one big
mountain.

8
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,380
On the other side we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharastra.

9
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,549
And also on top we have another moun-tain.

10
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:46,210
So like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara
means the Kundalini itself.

11
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,900
So the Ku ndalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,000
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharastra, as the country which is very

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,650
great, the nation which is very great.

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:11,090
But I don’t know how far Maharastrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharastra.

15
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:26,940
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

16
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,840
a different style, a differ-ent type.

17
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:44,250
The best part of Maharastra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:56,379
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

19
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:06,230
helps you in so many ways and that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

20
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,190
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

21
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,950
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

22
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:30,269
For Ganesha is t he one actually who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

23
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:38,430
is innocence and the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

24
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,159
and egos that are distracting your attention.

25
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:51,780
So the attention which is so wobbly otherwise
in other places can settle down very well

26
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,920
in Maharastra because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

27
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,730
have very good attention.

28
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:13,350
With that good attention you can really do
so many things like now, for example, you

29
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,010
can see the software.

30
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,329
Good mathematics.

31
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:25,580
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

32
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:35,779
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

33
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:39,930
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

34
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,990
He’s a giver of wisdom.

35
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,430
Means just His wisdom becomes just a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

36
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,300
You become just wise.

37
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,659
Now somebody may ask, ÒMother how to become
wise.

38
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,050
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

39
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,810
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

40
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,339
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

41
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,240
He’s so wise.

42
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:17,919
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

43
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,039
who is a Sahaja Yogi because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

44
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:31,800
So he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

45
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:42,960
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

46
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,749
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

47
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,819
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

48
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,270
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

49
00:05:53,270 --> 00:06:02,870
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
in-nately built in.

50
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,490
Only thing is we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

51
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,919
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

52
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,379
what this wisdom is.

53
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,649
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

54
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,949
You give up all your attachments.

55
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,689
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

56
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:32,090
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

57
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:38,080
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just hap-pens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

58
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,569
what is not needed.

59
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,380
In that wisdom you throw away whatever is
wrong.

60
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,330
So that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves.

61
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,659
This manifes-tation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think, not that it is only

62
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:02,550
the blessings, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

63
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:10,460
That’s why IÔve been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our

64
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
children.

65
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,650
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

66
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,210
Tattwa is already there.

67
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,300
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

68
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,449
Once that happens then children are safe.

69
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,309
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

70
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:31,330
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

71
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,460
They will never be again in the wrong path.

72
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,689
But if from early childhood, you did not have
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

73
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:49,759
about Kundalini or about wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate

74
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,759
it.

75
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,479
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

76
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,759
It’s so beauti-ful.

77
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,110
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

78
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,139
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

79
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,809
very wise and I can see the wisdom writ large
on their faces.

80
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:29,159
In this wisdom what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

81
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:38,370
most of our problems are coming from human
beings because ecological problem, or any

82
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,030
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

83
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,759
Or other programs that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

84
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,650
problems that it’s sort of endless and they
cannot change them.

85
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,079
You feel very nice sitting underneath this
because you are fed up … that you have and

86
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:07,730
the prob-lems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

87
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:19,610
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the… wisdom plays such a part in life

88
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:26,089
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

89
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,230
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

90
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,920
You change within.

91
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:41,870
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected o f others,

92
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,620
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

93
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,930
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

94
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,970
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

95
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,459
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

96
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,209
You know practically everything.

97
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,689
I don’t have to tell you anything.

98
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:15,189
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

99
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:25,110
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

100
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,410
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

101
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,050
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

102
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,009
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

103
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:50,459
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

104
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,529
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

105
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,800
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

106
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,540
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

107
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,569
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

108
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:14,209
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

109
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,040
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

110
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,430
He doesn’t have to question anything.

111
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,829
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

112
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:23,610
He is just there.

113
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,379
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

114
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:35,899
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

115
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,089
about things, nothing of the kind.

116
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:43,060
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

117
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:51,379
Small, small stories can show He how you were
so sure of Hims }elf, how He had courage and

118
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:57,830
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

119
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,360
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

120
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,800
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

121
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,009
what is to be done like the – this is the
point.

122
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,730
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

123
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,240
I’ve seen many people who say, Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

124
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,600
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out.

125
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,579
Now, I must say this is a state.

126
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,870
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

127
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,129
Means you are there.

128
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:45,279
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

129
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:54,819
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

130
00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:00,350
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

131
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:07,220
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

132
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:15,440
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

133
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:24,670
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

134
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,910
He’s a thief now.

135
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,769
What should you do with a thief.

136
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:35,750
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

137
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,290
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

138
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,959
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget, not to worry about it too much, Oh,

139
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:56,459
this has happened, that has happened and how
to make this point all right and this gentleman

140
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,459
is not all right.

141
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,459
This, that.

142
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:06,089
Just forget it.
So the wisdom is also in forgiving.

143
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,069
That why Christ talked about forgiveness?
Just forgive.

144
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:13,499
There’s no sense in remembering.

145
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,990
This person said so, this person did so, that
happened so.

146
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,160
Just forget it and once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

147
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,870
right things and useless things you’ll just
forget.

148
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:32,519
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has be íen misbehaving.

149
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,709
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about

150
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,660
Me, saying things, this, that.

151
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,829
It’s all right.

152
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:43,420
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

153
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,559
But what bothers Me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen

154
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,649
to them.

155
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,161
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone I … forgive.

156
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,790
I have nothing to say.

157
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,770
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

158
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,550
to happen to them.

159
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,680
They’re doing this to some one who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

160
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,670
in spiritual life.

161
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,930
Then you can’t play about but somebody’s
playing, then what you have to do is to really

162
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,160
forgive because one thing is built-in in Sahaja
Yoga that who tries to trouble you they will

163
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,949
be trouble also.
So try to forgive at least, at least you soothe

164
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:29,949
them down.

165
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:31,290
All right, I forgive you.

166
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,890
So soothe them down.

167
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:40,019
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

168
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:51,680
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of – I should say – pursue the matter.

169
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,110
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

170
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,860
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

171
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,300
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

172
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,749
You know he steals your money.

173
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:10,209
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

174
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,209
out.

175
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,329
Then you have another one.

176
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,939
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

177
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:21,670
Go on like that because they’re poor people….
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

178
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,569
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

179
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,670
that he cannot reach.

180
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,200
Finished.

181
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,649
As simple as this.

182
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,329
You should just find out what doe s he steal.

183
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,070
Oh, that’s all.

184
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:45,839
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

185
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,560
Now, how am I to save myself from this thief
or how am I to punish him? Just don’t think.

186
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,879
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
any way.

187
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,370
These relationships are just like that.

188
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,009
There’s no depth in it.

189
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:10,059
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

190
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:15,380
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

191
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,400
The wisdom is in living in the present.

192
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,029
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

193
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:27,409
Now, if I say forget the past, then they say,
How to do it? How to forget the past.

194
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:31,539
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

195
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:37,640
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in th e centre,

196
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,159
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

197
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:54,960
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

198
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,279
getting after some one.

199
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,669
Where is the time? Just think like that.

200
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:10,299
Now supposing some one says something to Me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

201
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,299
do something about it.

202
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,909
You must punish that person.

203
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:22,720
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

204
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:30,970
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So our wisdom is finished.

205
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,390
We have no wisdom at all.

206
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,480
Even at the highest level you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

207
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:53,809
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

208
00:18:53,809 --> 00:19:00,700
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sanyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

209
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
there happily.

210
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,340
There’s no wisdom in that also.

211
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:09,630
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

212
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,220
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

213
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,399
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything and that’s

214
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:29,090
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

215
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:39,530
So this wisdom is to live in the present,
is now that you ask somebody, How are you?

216
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,820
All right.

217
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,140
And he’s not in the present.

218
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,240
You ask somebody, Are you enjoying yourself?
Not in the present.

219
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,730
You ask somebody, Are you happy? No.

220
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,750
Then you are not in the present.

221
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:06,440
You ask some one that, Are you hungry? Maybe,
may not be.

222
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,340
Maybe they don’t know even in the present
if they are hungry or not.

223
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,480
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

224
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,030
of unwise behavior, unwise line.

225
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:26,000
If they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,880
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

227
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,470
They’re just in the present and in the present
whatever they have to do, they just do it.

228
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,470
This is a very good practice.

229
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,840
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

230
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,710
Just say, What am I to do right now? What
am I to do.

231
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,110
Like you’re getting out of the house.

232
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,730
Many people leave half way – Oh, my God,
I have left my passport.

233
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,690
They’ll go back.

234
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,210
Then again, some time they will come out.

235
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,170
My God, I have left my spectacles.

236
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,800
Again go back.

237
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,820
Then again they will come back and say, I
have lost this.

238
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,890
I should have this.

239
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,040
These kind of people are very, very common.

240
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,890
So at that style when you are leaving the
house, say, at that time, if you’re in the

241
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,820
present, then you just think, What have I
to take? Just say, One, two, three, four,

242
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
five.

243
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,419
Yes, this is is what I have to take and this
there.

244
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:38,429
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom, itself, means the wisdom acts by

245
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,429
itself.

246
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,010
It’s a power.

247
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,279
Wisdom is a very big power.

248
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,650
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

249
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:51,899
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

250
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:59,130
It’s such a tremendous power that one has
given us that we are wise and this wisdom

251
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:07,570
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly within ourselves.

252
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,940
So today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there.

253
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,170
Now you should ask for wisdom and for that
we have to be in the present.

254
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,169
Every way we should be in the present.

255
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:27,070
If you can try, you can be because your kundalini
has been awakened and you can be all the time

256
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:35,320
in the present, but today you should first
try and get the kundalini established in the

257
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,930
present.

258
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,360
May God bless you.
