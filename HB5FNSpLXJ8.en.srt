1
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:09,418
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

2
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:12,163
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

3
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:16,093
because your Kundalini is the reflection

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,053
of the Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,993
We have understood a lot

6
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:26,153
about Kundalini

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,993
and also we know that

8
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:34,183
through Her awakening only,

9
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,163
through Her ascent only,

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,053
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

11
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:49,153
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

12
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:52,213
of awareness

13
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:59,013
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

14
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:05,163
never before in the history of spirituality

15
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:09,023
people had

16
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:13,213
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

17
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:18,938
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

18
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:22,053
they went more on to the left or to the right,

19
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:26,193
and tried to achieve powers

20
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:34,083
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

21
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:39,033
Buddha has written clearly

22
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:42,193
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

23
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:47,033
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

24
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:54,023
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

25
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,083
This is one of the signs,

26
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,083
"of the people",

27
00:01:59,143 --> 00:02:04,083
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

28
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:12,133
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

29
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,203
means those who are Realized souls

30
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:20,203
know the science of Kundalini?

31
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:27,063
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

32
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:30,113
who must have read in some scriptures

33
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:34,003
or somewhere which is being described,

34
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,983
started misusing it

35
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:42,173
and so they became tantrikas.

36
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:47,023
But tantra, as you know very well,

37
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:53,093
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

38
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:59,053
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

39
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:03,083
is the machine.

40
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,133
Today I think,

41
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:12,023
as we know so much about Kundalini,

42
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:14,993
how it passes through different centers,

43
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:19,113
how it rises, all those things as we know,

44
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:25,003
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

45
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,173
That's very important to know.

46
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:38,113
First of all there's a big difference between

47
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:43,143
you people and other people who got their Realization.

48
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:48,223
First big difference is this,

49
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:56,083
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

50
00:03:57,063 --> 00:04:00,173
Others had to go to Himalayas,

51
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:05,193
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

52
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,033
live in the caves,

53
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:11,033
eating fruits,

54
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:13,163
sometimes nothing.

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,043
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

56
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:23,073
to cover their body

57
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:29,043
and they had to ask for alms

58
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:39,013
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

59
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:43,203
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

60
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,983
On the contrary,

61
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:52,183
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

62
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:57,153
because you can live without comforts.

63
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:03,183
But none of them got Realization

64
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,093
and none of them could do the work

65
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,023
of awakening of Kundalini.

66
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:21,043
So the difference is too much,

67
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:24,053
the way you got your Realization,

68
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:29,993
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

69
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:34,153
and the way you are manifesting those powers

70
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,133
that you have got.

71
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:39,183
For example you can give Realization to others,

72
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:42,013
you can cure others,

73
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,023
you can feel the vibrations of others,

74
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,983
there are some Sahaja Yogis

75
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:51,063
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

76
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,103
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

77
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,983
have tremendous powers of prayers.

78
00:05:57,063 --> 00:06:01,003
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

79
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:13,043
And these powers were available to some of them,

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:20,213
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

81
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:28,983
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

82
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:31,113
This is your special field

83
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:39,013
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

84
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,093
Their field was to protect themselves

85
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,043
or to destroy.

86
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:53,003
So they developed powers of curses,

87
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,123
like sharp,

88
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,013
they could curse people.

89
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:00,983
You haven't got that power;

90
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,203
you cannot curse anyone.

91
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:09,003
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

92
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:18,033
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

93
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:27,213
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

94
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:32,113
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

95
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,043
extremely hot temper,

96
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:39,983
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

97
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:43,213
whenever they spoke about the people

98
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:46,103
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

99
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:48,173
This was very funny

100
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:52,103
the way they were angry with the society,

101
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:57,213
the way they described them.

102
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:04,063
Some of them did not look at the society,

103
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,043
did not denounce the society,

104
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:09,093
did not say bad things about the society

105
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:14,173
but they were only satisfied with themselves

106
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:20,093
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

107
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,203
But you have a new dimension;

108
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,183
you have to use your powers

109
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:33,163
for the benevolence of the people.

110
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:42,063
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

111
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:49,203
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

112
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,073
So this time, we should say,

113
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:57,103
your Kundalini can only be nourished

114
00:08:57,213 --> 00:09:02,043
if you develop within yourself

115
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:10,123
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

116
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:16,123
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

117
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:22,073
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

118
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:30,073
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

119
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,993
maybe with your lust.

120
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:38,043
Maybe your love might be directed

121
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:42,073
towards some person, only.

122
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,133
Kundalini is not like that.

123
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:49,133
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

124
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,103
She doesn't get involved into any,

125
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,183
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

126
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:58,123
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

127
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:02,993
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

128
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,083
should not get involved

129
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:10,993
into any relationship as such.

130
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:14,043
Is possible.

131
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,043
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

132
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:21,083
For example, as I have always told you,

133
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:22,193
the sap in the tree rises

134
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:25,193
and goes to various parts of the tree

135
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:29,013
and then evaporates or comes back.

136
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:34,053
So this passage should be kept open,

137
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,133
and once this passage is kept open

138
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:46,073
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

139
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,213
But this passage can be closed,

140
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:55,023
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

141
00:10:55,123 --> 00:11:00,083
because there are some people

142
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:07,983
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

143
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,073
All right, in the beginning I know,

144
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:12,103
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

145
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:16,083
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

146
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:21,073
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

147
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:24,993
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

148
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:27,023
They'll write long, long letters

149
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:28,123
describing the relationship

150
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:33,993
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

151
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:35,133
Without writing the names

152
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:37,993
they will give all the connections that they have.

153
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:40,183
These are all artificial connections.

154
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,023
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

155
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:49,053
these relationships are of no use;

156
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,123
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

157
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:56,153
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

158
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,153
in what family you were born,

159
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,053
in what religion you were born,

160
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,153
in what country you are born,

161
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:06,153
because now you are a universal being.

162
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:11,193
So you are no more related

163
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:15,053
through these artificial relationships

164
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:20,183
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

165
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:26,983
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

166
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,163
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

167
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,183
give up your wife, give up your children,

168
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,213
nothing of the kind;

169
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:38,983
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

170
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:42,153
we have to give up all these things.

171
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:48,053
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

172
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:52,133
If there are some good conditionings,

173
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,133
still we should give up

174
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:58,133
in the sense they should not be conditionings

175
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,213
but we should be master of them.

176
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,043
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

177
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,133
in their own country,

178
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:08,103
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

179
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,103
I used to do the same.

180
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:14,103
Then England is horrible for that.

181
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,103
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

182
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,153
it's a cursed country,

183
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,183
you just can't do that.

184
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:24,123
You have to take your bath in the night

185
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:26,183
otherwise give up bathing;

186
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,103
and one has to change.

187
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,033
But if you have that conditioning,

188
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,093
then you will feel very sad,

189
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:35,143
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

190
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:40,053
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

191
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:44,093
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

192
00:13:45,113 --> 00:13:47,173
So whether it is good or bad,

193
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,173
if it is a conditioning

194
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:54,113
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

195
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,983
That doesn't mean that you should go

196
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,053
in the opposite direction,

197
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,993
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

198
00:14:02,023 --> 00:14:03,983
that's not the way.

199
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,993
It is that,

200
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:11,993
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

201
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,093
I'll have it in the evening,

202
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,153
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

203
00:14:15,183 --> 00:14:19,103
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

204
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,517
Nothing should control you,

205
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,093
then the Kundalini moves for us,

206
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:28,103
because you must have complete liberty.

207
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:31,133
If you do not have complete liberty

208
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,993
then the Kundalini won't move.

209
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,380
We have conditionings of our families,

210
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,993
of our religion,

211
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,716
of our country.

212
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,836
These conditionings, as far as possible,

213
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:57,806
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

214
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:01,756
family.

215
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:03,856
If you are born a Christian

216
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,696
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

217
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:09,806
Christ you have not seen,

218
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:11,836
you don't know whether He existed or not,

219
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,826
whether this Bible is true or not

220
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,866
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

221
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:18,449
Now if you are a Hindu,

222
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:22,726
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

223
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:26,696
This creates imbalance,

224
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:31,686
because we must have the same attitude

225
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:34,866
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

226
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:37,826
that's the sign of a saint.

227
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:44,756
So this conditioning has to go.

228
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:49,826
In what country you are born is another conditioning

229
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,836
which has to be fought out;

230
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,716
very important it is.

231
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:58,686
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

232
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,726
of different countries but you know very well.

233
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:04,716
After Realization when you rise higher

234
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,886
than your society which is surrounding you,

235
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:11,756
you start understanding and you start describing.

236
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,600
I've come to know about the stupidity

237
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,836
of all these countries through the people

238
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:18,836
who belong to that country.

239
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,836
For example a Frenchman will say,

240
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:24,826
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

241
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,726
he's a French otherwise born.”

242
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,686
Or a Hindu will say,

243
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:32,686
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

244
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:33,886
he will do like this.”

245
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:37,856
So then you understand that you are not typifying

246
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,756
that country,

247
00:16:39,826 --> 00:16:41,716
you are a universal being

248
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:44,686
and you are living like a universal being.

249
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,896
Once you become the universal being

250
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:54,886
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

251
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,686
makes no difference in the world.

252
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:02,746
So then you don't start hating somebody

253
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:06,776
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

254
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:08,716
both ways it works.

255
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:14,578
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

256
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,856
but “darkers” also hate equally.

257
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:21,456
And mutually they believe that they are all

258
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:23,796
absolutely wrong.

259
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,806
If you ask a fanatic

260
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,686
about another religion he'll say,

261
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,866
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

262
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:38,716
And you ask the another fanatic,

263
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:43,746
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

264
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,856
That means all of them are the worst,

265
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,796
in a general opinion.

266
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:49,696
Everybody seems to be the worst,

267
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:50,866
all the fanatics are the worst,

268
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,886
if you take a general consensus, you see.

269
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,691
Nobody will say that,

270
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:57,836
"All right, my religion is all right

271
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:00,906
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

272
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:05,726
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

273
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:09,756
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

274
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:13,806
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

275
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,756
with the other English for misbehaving

276
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,796
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

277
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:20,866
because they are blind.

278
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,811
So here the compassion should come within you,

279
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,490
as a universal being,

280
00:18:26,515 --> 00:18:29,866
that by God's grace you have risen higher

281
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,796
in the real sense of the word.

282
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,756
It is not just you are certified,

283
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:35,716
you are realized souls, no.

284
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:41,886
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

285
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:46,861
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

286
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,916
that you are realized souls.

287
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:52,856
Naturally you must change everything.

288
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:59,756
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

289
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:07,856
with something that is now, you have given up.

290
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,866
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

291
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:15,776
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

292
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:18,796
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

293
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,716
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

294
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:25,686
In the same way we should accept our position.

295
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:30,756
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

296
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,836
with self-esteem and understanding

297
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,776
as to what is our purpose of life now;

298
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,866
it is changed completely, entirely.

299
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:42,756
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

300
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,776
innately, not outside because I am saying,

301
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,686
or is a mental process,

302
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:50,716
but inside you feel responsible.

303
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,826
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

304
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:57,806
and to emancipate the whole world.

305
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:00,886
Once you realize this point

306
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:04,746
then automatically you take up responsibilities

307
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,806
and the Kundalini will rise.

308
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,746
I know of many people who said,

309
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,696
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

310
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,856
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

311
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,866
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

312
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,806
There are many who said that,

313
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,746
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

314
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:29,916
we cannot sing.”

315
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:33,716
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

316
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,776
that people had to tell her that you…

317
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,776
because she would always go out of tune

318
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,766
and very loudly she would sing;

319
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,661
then they had to tell her,

320
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:42,746
“Now you better keep at the back

321
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:44,746
and don't sing now any more.”

322
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:48,906
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

323
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:53,716
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

324
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:56,736
which you should accept that they have come to you,

325
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:02,706
and give up all that you call as fear.

326
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:07,776
All kinds of fear we have.

327
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:12,716
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

328
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,736
left-sided man what he should do.

329
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:20,686
But what a left-sided man has to know

330
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,886
that he is now an enlightened soul

331
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:29,826
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

332
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:33,826
No saint will be destroyed.

333
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,926
Those who will try to destroy you

334
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:41,746
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

335
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:44,926
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

336
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:48,746
very jocular manner.

337
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:50,776
You'll laugh at

338
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:53,926
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

339
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,746
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

340
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,806
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

341
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:01,786
means their destruction will start

342
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:04,856
by their own stupid methods.

343
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:07,696
They'll become stupid.

344
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:10,856
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

345
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:14,806
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

346
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,806
You don't have to worry about that part.

347
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:19,706
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

348
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:25,696
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

349
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,437
So that part you have to give up.

350
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:31,746
You just forgive that person.

351
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:34,926
As soon as you forgive,

352
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,816
the responsibility from you shifts

353
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:43,806
and then Kundalini rises.

354
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:48,786
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

355
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:52,726
but just laugh because they are blind,

356
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,926
because they are stupid,

357
00:22:55,726 --> 00:22:56,866
they are foolish.

358
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,746
What do we do if you see an idiot?

359
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:04,816
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

360
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:08,816
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

361
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,856
So they become idiotic

362
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:17,716
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

363
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,517
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

364
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,806
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

365
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,746
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

366
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:27,706
behaving in that manner

367
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:32,836
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

368
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:37,836
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

369
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:41,746
same about organizations or anything.

370
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,886
Naturally you have to know one thing:

371
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:46,746
that as you are Realized souls,

372
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,786
you have seen the truth,

373
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,866
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

374
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,836
they are going to oppose you.

375
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:57,876
They did this, isn't it, to others;

376
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:01,836
everybody suffered so much.

377
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:06,786
But now no more sufferings to you,

378
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:10,846
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

379
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,836
Just understand this point,

380
00:24:14,906 --> 00:24:18,826
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

381
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:23,766
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

382
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:27,315
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

383
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,726
all this fear and left side will go away.

384
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:35,856
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

385
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:38,806
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

386
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,836
You are so powerful.

387
00:24:40,906 --> 00:24:42,826
Just with one glance

388
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:45,686
you can see them dancing on their heads,

389
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:47,766
the other way round.

390
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,796
As long as you'll have fear

391
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:56,716
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

392
00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,746
who are cowards.

393
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,886
Cowardice She is not going to support.

394
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:04,856
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

395
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,826
You are walking on the street,

396
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:12,806
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

397
00:25:12,866 --> 00:25:16,716
afraid that somebody might attack,

398
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,776
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

399
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:19,836
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

400
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,746
because he knows there are ganas

401
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,716
and there are angels around him.

402
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,696
No one can touch him,

403
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,796
and the one who will try,

404
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,691
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

405
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,806
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

406
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,766
Now you watch and see.

407
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:44,886
So this left side or this fear should go.

408
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:48,686
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

409
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:54,886
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

410
00:25:56,906 --> 00:26:01,696
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

411
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:13,806
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

412
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:15,826
is your ego.

413
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:18,726
That's tremendous, I must admit,

414
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,726
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

415
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:26,686
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

416
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:29,916
because they are anti-Christ,

417
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:32,886
because they are anti-Buddha.

418
00:26:33,796 --> 00:26:36,806
The one who on the cross said that,

419
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:37,806
“Oh Father,

420
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:41,686
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

421
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:45,513
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

422
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:58,726
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

423
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:08,876
There should be no ripple even of anger

424
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:11,836
because you are so powerful.

425
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:18,776
What can anybody harm you?

426
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,856
But if you catch on your Agnya,

427
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:22,746
only you are harming yourself.

428
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:25,776
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

429
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:31,876
So this anger, which comes from liver

430
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:38,766
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

431
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,876
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

432
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:44,916
in the West specially.

433
00:27:47,926 --> 00:27:54,816
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

434
00:27:55,906 --> 00:28:01,706
The first one is acquisition instinct,

435
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:06,816
what you call as greed.

436
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:11,816
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

437
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,826
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

438
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:21,746
and then have a conference against ecology.

439
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,786
In Spain I saw,

440
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,886
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

441
00:28:29,926 --> 00:28:32,766
because every car had only one driver

442
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,856
because it had to be there.

443
00:28:35,876 --> 00:28:38,796
And so many cars

444
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,746
that you just don't know how to move.

445
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:45,816
For your program also is impossible,

446
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,816
you must start two hours earlier

447
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,886
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

448
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:54,706
In France is another thing, Paris.

449
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,736
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

450
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:00,816
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

451
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:04,746
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

452
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:10,876
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

453
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,826
The worst is Switzerland,

454
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:17,761
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

455
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:21,726
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

456
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:30,876
because they are making all ugly money,

457
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,756
they are doing all these things,

458
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:34,846
I mean every kind of sin they have got

459
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:37,836
in the name of acquisition.

460
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:41,701
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

461
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:44,756
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

462
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,896
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

463
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:49,696
I mean, they have become immune.

464
00:29:52,846 --> 00:29:55,836
So this acquisition instinct that we have

465
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,886
and which has been very much fanned

466
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:03,926
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

467
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:10,836
we should try to see it clearly.

468
00:30:11,836 --> 00:30:15,776
In the olden days in the same European countries

469
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,806
this was used for creating art,

470
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:24,816
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

471
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:27,726
Even in our country,

472
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:29,886
artists were supported by the kings

473
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:33,776
and all the big empires that we had.

474
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:38,706
These days there's no question,

475
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:41,756
no government is willing to support the artist.

476
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:45,836
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

477
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:47,926
to play before her.

478
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:53,706
So the governments were not only looking after

479
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,696
the collection of taxes

480
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,671
but they were looking after the artists,

481
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:04,816
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

482
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,926
Like in France you can see

483
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:13,806
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

484
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:15,926
and encouraged artists

485
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,776
to do artistic work,

486
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:22,866
spent her money in that,

487
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:27,886
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

488
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,786
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

489
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:41,776
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

490
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,816
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

491
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,806
So acquisition instinct

492
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:57,706
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

493
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:05,696
That also should not be plastic

494
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:08,846
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

495
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,926
artistic things.

496
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:15,866
Genuinely made, hand made things.

497
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:23,666
Or the music also which is very deep,

498
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:28,816
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

499
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:32,756
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

500
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:38,846
or makes you full of lust and greed.

501
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:43,726
So this is one of the problems of your culture

502
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:48,916
which gives you this kind of a ego.

503
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:58,746
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

504
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,846
then of course nobody can talk to them,

505
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:06,756
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

506
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,896
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

507
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:13,746
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

508
00:33:13,786 --> 00:33:15,856
his head is off.

509
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:19,836
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

510
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,726
he talks in a different way.

511
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:32,836
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

512
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:35,866
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

513
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:39,866
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

514
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:43,696
I went to their house;

515
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:48,701
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

516
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,886
where drinking is not allowed.

517
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:55,916
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

518
00:33:56,816 --> 00:34:02,412
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

519
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:06,746
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

520
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:11,776
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

521
00:34:11,836 --> 00:34:14,786
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

522
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,866
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

523
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:22,806
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

524
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:25,926
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

525
00:34:27,726 --> 00:34:29,756
that we don't drink.

526
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:34,726
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

527
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:41,706
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

528
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:49,856
The fondness for showing off

529
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:54,906
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

530
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:58,806
the way people try to show off.

531
00:34:59,736 --> 00:35:02,776
Like a American lady came from America

532
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,746
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

533
00:35:05,776 --> 00:35:08,716
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

534
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,776
I said, “None.”

535
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:17,876
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

536
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,876
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

537
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,826
any city in England is a pub.”

538
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:28,726
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

539
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,706
All right, just to satisfy;

540
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,756
I thought she’s artistic.

541
00:35:33,806 --> 00:35:38,876
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

542
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,846
She gave Me the list, you know.

543
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:45,886
I said, “Which one is the best?”

544
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,806
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

545
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:51,876
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

546
00:35:52,756 --> 00:35:57,726
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

547
00:35:57,846 --> 00:36:00,756
and nobody knew that he's dead,

548
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:06,756
so for months together nobody went in

549
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:09,786
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

550
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,726
and lots of cobwebs were there.

551
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,886
Then they removed that

552
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,816
dead body from there,

553
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,698
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

554
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:27,776
absolutely intact, you know.

555
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,756
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

556
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:37,726
And there, that is the best pub,

557
00:36:37,776 --> 00:36:40,776
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

558
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:42,816
And I have seen that.”

559
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:47,846
So proud. So where does it end then?

560
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:52,886
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

561
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,896
In rottening things, in putrefying,

562
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,806
you may call it fermenting.

563
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:07,736
It has to end up

564
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:09,846
because the reaction of the ego comes

565
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:14,816
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

566
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,926
Like cheese of France,

567
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:23,776
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

568
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,836
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

569
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,706
It is very rotten,

570
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,836
and the more rotten it is the better.

571
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:40,786
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

572
00:37:40,836 --> 00:37:42,726
absolutely rotten,

573
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:43,866
you can't take it,

574
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:48,886
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

575
00:37:51,696 --> 00:37:53,816
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

576
00:37:53,866 --> 00:37:55,886
He said, “It's very fine.”

577
00:37:56,696 --> 00:38:00,736
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

578
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:02,736
“I've never smelt a cork.”

579
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,896
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

580
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:08,866
he would never have taken to wine;

581
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:12,916
so all things that are rotten.

582
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:15,886
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

583
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,876
how it started, do you know that?

584
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:24,696
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

585
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:28,866
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

586
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:34,896
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

587
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:37,836
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

588
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:42,706
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

589
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:54,846
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

590
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:03,806
And so they took that milk,

591
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:06,726
they called it cheese.

592
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:14,806
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

593
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:16,886
for something which is,

594
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:20,806
something special thing, something very special,

595
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:23,806
and also as you know in music they use it

596
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:28,926
for some special composition, cheez.

597
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:37,756
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

598
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:41,926
which no human beings or animals should eat.

599
00:39:42,786 --> 00:39:46,756
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

600
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:54,706
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

601
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,916
they had cheese with worms

602
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:02,816
and they were eating the worms;

603
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:06,726
can you beat it, it is true;

604
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:09,926
not only the cheese but also the worms.

605
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:14,706
I mean see where we have ended up

606
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,926
into our acquisition instinct.

607
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:23,681
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

608
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:24,846
that's the best.

609
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:31,706
Such rotten things we are eating,

610
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,706
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

611
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:37,806
That's why, once I was surprised that,

612
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:40,846
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

613
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:43,756
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

614
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:45,736
because if you take that cheese

615
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,896
you cannot smell anything rotten.

616
00:40:48,876 --> 00:40:50,806
Even if you put them in the gutters

617
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:52,671
they won't feel anything rotten

618
00:40:52,696 --> 00:40:56,706
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

619
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:59,806
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

620
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:02,736
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

621
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:10,896
So where should we put them?

622
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:16,726
They are so immune to that dirty smell

623
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:20,916
which is absolutely sub-human.

624
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:26,806
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

625
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:29,866
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

626
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:58,551
- so the most elite society was the French society

627
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:04,696
was most diplomatic in every way.

628
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:08,886
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

629
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:14,826
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

630
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,906
diplomatic areas.

631
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:22,716
But they never realized

632
00:42:22,886 --> 00:42:29,686
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

633
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:34,766
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

634
00:42:36,906 --> 00:42:40,796
And later on maybe little politics started.

635
00:42:41,836 --> 00:42:44,906
But this eating and drinking

636
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:48,696
went to such a limit

637
00:42:49,726 --> 00:42:53,387
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

638
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:57,856
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

639
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:00,776
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

640
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:03,716
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

641
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,766
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

642
00:43:05,806 --> 00:43:10,826
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

643
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:15,906
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

644
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,746
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

645
00:43:19,776 --> 00:43:21,696
What is it after all?

646
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:25,806
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

647
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:31,866
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

648
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,686
They are making their money, all right

649
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:34,886
as you are all making,

650
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,856
but the one they are feeding is America,

651
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:42,796
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

652
00:43:42,876 --> 00:43:44,886
And what are they acquiring?

653
00:43:45,746 --> 00:43:47,796
I have been in that society,

654
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,686
they only talk of drugs.

655
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:51,886
All right,

656
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:54,806
drugs they talk not only that

657
00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:57,716
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

658
00:43:58,686 --> 00:44:00,746
They all know where you get drugs,

659
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:03,766
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

660
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:05,766
and their wives.

661
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:08,846
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

662
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:11,806
they do not dress up the way formerly

663
00:44:11,836 --> 00:44:13,916
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

664
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:18,876
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

665
00:44:22,686 --> 00:44:25,686
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

666
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:28,736
elite society has ended up into drugs,

667
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:33,746
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

668
00:44:33,806 --> 00:44:36,796
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

669
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,796
because they have no discrimination

670
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:41,776
to know what is right and what is wrong.

671
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:48,766
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

672
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:51,826
this ego, in the West.

673
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:54,696
So this is the first point,

674
00:44:54,876 --> 00:44:59,706
is the acquisition instinct you have.

675
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,856
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

676
00:45:02,906 --> 00:45:06,846
then every man has a right to look at her.

677
00:45:07,716 --> 00:45:10,846
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

678
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:13,244
– every woman has right to look at him.

679
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,766
Not look at her own husband but another man,

680
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,686
what’s the use?

681
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:18,846
I’ve never been able to understand,

682
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,846
“What’s the use of looking at another man

683
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,696
who is not your husband?”

684
00:45:26,716 --> 00:45:30,317
This acquisition instinct has gone

685
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:35,766
into complete immoral life, immoral society

686
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:43,876
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

687
00:45:45,716 --> 00:45:49,876
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

688
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:52,846
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

689
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:58,686
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

690
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,826
How is it possible unless and until

691
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:08,736
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

692
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:11,826
Even art has gone into perversion,

693
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,886
everything has gone into perversion

694
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:23,856
- because the curse of the Western society is that

695
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:26,856
there is no maryada.

696
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:31,826
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

697
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:35,766
it brings back your maryadas,

698
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:37,876
it keeps you into your maryadas.

699
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:39,826
You are a human being,

700
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:42,826
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

701
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:47,686
You have no right to do that.

702
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:51,380
God has not created you to be sub-human

703
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,856
but to be super-human being.

704
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:57,856
So, this is how it works out.

705
00:46:59,876 --> 00:47:02,776
You can now think about it, how far it goes

706
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:04,856
this acquisition instinct,

707
00:47:06,766 --> 00:47:08,776
about things.

708
00:47:10,796 --> 00:47:13,876
But the second very bad curse

709
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:19,686
of the Western acquisition instinct is

710
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:24,716
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

711
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:31,806
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

712
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:36,846
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

713
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,736
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

714
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:43,886
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

715
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:48,776
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

716
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,716
we had pearls,

717
00:47:52,856 --> 00:47:54,796
we had lots of things

718
00:47:54,826 --> 00:47:58,766
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

719
00:47:58,806 --> 00:48:01,876
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

720
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,796
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

721
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:05,876
all the time aggressing.

722
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,886
Japanese are also following you.

723
00:48:11,776 --> 00:48:14,796
This aggression then moves the whole society

724
00:48:14,846 --> 00:48:18,696
into a very destructive force.

725
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:22,686
You can see every day the wars are going on,

726
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,696
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

727
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,796
they want this, they want that.

728
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:29,806
And this aggression has also penetrated

729
00:48:29,846 --> 00:48:32,746
the developing countries, the third world also.

730
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,846
So, nicely the disease is on.

731
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:46,736
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

732
00:48:47,736 --> 00:48:50,746
How? By giving you joy.

733
00:48:52,736 --> 00:48:54,846
You enjoy everything.

734
00:48:55,776 --> 00:48:58,716
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

735
00:48:58,826 --> 00:49:01,826
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

736
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:05,806
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

737
00:49:05,846 --> 00:49:07,681
because that gives you joy

738
00:49:07,706 --> 00:49:10,796
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

739
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,886
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

740
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,916
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

741
00:49:20,736 --> 00:49:24,826
and in that joy you don't want anything,

742
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:27,826
you don't ask for anything;

743
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:29,776
you just enjoy yourself;

744
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:32,796
you are the property of enjoyment.

745
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:36,916
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

746
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,826
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

747
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:49,796
So into small things you must see joy,

748
00:49:50,776 --> 00:49:55,776
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

749
00:49:56,696 --> 00:49:58,706
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

750
00:49:58,736 --> 00:49:59,816
“What is this tree?”

751
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:00,896
“Mother, we don't know.”

752
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,876
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

753
00:50:02,896 --> 00:50:04,896
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

754
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:06,726
I say, “What are these flowers?”

755
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:07,806
“We don't know.”

756
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,756
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

757
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:11,756
you don't know what are the trees,

758
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:12,896
every day you watch them;

759
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,806
you don't know what is the tree is?

760
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,746
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

761
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:22,896
they will know.

762
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,716
“Mother, this is the place

763
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:26,706
where they produced the best wines.”

764
00:50:26,716 --> 00:50:27,866
“All right, I'll see to it.”

765
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:31,796
And next year they had no fermentation.

766
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:41,681
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

767
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,650
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

768
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,896
that you go and aggress other countries,

769
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:51,786
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

770
00:50:54,766 --> 00:50:57,826
and that really is killing.

771
00:50:59,686 --> 00:51:02,756
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

772
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:04,206
they think we are the Lord,

773
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:05,796
we can hate anyone,

774
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,706
we can aggress anyone,

775
00:51:07,736 --> 00:51:08,876
we could be arrogant with anyone,

776
00:51:08,926 --> 00:51:12,706
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

777
00:51:12,756 --> 00:51:15,349
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

778
00:51:15,374 --> 00:51:17,686
we can kill our children.

779
00:51:18,836 --> 00:51:23,816
As a result the love is lost;

780
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:26,896
no question of compassion.

781
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:30,846
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

782
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:37,796
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

783
00:51:37,816 --> 00:51:39,816
sense of “my and mine”

784
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:43,726
- is that this is my child,

785
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:46,726
this is my country,

786
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:51,836
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

787
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:55,926
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

788
00:51:56,736 --> 00:52:00,796
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

789
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:05,846
This has come from the same root that,

790
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:07,836
“This is mine, this is my country”.

791
00:52:07,866 --> 00:52:10,706
Why? How is it your country?

792
00:52:10,766 --> 00:52:13,786
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

793
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:17,926
You can't create little mud, can you?

794
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:23,776
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

795
00:52:23,786 --> 00:52:25,896
This all belongs to God.

796
00:52:26,716 --> 00:52:29,836
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

797
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:32,886
You have not created even so much;

798
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:36,756
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

799
00:52:36,826 --> 00:52:41,916
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

800
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:45,716
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

801
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:50,756
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

802
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:58,716
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

803
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,726
it starts growing like that.

804
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:07,886
Then the heart shrinks.

805
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:13,158
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

806
00:53:13,428 --> 00:53:16,836
the whole thing is within,

807
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:19,686
the whole thing is yours.

808
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:26,846
When such a heart you experience within yourself

809
00:53:26,896 --> 00:53:29,190
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

810
00:53:29,269 --> 00:53:31,916
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

811
00:53:32,896 --> 00:53:35,876
No question of Sahasrara catching

812
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,806
if you have a large heart.

813
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:41,916
And to keep the Sahasrara open

814
00:53:42,726 --> 00:53:47,706
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

815
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:50,786
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

816
00:53:50,816 --> 00:53:52,816
Who is mine?

817
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:56,846
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

818
00:53:56,916 --> 00:54:00,836
So get out of this small feeling.

819
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:04,706
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

820
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:07,846
They get confined to their families.

821
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,706
“My son hasn't got Realization,

822
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:13,836
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

823
00:54:14,866 --> 00:54:18,726
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

824
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,726
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

825
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:25,706
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

826
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:27,846
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

827
00:54:28,816 --> 00:54:31,726
Everyone is yours

828
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:41,916
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

829
00:54:43,776 --> 00:54:45,776
pure love.

830
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:50,696
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

831
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:53,866
love everyone equally.

832
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:56,866
When you say it is difficult

833
00:54:56,896 --> 00:54:59,696
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

834
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,866
Enlarge your heart;

835
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,896
you'll never feel lost.

836
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:08,886
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

837
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:13,726
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

838
00:55:13,776 --> 00:55:17,756
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

839
00:55:17,896 --> 00:55:23,726
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

840
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:26,866
so it's over, finished.

841
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:30,866
It's there I felt, now here I feel

842
00:55:31,816 --> 00:55:37,746
that pull of My heart was released.

843
00:55:39,746 --> 00:55:43,726
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

844
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:45,866
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

845
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:48,836
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

846
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:55,866
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

847
00:55:55,896 --> 00:55:58,866
First, in the West people don't care for family;

848
00:55:58,896 --> 00:56:01,836
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

849
00:56:01,866 --> 00:56:04,756
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

850
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,866
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

851
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:12,856
with their family, with their husbands;

852
00:56:12,896 --> 00:56:15,776
like glue I tell you, like glue.

853
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:17,866
Sometimes I start wondering,

854
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,726
“What have I done to make them like this?”

855
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:26,776
So now it is important to see these points,

856
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:31,896
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

857
00:56:32,696 --> 00:56:33,916
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

858
00:56:34,716 --> 00:56:37,786
then we have to come to heart.

859
00:56:37,836 --> 00:56:41,786
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

860
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:46,746
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

861
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:48,696
but through your heart,

862
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:49,786
if you work it out,

863
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:53,826
you'll understand that nothing is more important

864
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:57,716
than to love someone.

865
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:03,856
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

866
00:57:04,696 --> 00:57:07,776
Of course in love you might have to say something

867
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:09,756
to a person.

868
00:57:10,696 --> 00:57:13,529
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

869
00:57:13,756 --> 00:57:14,706
so My husband said,

870
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:16,465
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

871
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:18,671
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

872
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:21,726
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

873
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:26,741
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

874
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,816
the truth and she will suffer.”

875
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,816
So this is what it gives you discretion;

876
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:38,756
and love is truth.

877
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:42,706
So to this Kundalini,

878
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:48,766
which is nothing but, is the river,

879
00:57:48,846 --> 00:57:51,766
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

880
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:56,876
which doesn't accept any compensation.

881
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:00,896
The river of that pure love

882
00:58:01,726 --> 00:58:03,786
which has awakened us with such love,

883
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:05,816
kindness and tenderness,

884
00:58:05,866 --> 00:58:11,736
we should try to use that power within ourselves

885
00:58:11,796 --> 00:58:14,846
to be like that because our job is,

886
00:58:14,906 --> 00:58:17,756
She has given us Realization

887
00:58:17,816 --> 00:58:20,896
for the emancipation of the whole world,

888
00:58:20,926 --> 00:58:22,786
not only our own.

889
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:26,786
So everyone has to give Realization to others

890
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,816
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

891
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:34,826
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

892
00:58:35,736 --> 00:58:38,816
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

893
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,796
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

894
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,806
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

895
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:46,856
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

896
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:50,776
May God bless you all.
