1
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:35,581
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

2
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,299
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

3
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:53,373
of Navaratri, and how

4
00:00:54,722 --> 00:01:02,630
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

5
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,117
It's not that only She has the powers,

6
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:11,207
but you all have the powers

7
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,415
and you can all work it out.

8
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:21,157
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

9
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:30,993
With us the Realization is very important,

10
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,585
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

11
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,731
Of course Kundalini is a part,

12
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,051
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

13
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:09,298
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

14
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:39,236
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

15
00:02:41,016 --> 00:02:43,624
which is a very important point.

16
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:52,666
Now, all these powers are placed in that Chakra.

17
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:57,768
So you imagine how many of these powers must be.

18
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:06,812
And Her powers are expressed through

19
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:15,848
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

20
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:23,873
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

21
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:32,740
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

22
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:37,226
- all of them are at work all the time -

23
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:48,156
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

24
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:52,613
and connected all the time to the Mother

25
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,400
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

26
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:02,475
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

27
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,162
so you can imagine it,

28
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,018
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

29
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,708
When this center becomes weak,

30
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:25,587
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

31
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:28,891
Ganas also are weak,

32
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:36,782
and all the powers that could be exercised,

33
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:42,001
cannot be done because of this weakness.

34
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:48,974
It's a very subtle center

35
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:52,572
because it is Mother's center;

36
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:56,200
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

37
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,792
It's absolutely impossible.

38
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:05,987
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

39
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:08,093
then they start understanding

40
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:12,649
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

41
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:21,886
In the same way when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

42
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:27,313
like Ganas, they realize how much

43
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:32,319
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

44
00:05:32,513 --> 00:05:36,322
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

45
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,172
So all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

46
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,280
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

47
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,161
That is Her first and foremost nature

48
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,975
- is to destroy all the negativity

49
00:05:53,225 --> 00:06:00,776
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

50
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,851
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

51
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,377
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

52
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:22,019
then all kinds of physical problems start

53
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:26,339
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

54
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:34,778
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

55
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,976
But some of the diseases

56
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:43,293
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

57
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:49,833
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

58
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:56,188
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

59
00:06:56,484 --> 00:07:02,500
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

60
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,668
So the sin against the Mother when we do

61
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,084
- means when we become immoral.

62
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:16,716
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

63
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,454
which are not permitted by dharma.

64
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,374
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

65
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:30,208
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

66
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,281
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

67
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:37,251
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

68
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:43,005
So any such things when you try to do,

69
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,380
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

70
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,442
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

71
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:57,868
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

72
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,812
- immediately the punishment comes in.

73
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:08,516
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

74
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:12,643
the punishment is more delayed,

75
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:20,401
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

76
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,540
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

77
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:31,934
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

78
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,476
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

79
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:47,440
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

80
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,370
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

81
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:57,894
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

82
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,116
or is threatened, intimidated,

83
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:11,383
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

84
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:17,132
As a result, such a person ...

85
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:48,465
So this center Heart is to be looked after.

86
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:54,640
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

87
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,051
away from the Mother,

88
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:02,633
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

89
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:06,942
who gives us courage and bravery.

90
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:13,085
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

91
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,523
also you can be thrown to the left side;

92
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:22,098
and you can get into all kind of diseases

93
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:26,670
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

94
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:34,366
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

95
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,302
into indulgences without any dharma,

96
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:51,171
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

97
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:55,177
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

98
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:57,935
at the lotus Feet of the Mother.

99
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:09,413
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

100
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:11,711
the sternum bone starts

101
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,574
moving like a remote control and informs

102
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:17,518
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

103
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,808
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

104
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:27,955
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

105
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,858
They said: "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

106
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,979
you can behave the way you want to behave."

107
00:12:35,194 --> 00:12:42,475
All these different types of movements towards the left,

108
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:46,007
takes you away from your Mother.

109
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:51,836
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

110
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:55,059
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

111
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:59,121
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

112
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:03,201
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

113
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,771
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

114
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,953
And this fellow started bleeding.

115
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:11,770
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

116
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,507
I got such strength,

117
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,374
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

118
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,017
and I took the dagger from him.

119
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:23,011
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

120
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:25,332
And the fellow ran away.

121
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,955
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

122
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,979
What I did

123
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:35,271
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

124
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,084
I ran after him

125
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:40,428
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow."

126
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:42,792
They didn't go to the police.

127
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,981
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

128
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,776
the whole shirt was full of blood.

129
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,923
He said, "Nobody would believe." Even the police was shocked.

130
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,654
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

131
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,512
Why didn't you come to the police?"

132
00:13:57,675 --> 00:14:00,131
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

133
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,957
so we thought, better do it ourselves."

134
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:04,547
See the courage!

135
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:09,251
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

136
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,103
and he was all right.

137
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,865
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

138
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:18,227
That is the sign of a person

139
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:22,742
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

140
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:28,516
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

141
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,013
And, he is an Indian,

142
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,372
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

143
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:36,579
I have never fought with anyone.

144
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,769
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

145
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,343
But it happened."

146
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,417
He says, " I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

147
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:47,781
and how I did it, I just don't know."

148
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:50,206
There are many stories like

149
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,927
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

150
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:59,191
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

151
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:07,778
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

152
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,262
or of protecting themselves

153
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,809
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

154
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:18,569
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

155
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:20,916
but it is happening, every day,

156
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:24,224
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

157
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,281
If you believe in the Goddess,

158
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,909
then know that She is extremely powerful;

159
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,329
She is very intelligent;

160
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,477
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

161
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:40,007
out and out, in such a way that

162
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:43,054
you will not know how you have been protected.

163
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,348
But  this faith has to be developed.

164
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,689
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

165
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,033
how you have been protected always;

166
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:54,122
how you have been helped always;

167
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,328
how you came out of so many crises.

168
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,526
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

169
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,979
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

170
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,019
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

171
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:13,027
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

172
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,645
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

173
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:21,776
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

174
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:24,909
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

175
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,728
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

176
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:34,416
that one should not go about like a zombie,

177
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,333
it doesn't mean that;

178
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,475
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

179
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:42,007
But if you have to do something,

180
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:44,705
do it with clear-cut ideas,

181
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:48,551
and also without any fear.

182
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:53,789
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

183
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:58,124
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

184
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:02,766
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

185
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,238
He is fearless.

186
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,992
Again I say, "fearless" doesn't mean that

187
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:12,485
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

188
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,077
It means that you are fearless:

189
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:18,291
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

190
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,556
I mean, this story I told you,

191
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:23,127
because this was not a protection

192
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,176
which was from within, like

193
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,417
Goddess protecting them,

194
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,656
but actually protected himself.

195
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:33,787
So the power had started working through him.

196
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,710
You should allow your mind, your body

197
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,263
to project these powers.

198
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:44,575
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

199
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,353
and the power is there;

200
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:52,086
but your mind which tells you "No, no, no, this is not so."

201
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:55,360
There's so many stories,

202
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,142
so many miracles people have described about this.

203
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:05,023
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

204
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,507
If you have done nothing wrong,

205
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:12,150
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

206
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,735
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

207
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,293
Remember this and believe in this,

208
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,810
that: "I am always protected."

209
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,921
This is something very difficult,

210
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:28,957
because perhaps our mind gives ideas:

211
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,012
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?"...

212
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,851
this thing, that thing.

213
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,944
So first and foremost thing, as I said,

214
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:46,393
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

215
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,674
Supposing now, take it like this:

216
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:52,096
now all Ganas are following you.

217
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:59,854
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

218
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:01,912
what will others do?

219
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:11,586
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

220
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:16,288
This faith also must be developed.

221
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:19,463
I have seen people who are sick

222
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:22,073
- so they must come and see Me,

223
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,420
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

224
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,170
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

225
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:33,167
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

226
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:36,223
cured others, just with prayer.

227
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:41,641
But the faith, when it is not matured,

228
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,412
then they think I, I should treat them.

229
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:46,891
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

230
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,717
Now I have stopped it.

231
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,669
I used to do once upon a time.

232
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:53,438
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

233
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,872
Not only that you can

234
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,163
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

235
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:01,032
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

236
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:05,468
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

237
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:08,445
you can protect yourself; so the whole

238
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,857
thing becomes like a ...

239
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,837
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

240
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:19,095
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

241
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:20,255
all right?

242
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:24,775
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

243
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,501
But when he grows up,

244
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,727
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

245
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:32,226
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

246
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:34,310
how many years I have been working.

247
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:40,599
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

248
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:45,759
so that you can yourself do things properly.

249
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:52,953
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

250
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:57,482
All Her powers She has given you - every.

251
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,915
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

252
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:09,415
You have to be patient like your Mother.

253
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,838
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

254
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:17,328
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

255
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,533
I have known many people

256
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,604
who think they are spiritually nothing

257
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,479
and they have not achieved anything.

258
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:28,995
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

259
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,350
that you want to escape your personality.

260
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:35,415
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

261
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:40,645
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

262
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,564
Nobody can touch you;

263
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:46,630
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

264
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,449
you can support others.

265
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,848
Whatever are the powers

266
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:55,074
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

267
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:59,358
all these powers are manifesting in you.

268
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:03,875
But still you leave it to chance and,

269
00:22:04,054 --> 00:22:07,574
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

270
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:14,438
Now this is one point

271
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:18,962
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

272
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:24,339
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

273
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:31,076
Because it is the Divine power of love,

274
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:36,168
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

275
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,977
But again, when it comes to love,

276
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:41,368
they will love their child, love their wife;

277
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,816
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

278
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:46,993
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

279
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:50,279
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

280
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:54,247
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

281
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:56,344
But now it is like a glue.

282
00:22:56,886 --> 00:23:00,210
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

283
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,570
and the family - very important.

284
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:08,219
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

285
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,694
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

286
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:14,120
But, again I say, the detachment.

287
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,024
The detachment is your power.

288
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:22,877
Watch everything with detachment.

289
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:24,496
Now don't think that,

290
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:28,127
 "Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga"...no.

291
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:32,186
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good" ... no.

292
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:38,694
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

293
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:43,516
how many powers you have already got.

294
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:48,885
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

295
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:53,964
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

296
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,754
No fear of any kind.

297
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,416
You can have fear if you have some,

298
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:02,482
say, lot of money with you.

299
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:06,945
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

300
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:11,462
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

301
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,089
afraid of big thieves coming around.

302
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:18,536
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

303
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:23,278
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

304
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:30,015
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

305
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,665
Who can steal your Self-realization?

306
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,494
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

307
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:48,081
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

308
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:53,696
And who can steal your love?

309
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,827
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

310
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:02,934
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

311
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,816
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

312
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:13,727
then only you feel all these things,

313
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:16,040
which one feels in the darkness.

314
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:27,163
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

315
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:31,647
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

316
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:33,648
watching everything.

317
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:36,938
You have tremendous patience;

318
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,267
tremendous patience.

319
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,273
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

320
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:47,309
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

321
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:51,310
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

322
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:59,368
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

323
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:02,627
that you start becoming younger and younger.

324
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,008
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

325
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,567
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

326
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,486
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

327
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:13,343
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

328
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:19,149
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

329
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:22,374
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

330
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:26,734
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

331
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:34,390
So then, what happens to you

332
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:38,478
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

333
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,022
Because your Mother is there always.

334
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:46,506
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

335
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:48,818
always protecting us:

336
00:26:48,939 --> 00:26:52,668
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

337
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:55,438
All the property She has given us; so what,

338
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:58,160
what is there to be afraid of?

339
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,585
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

340
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:06,700
but an enlightened faith.

341
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:10,700
Now the difference is, in blind faith

342
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:12,939
you have faith but no powers.

343
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:17,107
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

344
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:25,938
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

345
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:28,291
- first in your dharma.

346
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:31,467
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

347
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:40,116
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

348
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,503
and it works, it clicks.

349
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,682
Once you don't have any fear,

350
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:48,488
the whole picture will be clear to you,

351
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,002
because you become a visionary:

352
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,201
what we call in Sanskrit "drishtas".

353
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:58,539
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

354
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:02,936
How could William Blake predict our future?

355
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,506
How could

356
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,946
Gyaneshwara, wrote about "Pasayadan",

357
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,545
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

358
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,911
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

359
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,967
and do this, you are that, now you've got it."

360
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:21,004
He is trying to assure people all the time.

361
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:26,637
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

362
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:28,853
How could it happen?

363
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,468
It happens only when people are

364
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:35,079
in enlightened faith.

365
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:42,829
In enlightened faith your Mother

366
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:47,642
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

367
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:49,259
of discretion.

368
00:28:49,482 --> 00:28:52,416
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

369
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:55,613
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

370
00:28:55,752 --> 00:29:00,375
and You know nobody has looked after him, this that...

371
00:29:00,554 --> 00:29:03,621
He is very well educated, very moneyed person...this, that."

372
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,081
I said: "All right, show Me the photograph."

373
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:09,287
I saw the photograph. I said: "No

374
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:12,443
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

375
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:15,220
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

376
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:18,158
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

377
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:21,383
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

378
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,065
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

379
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:29,045
Immediately I said: "Is wrong."

380
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,530
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

381
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:36,220
Nigerians have written letter to him,

382
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:38,227
that "You put thirty-five

383
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:43,557
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

384
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:48,250
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

385
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,142
and then you can have one third of that."

386
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,088
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

387
00:29:55,385 --> 00:30:00,761
Keep out of it." So he said, "Why?" " It's a scam."

388
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,079
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

389
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,957
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

390
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:11,263
I said: "You can feel the vibrations - so hot!

391
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:13,901
So it is a scam."

392
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:19,647
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

393
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:23,389
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

394
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,045
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

395
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:29,371
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it."

396
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:30,949
He thought:

397
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,889
"Why Mother is saying so?"

398
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,387
I said: "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

399
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:37,748
All right. We have. Don't take these things."

400
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:42,926
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

401
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:46,617
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

402
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:53,236
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

403
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,736
I said, "What happened?"

404
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:57,732
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there."

405
00:30:57,852 --> 00:31:02,335
I said: "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

406
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:06,522
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

407
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,875
that he is going to give you so much money,

408
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,736
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad."

409
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:23,776
In this way, you can gradually experience.

410
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:28,612
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

411
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:32,778
and have faith in that experience.

412
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:37,929
What were you? What have you become now?

413
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:41,403
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

414
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:46,780
- of the Mother's attention on you.

415
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:53,121
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

416
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,120
you become powerful...

417
00:31:56,454 --> 00:32:00,007
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

418
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:08,485
But if you become really a evolved, matured

419
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:14,126
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

420
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:18,022
There's a fisherman in India,

421
00:32:34,173 --> 00:32:35,851
who is

422
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:40,128
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

423
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:44,811
So one day, he was going on a boat

424
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:48,700
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:52,580
And when he came out of his hut, he found

426
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,239
huge big clouds, black ones,

427
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,925
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

428
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,452
Just he stood on the shore

429
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:02,789
and told Vishnumaya,

430
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:06,041
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

431
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:08,140
I am going for the work of Mother,

432
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:11,608
and dare not trouble me on the way." Just told it.

433
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,663
The people who were with him, told me that

434
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,442
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

435
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,311
They got into the boat. They did the program,

436
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:25,589
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

437
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,871
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

438
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:38,092
For which you don't even have to say anything.

439
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:41,407
The powers are so great that they act.

440
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:45,565
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

441
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:48,610
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

442
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:54,037
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

443
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:57,005
could have been very cold.

444
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:04,537
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

445
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:08,961
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

446
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,088
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

447
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:16,632
pull all these pillars down.

448
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:21,454
As soon as they started saying My "Jai", it stopped.

449
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,920
Now, this experience should make you;

450
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:27,703
there was no need for you to pull the...

451
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:33,834
these pillars, but you had to just sing My "Jai", that's all.

452
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,026
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

453
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,829
all of you that thing.

454
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:40,235
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

455
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,795
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try."

456
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,242
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

457
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:51,289
These ordeals if they are not there,

458
00:34:53,729 --> 00:34:56,717
these ordeals if they do not come,

459
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,912
then you will not supersede them;

460
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,392
and if you will not supersede them,

461
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:05,085
you will not know what is your faith.

462
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:08,939
A person who is standing on the shore

463
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,399
will say, "I don't know how to swim."

464
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,606
But supposing you made him jump into the water

465
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:18,872
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

466
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:23,999
Because you do not know what you have become.

467
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,635
You do not know that you can swim.

468
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,888
You do not know that you can also save others.

469
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,500
You are still busy

470
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:35,206
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

471
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:40,602
But if you just know what you have become,

472
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:49,368
then you are going to completely change.

473
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:56,741
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

474
00:35:57,258 --> 00:35:58,991
will cover the whole sky.

475
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:03,666
But this power that is within you,

476
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,795
will not give you ego.

477
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:09,594
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

478
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,243
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

479
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:17,050
and extremely loving and compassionate.

480
00:36:17,231 --> 00:36:21,519
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

481
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:26,469
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

482
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:30,993
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

483
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:32,972
it's a psychological fact,

484
00:36:33,354 --> 00:36:35,648
becomes a very nice person;

485
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,218
it's a psychological fact.

486
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:44,826
So now if you realize what you are now,

487
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,904
what you have become.

488
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,991
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

489
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,777
powerful Puja in a way:

490
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:58,844
because it manifests, opens out

491
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:03,579
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

492
00:37:03,725 --> 00:37:08,578
and since morning I have been just

493
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:13,312
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

494
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:16,744
waterfall of vibrations.

495
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:20,117
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

496
00:37:20,277 --> 00:37:24,185
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

497
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:26,002
That's why I closed My eyes,

498
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,641
because all the time there will be something else

499
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,300
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

500
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,980
I'll close My eyes.

501
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:39,054
But now you are the light. You are the light.

502
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:44,412
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

503
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,446
Because, it can remove the darkness.

504
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:52,630
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

505
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,586
and you live with very small, very small

506
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,371
ideas about yourself.

507
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:05,878
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

508
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:10,661
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

509
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:13,970
What is your decoration is your humility,

510
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,728
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

511
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:21,073
and the way you handle people.

512
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:24,216
You will be amazed, I also tell people

513
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:28,205
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

514
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:30,982
no doubt; but in a way

515
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:33,831
that the person understands it is for the

516
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,789
benevolence of that person.

517
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:43,487
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

518
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:50,863
everything changes; the whole face changes;

519
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,486
the whole movement changes.

520
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,665
The style of talking changes,

521
00:38:57,423 --> 00:39:02,719
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

522
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:11,708
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

523
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:20,985
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

524
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:31,422
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

525
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:37,187
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

526
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:40,147
really from the heart they had to detach.

527
00:39:40,442 --> 00:39:44,331
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

528
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,851
and live on ordinary food.

529
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,692
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

530
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:53,500
Christ suffered so much.

531
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,814
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

532
00:39:57,033 --> 00:40:01,469
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

533
00:40:02,064 --> 00:40:04,598
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

534
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,424
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

535
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:12,758
enjoyment, music, everything.

536
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:24,132
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

537
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:29,158
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

538
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:36,709
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

539
00:40:37,024 --> 00:40:38,941
with which he is living.

540
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:41,044
All kinds of myths there are.

541
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:43,127
Some people have myths: "We are very poor".

542
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:44,892
Some have myths: "We are very rich".

543
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:49,000
Some have this thing that "We are very unhappy".

544
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,929
Some have that "We are very happy".

545
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,108
All kinds of myths these are.

546
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,762
These are all myths.

547
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,357
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

548
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:07,079
complete emptiness. That is joy.

549
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:10,881
This emptiness is filled with joy.

550
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:12,918
Complete emptiness.

551
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:16,063
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

552
00:41:16,286 --> 00:41:20,092
And this emptiness from within is actually,

553
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:25,410
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

554
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,457
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

555
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:30,436
what can you pour into it?

556
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,750
What can you give into it?

557
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,834
So if you are completely empty within,

558
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:41,742
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

559
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:45,082
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

560
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:49,703
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

561
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:53,743
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

562
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:57,654
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

563
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,096
you do not look forward to it.

564
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:04,067
It is there, all the time.

565
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:09,504
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

566
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,294
As you know, the Devi's things are

567
00:42:13,453 --> 00:42:16,309
so very deep and subtle:

568
00:42:17,222 --> 00:42:23,484
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

569
00:42:23,822 --> 00:42:27,214
Her bhaktas with love;

570
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:30,468
how She fought demons

571
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,724
and also negativity.

572
00:42:34,337 --> 00:42:38,098
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

573
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:41,970
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

574
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,857
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

575
00:42:45,995 --> 00:42:48,348
all the time attacking you.

576
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,348
Even if you kill those demons,

577
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,661
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

578
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,439
They should be actually killed when they,

579
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:03,431
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

580
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:07,796
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

581
00:43:07,975 --> 00:43:12,530
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

582
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:15,875
So these negativities, which come

583
00:43:16,172 --> 00:43:19,604
from wrong type of following you have had,

584
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,748
from wrong books you have been reading,

585
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:23,746
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

586
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:27,091
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

587
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:30,966
In that case also, forgive that person.

588
00:43:31,264 --> 00:43:33,883
That person may improve, but you may continue

589
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:38,120
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

590
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,824
So the quality is of compassion and love,

591
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:51,110
fearlessness and courage

592
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:57,153
and the complete emptiness.

593
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:02,245
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

594
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:05,796
what you have to achieve, how many people

595
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,812
you have to gather,

596
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,681
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

597
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:15,760
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

598
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,193
and you will not hanker: "Oh my God,"

599
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:21,694
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

600
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:23,686
It is good for us in a way,

601
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:27,917
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

602
00:44:29,658 --> 00:44:35,662
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

603
00:44:36,693 --> 00:44:41,038
But we must definitely take over the people

604
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:44,551
who are genuinely good.

605
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,230
One thing more I would like to tell you,

606
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:51,289
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

607
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:55,019
In one shot they will go away.

608
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:58,571
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

609
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:01,757
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

610
00:45:01,937 --> 00:45:06,996
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

611
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:11,650
And I see, I go late always to any program,

612
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:15,591
so those who are useless just disappear.

613
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:19,055
And some of them disappear half-way through,

614
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:21,781
because nothing goes into their head, really,

615
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,116
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

616
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:29,514
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

617
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:32,716
and they get, all of them, Realization.

618
00:45:32,935 --> 00:45:35,090
In Sanskrit they call it "cheyen"

619
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:39,792
- means "selection". This is a natural selection that takes place,

620
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,486
and how people go away and how they come back

621
00:45:45,863 --> 00:45:48,950
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

622
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:54,843
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

623
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:56,521
You should not get upset.

624
00:45:56,661 --> 00:45:59,797
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

625
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:01,950
and not so much from Switzerland,

626
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,950
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

627
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:13,748
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

628
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:20,018
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

629
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,963
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

630
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:26,971
or from some African land, it's all right.

631
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:32,064
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

632
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,170
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

633
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:39,341
So this attachment, in a way,

634
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,638
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

635
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,623
because you want to have company.

636
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:49,266
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

637
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:52,551
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

638
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,845
- difficult. So you want to have company.

639
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:57,514
So you want to have more and more and more.

640
00:46:57,634 --> 00:46:58,843
But doesn't matter.

641
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:01,223
As many as there are sufficient,

642
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:04,959
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

643
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:08,976
But when we want to share our love,

644
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:13,063
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

645
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:15,436
but because we cannot share.

646
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:19,515
That time a new personality rises,

647
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:24,972
and this new personality is the one which works.

648
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:28,117
I mean we are not giving you any money;

649
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,211
there are no awards for you.

650
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,286
There's no way there's much encouragement,

651
00:47:33,456 --> 00:47:36,563
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

652
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:38,269
nothing of the kind.

653
00:47:38,428 --> 00:47:41,345
Can you imagine in any organization

654
00:47:41,464 --> 00:47:44,837
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

655
00:47:45,016 --> 00:47:48,777
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

656
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,269
also they give you promotions;

657
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:56,091
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

658
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:58,920
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

659
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:02,544
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

660
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:05,222
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

661
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:08,517
Only thing is that you want to share.

662
00:48:09,725 --> 00:48:11,152
You can't help it,

663
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:13,351
it's like a drunkard you see.

664
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,122
If he has a bottle,

665
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,505
he must have at least one person to share with him,

666
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:25,876
because he thinks that it would be sinful:

667
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,126
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

668
00:48:29,226 --> 00:48:31,493
So it would be half-half divided.

669
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:49,512
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

670
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:54,147
It is because you are collective;

671
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:57,271
you have become collective, that's why.

672
00:48:58,096 --> 00:49:02,104
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

673
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:05,130
You become a very noble person, you see?

674
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,266
Like, of course drunkards do that,

675
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:11,297
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

676
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:15,039
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

677
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,991
But you think that "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

678
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,450
why not others?

679
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,911
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

680
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:32,228
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

681
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:36,911
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

682
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:41,009
I mean, no words can describe My joy

683
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:45,494
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

684
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:49,613
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

685
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:55,665
and I was really very much amazed and touched

686
00:49:56,062 --> 00:50:02,899
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

687
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:08,573
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

688
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:12,625
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

689
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:17,370
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

690
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:21,140
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

691
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:26,021
The "New Age" people talk of is here, no doubt.

692
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:30,926
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

693
00:50:31,224 --> 00:50:34,424
But what is the "new" now is the new collectivity,

694
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:39,180
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

695
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:45,112
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

696
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:48,230
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

697
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,901
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

698
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,889
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

699
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:57,895
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

700
00:50:58,044 --> 00:51:03,790
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

701
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:07,699
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

702
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:10,885
the collectivity is prospering.

703
00:51:11,521 --> 00:51:15,350
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

704
00:51:15,568 --> 00:51:17,568
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

705
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:19,896
You want to have other people.

706
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:25,620
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

707
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:31,036
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

708
00:51:32,644 --> 00:51:37,456
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

709
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:39,937
- Australia has been always a problem -

710
00:51:40,136 --> 00:51:42,469
they are making money out of this;

711
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:44,644
so I just don't know what to say,

712
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:47,469
because this is, I can't understand.

713
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:51,747
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

714
00:51:51,886 --> 00:51:56,905
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

715
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,663
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

716
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:06,392
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

717
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:11,719
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

718
00:52:12,076 --> 00:52:15,104
That's what I have to request you tonight.

719
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,064
You have all the power flowing in you,

720
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:24,441
you have the light which is enlightened,

721
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,782
but you must expand.

722
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:30,544
Expand it more and more and more,

723
00:52:30,803 --> 00:52:33,957
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

724
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,806
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

725
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:41,005
and also I am the whole sky."

726
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,783
This is what is your personality.

727
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,579
May God bless you all.
