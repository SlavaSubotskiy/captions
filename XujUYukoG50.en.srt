1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,834
… Her name is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:04,375
She trained as a doctor in India

3
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,875
and She is now married to a senior diplomat at the United Nations.

4
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:08,917
She lives in London,

5
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,667
but this week She’s holding a series of public meetings

6
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,000
to publicize Her teachings.

7
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:17,583
She believes that we all have a form of spiritual energy

8
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,333
called Kundalini at the base of our spines,

9
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,999
which can be awakened and sent flowing through the body.

10
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,583
So I took my shoes off

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,750
and went to meet Her in Northampton this morning.

12
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,750
SHRI MATAJI: You are a person who is more active

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,959
and tries to think too much, work too much…

14
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,125
REPORTER: I think too much?

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,250
Nobody ever said that to me before. Right,...

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,125
SHRI MATAJI: And you work too much physically,

17
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,875
you run about and you are more working outside.

18
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,834
And left side is the emotional side,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,375
so left side — for emotional life.

20
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,291
Well, that’s what is the imbalance in you is.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,250
Now for this we have to first give you a balance,

22
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:58,750
all right? What I'll do is to awaken your frozen side

23
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,250
and bring it down so the grace

24
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,250
comes over here to satisfy this side.

25
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:08,000
So it is to be awakened, you see, the emotional side is awakened.

26
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:12,291
And this side is given a sort of a soothing effect

27
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,667
with the all-pervading Power from your right.

28
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,417
So this is, this is how it moves, right? This is the way.

29
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:20,250
REPORTER: But is this energy and this desire any more

30
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,709
than the desire that everyone has to make the best of himself,

31
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,792
to be happy, to be content?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,667
SHRI MATAJI: You cannot be contented with material things.

33
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,959
You cannot be. That’s the basic principle of economics.

34
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,709
REPORTER: So can I put a contradiction to You,

35
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:34,959
that in the past when all the gurus

36
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,875
that have achieved fame in the West

37
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:38,750
have all seemed to be surrounded by a great deal

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,667
of very affluent trappings, great deal of wealth and money.

39
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,291
That seemed to be a great contradiciton of

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,417
what they’re talking about.

41
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,959
SHRI MATAJI: I’m happy you see that, but how many see that?

42
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,542
Is something one should understand, that it is not a business,

43
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,041
you cannot make money out of …

44
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,959
REP: But they’re making a very successful business out of it.

45
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,917
SHRI MATAJI: Because you are so naive. In
this country people do not use their brains.

46
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,875
You must come to right conclusions,

47
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,208
that if something has to happen to you,

48
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:03,999
it will be in your awareness.

49
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,375
You have to manifest your powers, and then only you will realize

50
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,750
that you cannot pay money for your evolution.

51
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,834
REPORTER: Now we’ve got perhaps three million people

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,083
watching us at the moment.

53
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,166
Should they be able to feel anything or to gain anything

54
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,792
from watching You just on the television?

55
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,166
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, some of them may.

56
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,667
If they are just there, if they put their hands towards Me

57
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,166
just now even like this,

58
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,291
they might feel the cool breeze in their hands.

59
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,458
And then they might feel on their heads coming out the cool breeze.

60
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,875
I mean, it has happened in so many places.
