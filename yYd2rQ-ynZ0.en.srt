00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

2
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,490
Today we have assembled here

3
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,830
to worship Shri Ganesha.

4
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,870
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

5
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:20,620
He is the ocean of innocence.

6
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,660
And though’ he is

7
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,990
such a young, little boy,

8
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,580
he can fight the whole world,

9
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,740
he can destroy all the negativity.

10
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,990
That’s the sign of innocence.

11
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,950
There have been stories

12
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,990
that children who have fallen from a very great height

13
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,990
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

14
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,830
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

15
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,830
that it doesn’t harm anyone

16
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,450
who is not to be harmed.

17
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,290
It has all the wisdom of the world,

18
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,870
all the understanding of the world;

19
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,490
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

20
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,370
the world, the whole world –

21
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:01,370
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

22
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,490
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

23
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,830
but they all stand, stand up against

24
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,490
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

25
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,700
You can see in your own lives

26
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,700
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

27
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,620
all of the them, whatever they are,

28
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,490
whatever they are coming from,

29
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,700
whatever maybe their nationality,

30
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,620
they all jump, all jump to control

31
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,830
and to safeguard that child.

32
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,370
What is it?

33
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,950
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

34
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,540
to protect the innocence?

35
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,450
It’s really a shame,

36
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,370
a great shame for us,

37
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,450
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

38
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,950
Anything else can be tolerated.

39
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,990
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

40
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,700
those who have no malice,

41
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:49,410
who are living like little children, I should say,

42
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,700
if they are attacked by anyone –

43
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,990
not that the whole world reacts to that –

44
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,580
but everyone of them cannot bear

45
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,790
any innocent person or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.

46
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,990
We don’t realise that within us

47
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,700
there is the ocean of love

48
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,580
and ocean of understanding for children.

49
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,790
Why? Why should it be?

50
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,410
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

51
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,990
Especially for innocence?

52
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:59,490
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

53
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,950
innocent children, there are.

54
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,660
But no-one wants to support them.

55
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,660
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

56
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,830
And those who have done this have to suffer.

57
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,410
They all suffer as a reaction.

58
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,740
What is it within us

59
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,580
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

60
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,870
against innocence?

61
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,540
For example if there is a regular war,

62
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,540
and if there are people fighting;

63
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,410
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

64
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,660
In the world also, they say “Alright,

65
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,990
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

66
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,700
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

67
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,990
That’s what human beings have.

68
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,660
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

69
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,660
which gives you that feeling,

70
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,330
that capacity, that understanding

71
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,990
that you have to protect innocent,

72
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,620
innocent children, innocent people.

73
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,410
And the whole world can rise against all such people

74
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,740
who are trying to kill the innocent.

75
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,370
There cannot be any doubt.

76
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,700
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

77
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,540
or criticise such a thing,

78
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,740
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

79
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:19,990
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

80
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,450
and can give up anything,

81
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,410
but they cannot give up the feeling

82
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,290
they have for innocence.

83
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,620
It’s very remarkable. We don’t realise

84
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,370
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

85
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,870
for the innocent.

86
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,790
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

87
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,870
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

88
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,950
That’s the beauty of human beings.

89
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,950
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

90
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,410
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

91
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,950
But when it comes to children,

92
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,830
and to innocent people,

93
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,450
everyone feels his responsibility.

94
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,830
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

95
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:46,950
because they have a kind of an understanding

96
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,870
that they are something great,

97
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,790
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

98
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,370
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

99
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,950
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

100
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,370
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

101
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,870
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

102
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,660
and they can never be honoured

103
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,870
for the thing they are doing.

104
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,490
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

105
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,660
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

106
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,660
You might feel a little bit cheated,

107
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,580
you might feel a little bit dominated,

108
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,490
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

109
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,910
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

110
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,910
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

111
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,870
They should not feel dejected

112
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,450
if they are being used, insulted,

113
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,740
tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

114
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,660
They should not try to destroy

115
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,700
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

116
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,450
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

117
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,830
that when innocence is challenged,

118
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,660
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

119
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,990
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

120
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,450
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

121
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,870
– have been tortured,have been killed.

122
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,910
At that time, all over the world,

123
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,830
it’s a big support for them.

124
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,410
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

125
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,870
is anxious to look after

126
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,740
those who have done this crime.

127
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,700
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

128
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,790
they may not be belonging to the same country,

129
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,950
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

130
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,700
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

131
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,830
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

132
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,490
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

133
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,330
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

134
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,290
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

135
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,410
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

136
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,370
We should not, in no way punish them.

137
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,950
Our main achievement

138
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,740
should be that loving attention for children.

139
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,790
All over the world, whether he belongs

140
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,620
to your family or to some other family,

141
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,370
or has some sort of

142
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,330
detached attention with you,

143
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,910
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

144
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,870
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

145
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,990
will try to protect.

146
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,990
It’s very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

147
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:13,870
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

148
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,700
Children should never be attacked.

149
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,620
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

150
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,410
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

151
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,700
that is extremely inauspicious,

152
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,790
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

153
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,490
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

154
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,950
I have not come across anyone so far who says

155
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,700
that they don’t love children – luckily!

156
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,990
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

157
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,700
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

158
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,620
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

159
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,870
You love nature – why?

160
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,580
Because it is innocent.

161
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,790
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

162
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,870
who are Sahaja Yogis.

163
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,950
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

164
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,540
It’s very easy to be clever.

165
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,370
But to be wise, one should understand

166
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,580
the beauty of being innocent.

167
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,870
Possibly one may say “Mother,

168
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,910
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

169
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,660
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

170
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,450
They may believe that they have done this,

171
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,370
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

172
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,950
It is like a rock.

173
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,790
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

174
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,740
any ocean of anger

175
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,870
or any kind of revenge.

176
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,700
It’s the rock that is being looked after

177
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,830
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

178
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,830
I’ve told you before also,

179
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,700
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

180
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,790
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

181
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,990
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

182
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,910
but it does not get,

183
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,740
it cannot get it.

184
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,490
After innocence.

185
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,740
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

186
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,830
We play with our innocence very much.

187
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,540
We think that by behaving any way we like,

188
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,910
“It’s alright, after all it’s my own desire, my wish”.

189
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,620
And we’ll go on, we go on all the time

190
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

191
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,660
or covering our power of innocence.

192
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,410
And we think that we have done a great job,

193
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,580
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

194
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,660
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

195
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,830
It is not self-sufficient.

196
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,290
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

197
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:31,660
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

198
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,910
which is the greatest faith,

199
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,700
the greatest help

200
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,370
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

201
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,490
Those people who do not respect their innocence

202
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,950
because they think it makes you weak,

203
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,370
have not seen the power of innocence –

204
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,620
how it works, how it acts.

205
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,910
From all over the world, it reacts.

206
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:15,790
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

207
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,620
power of innocence.

208
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,540
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

209
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,790
And it acts

210
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,910
as if the whole understanding,

211
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:42,370
whole working-out of the be-ing

212
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,620
is so beautifully achieved.

213
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,830
Now you see in this world

214
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,540
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

215
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,620
It is respected the high ideals.

216
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:13,620
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

217
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:21,540
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

218
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,410
of very good nature’

219
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,790
– all these people may have been harmed

220
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,490
may have been killed –

221
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,620
but because of their innocence they shine,

222
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,540
and shine through ages.

223
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,290
You can see the life of all great men like that;

224
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:53,450
they are all very simple,

225
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:00,660
they are not deliberating anything –

226
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:08,700
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

227
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,950
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

228
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,370
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

229
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,370
Have faith in that.

230
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,740
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

231
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,910
and that ‘yourself’ is nothing but innocence.

232
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,370
You may say that ‘innocent people get cheated’.

233
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,580
Nobody can cheat innocence,

234
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,660
because that is something of very eternal value.

235
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,490
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

236
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,450
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

237
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,410
And you will be the most successful person

238
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,580
in life when you are absolutely innocent

239
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,580
and your are looking after your innocence.

240
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,410
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

241
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,370
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

242
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,490
by ill doing, it might be covered for the time being.

243
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,740
But if you can take out the clouds

244
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,700
away from the sky of innocence,

245
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,450
the whole thing becomes so obvious

246
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,580
that you have won the whole world.

247
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,410
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

248
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,330
he was insulted, he was tortured.

249
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,490
Those who did this, where are they?

250
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,580
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

251
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,410
Nobody is even bothered about them.

252
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,620
A single one person was so much used

253
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,740
and was so much tortured.

254
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,410
But despite that, what has happened?

255
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,490
He has got the respect from the whole world.

256
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,830
The whole world respects.

257
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,330
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

258
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,950
what has he done …’ Nothing of the kind.

259
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,580
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

260
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,490
the essence of complete innocence.

261
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:44,370
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

262
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,410
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

263
00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:00,330
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

264
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:04,490
and we don’t want to even remember that, we don’t want to even

265
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,700
consider that it’s a wrong thing to do,

266
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,740
we do not know what is ahead of us.

267
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,370
What happened to Hitler also?

268
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,490
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

269
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,290
he can manage to kill so many people

270
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,370
and still he will remain a very great personality.

271
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,870
They are stupid not to understand

272
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,870
who are the people really respected.

273
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,910
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

274
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,330
He didn’t understand if you wanted to have

275
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,950
really the power over the world,

276
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,410
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

277
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,990
he should have followed the great people.

278
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,540
And the great people are those who are innocent.

279
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,580
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

280
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,790
I don’t know how to say that this power acts,

281
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,540
because it acts in so many ways.

282
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,910
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

283
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,370
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

284
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,950
simple and wise

285
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,370
is remembered all your life.

286
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,950
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

287
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,700
I used to go to the library

288
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,740
and read about the lives of great men

289
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,830
who have created some great things for us.

290
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,370
So many of them.

291
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,410
And I was so impressed

292
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,740
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

293
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,660
For example Abraham Lincoln

294
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,870
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

295
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,830
was a man tortured by his wife also.

296
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,450
She said “You don’t know, you are very clumsy,

297
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,290
you don’t know how to dress up, you don’t know how to behave”.

298
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:43,990
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

299
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,580
Ultimately he was also killed.

300
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,990
So one can say, “You see, what’s the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

301
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,870
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

302
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,580
Until today, all over the world,

303
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,540
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

304
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,620
They don’t know his wife – maybe.

305
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,290
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

306
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,950
Clumsy man, according to her,

307
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,450
and all sorts of degradation for him.

308
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,290
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

309
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,660
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

310
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,410
Why? ‘Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

311
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,660
that shows that he had no strength to survive’ –

312
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,990
but he survived through ages!

313
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,910
So many years have passed, still he’s surviving.

314
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,490
Take the case of all the great people

315
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,290
who have been innocent;

316
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,330
and that’s why they had ideals.

317
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,580
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

318
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,620
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

319
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,790
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

320
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,410
comes only from your innocence.

321
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,620
That’s the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

322
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,790
how you should exist;

323
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,990
what kind of a life you should lead.

324
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:56,580
It is not important that you have big authorities,

325
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:03,540
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

326
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,790
There have been so many who came and died.

327
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,370
They had so many people with ambitions

328
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,330
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

329
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,370
Nobody’s bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

330
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,450
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

331
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,450
‘No, no, we don’t want to see this man’.

332
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,370
But if there’s a little boy, innocent child,

333
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,910
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

334
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,410
the whole world admires that child.

335
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,830
And these great men are, really,

336
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,830
they are the symbols of that innocence.

337
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:56,370
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

338
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,790
Ganesha’s main quality is his wisdom.

339
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,830
He knew what was success, through his,

340
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,740
I should say, innocent qualities.

341
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,290
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

342
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,700
quality of innocence.

343
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:25,990
It’s very surprising how the quality of innocence

344
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,490
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

345
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,540
who may be very

346
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:45,990
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

347
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,990
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

348
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,950
they are innocent! That’s were ends all the glory of human beings.

349
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,580
To be innocent –

350
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,620
What’s the matter?

351
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,490
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

352
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,540
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

353
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:27,540
Firstly, you can see for yourself

354
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,490
how your mind works.

355
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,410
What does it do? How it reacts.

356
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,370
This is what one has to watch,

357
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,950
which I call as ‘introspection’.

358
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,450
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

359
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,950
What does it think is the best?

360
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,660
In that thinking, thought process,

361
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:12,290
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

362
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,410
The first and the foremost is that

363
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,330
you should know how you react to someone.

364
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,370
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

365
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,990
It is very easy to see yourself,

366
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,660
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

367
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,870
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

368
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:51,700
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

369
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,910
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

370
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,450
What is your behaviour?

371
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,910
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

372
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,450
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

373
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,290
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

374
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,740
Absolutely stupid.

375
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,540
And when they are doing stupid things,

376
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,580
why should we bother about them?

377
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,700
Why should we waste our energy about them?

378
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:35,620
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

379
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,290
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

380
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,330
they are treated with contempt.

381
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,990
People don’t even want to take their names,

382
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,620
they don’t want to have their photographs,

383
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,740
they don’t want to have anything to do with them.

384
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,580
At this time, at such a juncture,

385
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,700
what happens is the people who are crooks,

386
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:13,490
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

387
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,910
they start following them because it suits them better.

388
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,910
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

389
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,660
and that’s how a new group is formed –

390
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,910
which we can call ‘a satanic group’.

391
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,990
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

392
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,330
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

393
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,990
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

394
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,410
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

395
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,330
‘It cannot be killed by any weapon’.

396
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,450
Nainam dahanti pavaka – ‘No fire can burn it’.

397
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,580
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

398
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:09,490
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

399
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,330
‘Wind cannot also suck it’,

400
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,580
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

401
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,450
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

402
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,870
I told you, nature is innocent.

403
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,580
It understands and it acts

404
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:37,370
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

405
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:44,950
who is trying to malign

406
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,330
or trouble an innocent person.

407
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,620
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

408
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,660
I know sometimes one feels

409
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,330
that you are dominated because of that.

410
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,870
Sometimes one feels sad that  ‘Why you are put to this kind

411
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,410
of a treatment by others’.

412
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,370
All kinds of things come to your mind.

413
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,540
But if you worship your innocence,

414
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,830
then you will be always a happy person,

415
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,330
always a kind person, always be humble person.

416
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,870
So, one has to be careful.

417
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,990
You are your own destroyer!

418
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,830
You are the one who kills, you see

419
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,990
What do you say to it?

420
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,990
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

421
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,740
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

422
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,740
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

423
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,330
So, you kill yourself –

424
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,410
through this you can save yourself

425
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,410
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

426
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,620
Have faith in the power of innocence.

427
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,410
What is important is, how you show in your own life

428
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,990
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

429
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,990
and that is what is what, is what I call ‘the love’.

430
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,450
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

431
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,580
you have this attitude towards yourself.

432
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,580
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

433
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,740
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

434
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,700
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

435
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,450
through your character.

436
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,950
It’s such a transparent thing in a human being

437
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,950
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

438
00:39:53,450 --> 00:40:00,410
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

439
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,870
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

440
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,290
and your strength of your innocence.

441
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,990
I’m sorry for today’s programme being so late,

442
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,660
but you know I was ready to come

443
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:26,830
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

444
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,450
Because it came so late,

445
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,410
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

446
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,370
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we’ll stop it.

447
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,580
You must send your applications

448
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:52,290
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

449
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:59,490
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

450
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,870
and you cannot increase those!

451
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,450
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

452
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,330
that if you want to settle your marriage,

453
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:18,990
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

454
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,620
Otherwise I’ll leave it to others to decide.

455
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,950
If you like, it can be done.

456
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,450
So a simple thing is this to understand,

457
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,290
that marriage is a very important thing.

458
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,950
You can create innocent children if you are married.

459
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,990
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

460
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:47,990
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

461
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,290
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

462
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,790
if you send your applications so late.

463
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,870
It should be within one week’s time,

464
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,660
I hope you’ll understand that.

465
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,290
Thank you very much.
