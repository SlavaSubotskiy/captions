1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,119
his musicians all of them are so young

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,789
we must have seen and one is a blind

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,019
fellow and with realization they became

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,570
so dynamic so now they want to play for

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,140
me and sing for me because they got it

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,689
too you see

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,120
and the one who has composed it was a

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,280
chartered accountant he never knew and

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,430
is any do or renew

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:01:03,660
I mean political language but he's

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:01:06,479
become appointed emotional music and

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,939
musical devotional music is sung by

13
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,170
people who are realized Souls reaches

14
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:19,890
your heart reaches your Kundalini and

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,450
helps a lot awaken them so if there are

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,869
these are all realized Souls so where

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,130
there the dancer everybody the dancer

18
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,259
was playing the rhythm and the rhythm it

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,360
is a divine rhythm because she is now

20
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,780
become a realized soul she's connected

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,240
with the divine so when she dances she

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,170
creates her divine rhythm and when these

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,420
people sing

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,850
they also sing a divine devotion

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,640
otherwise without connection if you sing

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,009
the praise of God it doesn't reach God

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,619
because you are not connected like a

28
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,780
telephone which is not connected if you

29
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,329
start telephoning your telephone gets

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,310
spot so for devotion also you should be

31
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,890
connected with God so as they're

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,869
connected with the divine the music

33
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,970
image

34
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,910
vibrations what to call the divine

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,370
vibration as a result it creates an

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,920
atmosphere for people to receive the

37
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,170
realization it becomes much easier for

38
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,500
me to give realization because that

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,010
masseur cleanser rinses out and people

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,950
also get ready for realization because

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,280
they're realized Souls all of them so

42
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,720
this is the reason why I was very happy

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
they could manage to come they're all

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,780
professionals and they have agreed to

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,590
come here and do it further just to help

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,989
me in sahaja yoga and also you will be

47
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,580
surprised that this music is very

48
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,220
difficult indeed music is a very

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,470
difficult music it's not easy for people

50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,030
to sing unless until you go into big

51
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,940
practices but it's so amazing that when

52
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,790
people get realization all these people

53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,310
who are Western are people from 40

54
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,489
countries they all can sing these songs

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,160
with same depth and with same

56
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,890
understanding without making any

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,549
mistakes even in pronunciation otherwise

58
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,630
it is so difficult to pronounce a state

59
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:21,959
even Indian language is so difficult

60
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,500
that they could not even pronounce a one

61
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,780
sentence property and now the whole song

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,090
is has to song any song this thing's

63
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,560
over and you if you close your eyes you

64
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,540
won't believe that they are foreigners

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,350
who are singing who have never known

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,940
this language so something has gone

67
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,380
dynamically new in them that they just

68
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,380
pick it up and sing so well

69
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,910
of course very much music is is is a

70
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,220
divine gift to human beings it's a

71
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,760
divine we call it starts with Omkara

72
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,830
means the first word is that was we call

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,230
as locusts it starts with that and

74
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,360
that's that's a proof of it because the

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,880
when they get their realization how is

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,720
it they know such difficult language and

77
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,989
such difficult tunes and so correctly as

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,600
they can see it's very surprising so

79
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:24,010
music is a very inner part dancing music

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,560
all art is very kind much connected with

81
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,270
the divine now we have had many artists

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
who have been realized Souls because a

83
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,920
Michelangelo was a realized soul and the

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:41,260
way he painted hence it emits vibrations

85
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:43,570
you see if you see Mona Lisa and by they

86
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,990
are not of the wind say it has

87
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,090
vibrations it gives you abrasions those

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,400
people who were realized Souls like

89
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,800
Mozart when you play Mozart you get

90
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,620
vibrations out of it you can feel them

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,110
on your fingertips you can feel so there

92
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,110
are musicians who are realized Souls

93
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,210
also artists also people like Abraham

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,420
Lincoln was a realized soul Gorbachev is

95
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,520
realized so he's also a sage so when

96
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,290
these people are there how will you make

97
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,090
them out and she was asking me you have

98
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,320
to just put your hands towards them and

99
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,320
you can feel it
