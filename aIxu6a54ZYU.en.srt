1
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:22,550
in the West we have become very speedy

2
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:36,460
no doubt and to bring down the spell

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:36,460
speed we have to use meditative process

4
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,870
that we feel our peace within ourselves

5
00:00:48,220 --> 00:01:03,300
also the thoughts are bombarding our

6
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:03,300
minds and we react very fast

7
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:23,240
to others and to these thoughts so one

8
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:27,729
has to be aware one has to be knowing

9
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,729
what is happening within yourself that

10
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:44,119
the thoughts are bombarding you you are

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:53,929
trying to ascend and you find it very

12
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:59,840
difficult to get rid of the thoughts the

13
00:01:53,929 --> 00:02:02,899
thought process can start by your

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,380
conditioning or by your ego only two

15
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,380
problems

16
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,360
and you are the one who is under the

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,360
challenge

18
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:30,840
so you have got these simple people in

19
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:39,599
the village who start watching

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:43,920
everything but they do not react if you

21
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:51,959
do not react then your thoughts will

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:58,340
give up so the first thing should be to

23
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,340
watch yourself that you are not reacting

24
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:11,280
but you are are experiencing and

25
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:17,879
enjoying the silence the subtleties the

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:25,590
beauty the glory of your being as well

27
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:33,090
as whatever is around you don't have to

28
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:37,370
force yourself to break this habit but

29
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,370
just to be on the watch out

30
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:58,010
it's not necessary to talk too much

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:04:03,500
about it also not it is necessary to

32
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:08,290
think about anything because supposing

33
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:12,980
you see a tree soul it's a tree only

34
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:15,170
what are we going to think about it and

35
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:22,070
whatever we may think about it it's

36
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:24,470
going to be the tree so there's no harm

37
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,820
in appearing little bit stupid doesn't

38
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:34,190
matter but this is the basic thing is

39
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:41,900
that when we start analyzing we are

40
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:50,960
breaking our own nerves and poisoning

41
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:54,650
our own mind and brain so to watch

42
00:04:50,960 --> 00:05:02,870
something without analysis without

43
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:04,970
thinking about it is reality if you can

44
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:09,440
achieve that point where you watch

45
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,010
everything without reacting you are in

46
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,010
relative

47
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:28,639
and then only the penetration into the

48
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:35,990
subtleties of your surroundings of your

49
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:45,620
relationships your friendships the whole

50
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:49,960
universe dance upon you so to judge

51
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:56,960
others to think of others what they are

52
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:59,090
doing what's wrong with them about

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,130
anything whatsoever

54
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:09,950
you may think is wrong he's not going to

55
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:13,310
be corrected like I know some people who

56
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:18,020
are specially bureaucrats they are

57
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:21,770
traveling supposing by the car then they

58
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,510
will say I think you see this road

59
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,400
should have gone this way or I think it

60
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:34,340
would have been nice if this house was

61
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:39,110
facing the other way but it's not see it

62
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:43,099
is not going to face it is going to be

63
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:47,270
the way it is so what is the use of

64
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:50,570
wasting your brain your mind your

65
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:55,940
thought in suggesting thump something

66
00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:01,310
which doesn't work out and never going

67
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:06,710
to work out either so when we start like

68
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:10,900
I think these trees should have been a

69
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,900
little taller but they are not

70
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,260
I think

71
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:33,550
that the crows should stop their noise

72
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:39,409
they will not so just accept it

73
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:44,180
acceptance is the way we are going to

74
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:46,729
enjoy but acceptance doesn't mean

75
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:52,400
tolerance because tolerance means you

76
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:55,729
have to work very hard to accept that

77
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,060
the trees are of the same height they

78
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:01,129
can't grow it's too much worry and you

79
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,199
say I have to tolerate it you see

80
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,199
because my mind doesn't accept

81
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:19,439
so acceptance as it is whatever you see

82
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:21,659
acceptance and that is how people grow I

83
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:25,879
have seen those who start accepting

84
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:30,059
that's the sign that's the sign of their

85
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,899
strength and their depth like the

86
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:44,009
propensity of this mother earth she is

87
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:52,649
what she is and she bears whatever is

88
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:54,990
there if you put a heavy thing on her

89
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,009
she'll put equal and opposite force and

90
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:03,589
wear it she doesn't say I'm tolerating

91
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:13,500
it I am exerting any pressure

92
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:17,850
she's just accepting so the witnessing

93
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:23,959
and awareness develops when we start

94
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:27,410
just accepting things as they're I think

95
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:27,410
don't work

96
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:40,339
I think it would have been better like

97
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:48,410
this doesn't work out then second

98
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:55,639
problem is I like now I like to eat a

99
00:09:48,410 --> 00:10:02,149
cake but there is no cake what to do now

100
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:05,980
whatever is there enjoy it as a cake but

101
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:10,339
if you go on thinking like that I like

102
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:15,319
whatever is not here you can never be

103
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:23,930
happy as simple as that you have to say

104
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:27,470
I like whatever is there I enjoy

105
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:34,880
whatever is there there that's the

106
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:47,149
reality whatever doesn't exist if you

107
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:50,569
like it so what can anybody do about it

108
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:58,939
works out in so many ways in so many

109
00:10:50,569 --> 00:11:00,740
facets in life that advantage is taken

110
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:03,470
by people because we become so

111
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,569
vulnerable to our likes and dislikes

112
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:10,610
that the enterpreneur take over and they

113
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:15,649
create likes and dislikes in our heads

114
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:18,740
and put ideas every day I've seen it now

115
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,910
how they do it through television

116
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:28,819
through newspaper there is that so then

117
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:33,290
you say now I like this but from where

118
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:37,269
this liking has come is the conditioning

119
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,269
which is put into her head

120
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,710
so you are a slave of that condition I

121
00:11:49,470 --> 00:12:04,480
only like roses and I don't like any

122
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:15,060
other flower why why you don't like any

123
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:15,060
other flower and for such things

124
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:31,500
whatever we have we miss the joy so the

125
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:31,500
second part should be that enjoyability

126
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:49,550
why am I here it's not a very

127
00:12:42,890 --> 00:13:02,990
comfortable place by any chance so why

128
00:12:49,550 --> 00:13:07,910
am I here to enjoy each other to enjoy

129
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:11,510
your own being the more divergence you

130
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:16,910
have outside appealing to your ego and

131
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:30,790
conditioning the more your mind is busy

132
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:30,790
with that then you cannot enjoy anything
