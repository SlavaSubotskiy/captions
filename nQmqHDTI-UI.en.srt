1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,250
Today we are going to celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,990
At a very crucial time we are doing that,

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,160
because there are some anti-Christ

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,700
who have become in charge of the Christian religion

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,120
and are talking against the birth of Christ.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,830
They have no authority, they are not realized souls,

7
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,540
they have no idea of the Divine, nothing,

8
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,870
and they are saying that it is all falsehood

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,580
that She was not a virgin

10
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,950
and that Christ was not born that way.

11
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,910
Who told them? Did Gabriel come and told them?

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,330
What right they have got to talk these things?

13
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,160
So because they are anti-Christ now they have become

14
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:29,370
in charge of Christianity. Even Pope is like that.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,990
So in Satya Yuga they will be all exposed,

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,790
have to be exposed. But some people who are here,

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,870
can write to this man to ask, "What is your authority to say?

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,410
Have you felt the allpervading power of God's love?

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,620
Have you any divinity in you to challenge Christ like that?"

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,700
There must be some incarnations of Paul perhaps.

21
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,080
They cannot understand Divine.

22
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,330
They don't know what Divine can do.

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,500
They have no idea at all, how miraculous it is.

24
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,750
You all have felt the blessings of the Divine.

25
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,040
You all know that it is a miracle.

26
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,410
Every time there's a miracle produced.

27
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,370
I will narrate one simple example.

28
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,370
In the Navaratri Puja we had some photographs.

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,250
And behind the photograph some sort of a scene came

30
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,410
which I was wondering what is this is supposed to be.

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,370
The scene was that

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,540
the Surya was

33
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,580
moving a curtain.

34
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,290
Eyes of the, there were eyes for the Surya, mouth, nose

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,540
and He was smiling and moving a curtain like that.

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,620
I said, "What is this?

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,910
What this is indicative in the Navaratri Puja?

38
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,080
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised,

39
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,290
that they had painted the background just like this.

40
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,290
Exactly like this there was the background.

41
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,660
So Navaratri Puja, which took at least one and a half month before,

42
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,330
the Paramchaitanya painted there.

43
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,200
It's very remarkable,

44
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,910
how things work out miraculously.

45
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,870
And there are thousand and one miracles we can talk about.

46
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,160
When we were in the aeroplane, going to Moscow

47
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,700
they said the temperature is minus twenty.

48
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,990
We got down, they said it is minus fifteen.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,830
Next morning they said it is coming down very fast,

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,370
is touching about minus twelve.

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,990
And after one day they said it is minus four.

52
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
But next day it was plus ten.

53
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,370
I mean as the time passes,

54
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,290
it has to be cooler and cooler.

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,620
This time My husband was going to Moscow.

56
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,830
He said, "It's very cold there now, minus twenty".

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,290
He sent word that... I said, "Don't worry, it will put it right".

58
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,990
He said when he arrived it was only minus two.

59
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,160
So all these things show that all the elements are helping us.

60
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,080
All the

61
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:00,950
other problems, minor, big, anything, get solved in no time.

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,790
You are sometimes amazed how things are done.

63
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,580
So then they question, "Then why Christ had to be crucified?

64
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,950
Why could You not save Him from crucifixion?"

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,080
He was crucified because that was to be done in His case,

66
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,790
that He had to pass through the Agya,

67
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,080
He had to establish Himself in Agya,

68
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,990
and the cross, He had to pass through that.

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,580
So the message of His Life is never the cross,

70
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,990
but the message is His Resurrection.

71
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,160
He resurrected - that was one of the things He did very great -

72
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,700
so that now you can be resurrected also.

73
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,330
In every incarnation, in the evolution,

74
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,790
every incarnation did something very, very unique.

75
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,120
At the end of it, Christ, did the Resurrection part.

76
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,950
And He did it because He had to die,

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,540
otherwise how can you resurrect yourself?

78
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,290
So there are lots of things which look mythical, which are not.

79
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,410
Tomorrow they'll say that Christ never resurrected Himself.

80
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,910
And actually He died later on in Kashmir.

81
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,580
There's a proof of it.

82
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,580
But still the people don't want to believe,

83
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,750
and they just wanted to spread Christianity,

84
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,540
because they know that if you have majority of people

85
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,370
then they can rule.

86
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,750
The same trick now is tried by politicians.

87
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,870
But this kind of a majority is not going to bring any solace

88
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,200
or any benevolence for people.

89
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,990
Christ's Mother Herself has been challenged by this man

90
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,990
and said all kinds of nonsense about Her.

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,990
On the contrary Mohammad Sahib in Quran says

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,540
nobody should challenge the chastity

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,120
of the Holy Mother, of Christ's Mother.

94
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,450
He has respected,

95
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,660
while there is no respect shown to Mother Mary

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,080
in the Bible, no respect. She's called "a woman".

97
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,870
Because of Paul

98
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,080
who was a horrible anti-Christ  who came over,

99
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,700
who took over Christianity, tried to spread Christianity

100
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,910
and with that what he wanted, to put his own importance.

101
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,450
And he used Peter

102
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,700
who was the worst possible disciple of Christ,

103
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:49,910
whom Christ has told that, "Satan will take you over".

104
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,160
So now,

105
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,290
they are telling people that, "It's impossible, how can it be

106
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,500
that Christ was born to a virgin?"

107
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,450
We  Indians  worship Shri Ganesh.

108
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,830
Shri Ganesh is the same as Christ,

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,790
and we believe that the Mother Herself created the Child

110
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,790
without, as a Virgin, as a Gauri.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,080
Not only believe but we, it's our faith.

112
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,370
While the faith in the West  is all rationality.

113
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,700
They go on thinking like that

114
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,200
and they go on producing yarn of falsehood.

115
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,870
What was the need for newspapers

116
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,660
to publish this nonsense of this Dharam fellow?

117
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,790
And then he was honored,

118
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,790
honored by the archbishop of Canterbury, who is another anti-Christ.

119
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,750
He honored him and just after that,

120
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,830
that church where he was honored,

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,700
was completely burned by Vishnumaya.

122
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,330
She was looming round it for one hour

123
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,370
and then She burn it completely.

124
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,160
Only the lower portion was left

125
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,160
because there were also very beautiful paintings, maybe.

126
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,750
Now the stupid fools are saying

127
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,790
that,  "it is God's grace on us that they saved us,

128
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,290
from this Vishnumaya, the lower portion of it".

129
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,290
But way did it burn?

130
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,700
So you have to understand that rationality can never

131
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,000
make you understand Divinity, can never.

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,950
It is so limited, so conditioned, full of ego.

133
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,620
How can the rationality

134
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,750
tell you what is the truth about Christ's life.

135
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:03,620
But we have proof also, scientifically.

136
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,660
So you must be knowing that

137
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,790
I told them that  if you see from right to the left

138
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,750
you see a swastika.

139
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,500
Because of carbon, the way it is made.

140
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,330
If you see the carbon atom, you see a swastika from left to right.

141
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,910
We have made a big model out of it.

142
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,830
And then you put

143
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,120
it in other way, means you see it from left to the right,

144
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,790
then you see Omkara, no doubt.

145
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,660
And then you see from down below, you see Alpha and Omega.

146
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,410
Christ has said it that ,"I am the Alpha and the Omega".

147
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,330
At that time I did know if these symbols were there or not.

148
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,160
Whatever it is, He did say, "I am the Alpha and the Omega".

149
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,410
Also it has another meaning

150
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,580
that "I am the beginning, I am the end".

151
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,120
But Alpha and Omega

152
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,370
the way He said it, you can see it clearly, symbolically,

153
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,200
clearly, if you see it from down upward.

154
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,700
So, the Omkara on one side, swastika on another side

155
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,540
join together when they ascend and incarnate,

156
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,700
they become Alpha and Omega.

157
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,870
But all these doesn't going to the heads of these anti-Christs.

158
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,330
They are all anti-Christ.

159
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,290
And they can not understand what Divinity can do.

160
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,370
You got your Realization, your second birth

161
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,000
just sitting here. How did you manage?

162
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,790
How did you get your second birth?

163
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,790
And the way these people talk

164
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,580
is definitely for their doom,

165
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,330
for their complete destruction.

166
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,370
It's too much of daring, as you know that

167
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Shri Ganesha is a very powerful

168
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,040
deity.

169
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,370
Same Christ.

170
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,870
He has said, "If you say anything against the Holy Ghost,

171
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,290
I will not tolerate".

172
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,950
And also, against Christ I will not tolerate,

173
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,830
a word even.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,040
Only on that point I'll have to see to it,

175
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,120
that all these horrible people, should be destroyed completely.

176
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,410
On this occasion of His birthday we have to realize

177
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,040
that Christ was born

178
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,040
from same things as Shri Ganesh.

179
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,290
So He was wisdom, source of wisdom.

180
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,830
He said few things because they didn't allow him to live long,

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,450
at the most three of,

182
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,250
three and a half years He could lecture to people.

183
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:11,450
But whatever He said is so truthful, so correct  and so wise.

184
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,750
Of course they might have tried to dabble with that

185
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,160
but still lots of truths are left in the Bible, no doubt about it.

186
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,870
And His lifetime He spent

187
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,620
in just telling them what is the truth is.

188
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,620
He is the first one

189
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,330
who talked so clearly about God.

190
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,870
On His level we have three other people,

191
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,080
in the area of tapa which is here.

192
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,450
One is Buddha, another is Mahavira.

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,540
Now, both Buddha and Mahavira were born at a time when they saw

194
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,370
that ritualism is taking place the reality.

195
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,000
So they said, "We'll not talk of God, Anishwarwad.

196
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,330
We'll not talk of God". First we'll only talk about the Chaitanya.

197
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,990
That everybody did.

198
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,540
Even the Guru of Janaka,

199
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,250
who was Ashtavakra, only talked about the vibrations.

200
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,200
Even Nanaka did that.

201
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,790
When Namadeva went down to Punjab,

202
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,750
He told him, "Don't talk about God, don't talk about Hari,

203
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,750
better talk about Paramachaitanya, first of all",

204
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,000
because one can reach only Paramachaitanya to begin with

205
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,910
and then they will say, "Where is God after all"?

206
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,950
But it's only Christ who talked

207
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,790
about God at that time when it was more,

208
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,910
that they didn't want to talk about God Almighty.

209
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,990
He was a daring person, was never afraid of anything, no doubt.

210
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,080
But His childhood has not been described anywhere,

211
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,700
which is very sad.

212
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,120
We have got the beautiful description of Shri Krishna's childhood

213
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,410
and also Shri Rama's childhood.

214
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,910
Except that once He was in argument with some Pharisees,

215
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,950
and how clever He was,

216
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,200
and they were all flabbergasted at His discretion.

217
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,370
That's all, nothing more. But later on,

218
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,580
though that had shown no regard for Mary,

219
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,200
the people couldn't help it. They said,

220
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,870
"There has to be some Devi, some Goddess.

221
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,250
How can Christ take birth from Her?"

222
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,290
So they named Her Madonna,

223
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,000
and that's how this Mother Mary was called as Madonna,

224
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,700
means maiden, means virgin.

225
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,790
And this Madonna was then started occupying

226
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,950
the place of our churches everywhere,

227
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,080
and people regarded Her as a, as a Goddess.

228
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,910
It is the people who said, not in the Bible, not in the Christianity

229
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,660
but the people start calling Her, Madonna,

230
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,500
and from that Madonna level

231
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,700
that people starting seeing the Mother

232
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,790
and the motherhood.

233
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,200
She was Mahalakshmi, we know that very well

234
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,950
and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi.

235
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,660
She was Radha. Radha also had a Son

236
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,040
and He was like an egg

237
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,790
and a half of the egg was Christ

238
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,000
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh.

239
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,330
But when this Child was born He started crying for His Father.

240
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,120
Father was Shri Krishna.

241
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,080
It's in the... if you read Devi Mahatmyam it is there.

242
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,910
So always He puts His hands like this, towards His Father.

243
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,990
So one is, as you know, is Shri Krishna's finger,

244
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,870
another is Vishnu's.

245
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,660
And She was Radha.

246
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,540
Ra means energy, dha means the one who has sustained the energy.

247
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,750
And She is the One, who called Him Jesus.

248
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,330
Actually in the Hebrew it is Yesu

249
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,700
and also in the - thank God I read Bible in Marathi,

250
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,200
which was directly translated from Hebrew -

251
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,370
Yesu is the name.

252
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,790
Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ,

253
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,830
Mother of Shri Krishna.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,910
Yesu, means as we call Her

255
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,290
Jesu or Yesu from Jesoda or Yeshoda.

256
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,990
From that She called Him, and Christ word comes from Krishna.

257
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,330
So She call Him Christ

258
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,990
and Yesu or Jesus.

259
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,540
We too call Yeshoda sometimes Jesu or Yesu.

260
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,080
So She called Him by that name

261
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,160
and that is how She put the link for us to understand

262
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,700
how close He was to Shri Krishna.

263
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,200
Shri Krisha came only, incarnated only in India

264
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,620
because He would have been

265
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,290
too lenient person to be incarnated in America.

266
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,040
As it is they have no limitations, they have no maryadas,

267
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,540
they have no idea of dharma, they are very great adharmis.

268
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,450
So only a person like Christ

269
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,330
who is absolutely pure, wise,

270
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,990
and does not believe

271
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,540
in the leela part of Shri Krishna.

272
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,040
Is Shri Krishna said that is this all leela

273
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,580
to overcome the strictness of Shri Rama.

274
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,790
But Christ did not said so

275
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,500
and despite that, all over wherever Christianity is practiced,

276
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,500
they think it's all leela, adharma is leela,

277
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,910
whatever wrong we do is leela, after all, all innocent.

278
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,790
It's surprising. Their logic is so funny

279
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,620
I've never been able to understand their logic.

280
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,410
All self-destructive, nonsensical logic they have.

281
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,450
So, for us Indians, we should know that we have

282
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,450
full idea of dharma. We know what is wrong and what is good.

283
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,330
But more credit I would give to Christians,

284
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,870
who are from such countries where they have no idea of Kundalini,

285
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,580
have come up so much

286
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,950
and have become such great Sahaja Yogis.

287
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,250
Now is the blessing of God,

288
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,250
because they were genuine, they were sincere.

289
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,870
It is Christ who brought them to Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,830
Without Him it would not have been possible.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,990
Here Shri Ganesha is just a symbol, sort of a thing.

292
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,540
He resides in the stones.

293
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,250
But there He incarnated and He told people what is dharma is,

294
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,830
which they are supposed to follow, but they never follow.

295
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,200
They never follow. They are extremely money oriented people.

296
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Is very surprising what things they have done in the name of God.

297
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,040
The most symbolic thing is His birth.

298
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,250
He was born in a manger,

299
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,120
just imagine, in a manger,

300
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,830
full of straws assembled together

301
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,160
this child was born,

302
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,870
where there were other animals used to be.

303
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,990
See the way

304
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,950
this great incarnation took birth.

305
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,040
He was not king, he was not a big rich man,

306
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,750
He was born as a very poor person

307
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,910
and in a place which is something very much

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,750
below the human standard.

309
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,990
This message is, that you don't need palaces,

310
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,870
you don't need huge places to be born,

311
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,290
you can be born anywhere, if you are a pure Spirit,

312
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,910
if you are Christ.

313
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,870
Such a great personality was born like that.

314
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,790
Now the other way round people go.

315
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,160
They are extremely money oriented, very materialistic.

316
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,330
I mean to such a limit

317
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,120
that you can't understand what  are they up to.

318
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,790
They are destroying themselves with whatever money they have made,

319
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,290
they have no sense, they have no proportion.

320
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,990
This is what is happening in the West,

321
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,000
and we are trying to follow them also.

322
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,250
We are trying to follow their destructive methods

323
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,540
and we are trying to think that we are very advanced.

324
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,160
Advanced towards doom, that's what they are.

325
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,330
We have to be very careful with our children,

326
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,990
with our relations, that we don't go to their dirty things

327
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,410
and take to their dirty ways,

328
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,200
which they have created in the name of God, in the name of God.

329
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Now this group that we have here, is quite a large group,

330
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,700
and we are Sahaja Yogis

331
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,750
we are all blessed people,

332
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,450
we know what is Divinity is

333
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,250
and we know what Christ is.

334
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,370
Whether you are born Hindu or anything, makes no difference,

335
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,620
because Christ is universal.

336
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,250
He's the support of universe,

337
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,080
that's what is written in Devi Mahatmyam

338
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,870
ki ("that" in Hindi) He will be the support of the universe.

339
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,660
So one has to understand

340
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,620
that we should never ridicule anybody, if he is following Christ

341
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,500
and that we should worship Him with the same affection,

342
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,750
with the same devotion, with the same surrendering,

343
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,200
as we worship Shri Ganesh.

344
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,790
Because I don't think Christians

345
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,370
have any faith about Christ, no faith.

346
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,370
They are, "We believe in Christ, we believe in Christ.

347
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,660
You cure my father, do this, do that".

348
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,160
But as Sahaja Yogis' faith works.

349
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,790
Your faith is an enlightened faith and it works.

350
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,620
But you must have faith in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga,

351
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,120
and in the life you are leading.

352
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,250
Unless and until this happens to you

353
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,040
you shouldn't call yourself a Sahaja Yogi.

354
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,750
I see, still there are people on the periphery.

355
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,200
Then you don't know what to do about it,

356
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,950
you don't understand in a mental way,

357
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,040
but you just float into the immense love of God

358
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,790
and you want to give this love to others.

359
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,580
But still, materialism becomes subtler with some people.

360
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,790
They are still materialistic.

361
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,750
They are materialistic in the sense,

362
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,990
they still think of earning in a bad way some money or something.

363
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,450
Maybe, but that is not so common.

364
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,580
But I feel they are now

365
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,000
suddenly started getting attached to their children.

366
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,830
This attachment is very wrong.

367
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,950
You see, children belong to Sahaja Yoga. You have no right on them.

368
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,540
Because they straight away wanted children to come back home

369
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,790
and not to come to Ganapatipule.

370
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,580
Means they are children of Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,160
They have to come to Ganapatipule, no question.

372
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,620
But they wanted to take over their children directly.

373
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,540
Everything is there, directly done.

374
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,990
Is not, children are not here for that.

375
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,160
They are here to grow in Sahaja Yoga. If you don't want

376
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,910
your children to grow in Sahaja Yoga, better take them away.

377
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,790
But this is not the way to behave arbitrarily,

378
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,080
to take the children away from the school,

379
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,200
when everybody is coming to Ganapatipule.

380
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,620
And I'm sure children don't like it.

381
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,040
They would love to be here.

382
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,000
So the materialism in the sense of children,

383
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,660
also saving money part is working out.

384
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,950
And this is, something shows the materialism,

385
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,370
which Christ never, never clung to.

386
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,750
He never wanted it.

387
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,660
This one we have to understand.

388
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,080
To pay respect to Christ the best thing

389
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,950
is to get out of this materialistic ideas.

390
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,000
All right, you have materialistic ideas

391
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,040
as far as I don't say that you don't go to Himalayas,

392
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,990
I don't say that you go to, you,

393
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,830
you practice asceticism,

394
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,120
I don't say take away, give up your children, like Buddha did.

395
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,910
Nothing of the kind.

396
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,620
But your detachment should work.

397
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,040
There's a, say a bird is there, flying over the ocean of water.

398
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,120
It will never drink the water of the ocean, because it is saltish.

399
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,500
You are there, you are in this world,

400
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,580
but you must develop your detachment.

401
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,990
In the beginning it was all right, "my father is sick",

402
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,990
"my mother is sick", "my child is like this",

403
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,330
all this nonsense was all right. But not now.

404
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,500
Now the speed of Sahaja Yoga is very fast

405
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,950
and those will be left behind, will be left behind. So be careful.

406
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,620
Do not get entangled into these materialistic ideas.

407
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,620
And for Indians especially, they don't like to stay in ashrams.

408
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,200
Indians want to have their homes, so they can dominate their wives,

409
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,990
have their special type of food, this, that, and

410
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,120
work out all their ugly tastes all the time.

411
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,250
I would say that's must be the reason people must have said

412
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:58,450
that Indians must fast, to get rid of their tongues, desires.

413
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,290
They will, even when fast, think about food, what's the use?

414
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,620
Christ fasted for forty days

415
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,370
and Satan asked Him that, "You should give up Your fast

416
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,040
and do this and do that". He never listened.

417
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,580
So materialism works out in two types.

418
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,200
First of all in the West now is the materialism is "my house",

419
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,080
"my wife", "my children", this that.

420
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,540
And in the East is, "what sort of a food I eat",

421
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,620
"what sort of a house I should have",

422
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,080
"what sort of a family I should have?"

423
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,500
All these things are still lingering.

424
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,410
As your ascent has become subtler

425
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,580
they are also becoming subtler and subtler.

426
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,790
And they are holding you back.

427
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,790
There are all kinds of things. For example I know of Sahaja Yogis,

428
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:07,870
who want to make business out of Sahaja Yoga, there are.

429
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,870
Like these people here, outside,

430
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,830
they want to sell their things to us

431
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,040
and to make money out of this.

432
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,450
There was a demand that there were no saris.

433
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,540
I said, "All right, take saris. But you are not to buy from outside".

434
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,700
Also they will go to some shop here,

435
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,910
and have something to drink, or something to eat,

436
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
and then suffer from something.

437
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,120
What is the need? Can you not control your thirst?

438
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,120
Can you not control your appetite?

439
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,160
It's very easy. Did He not do it? Christ did it.

440
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,410
You have come here to worship Him.

441
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,580
Try to control these things are very important,

442
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,580
and once it happens,

443
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,830
it doesn't matter if you get food, doesn't matter,

444
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,120
if you don't get some good place to live in.

445
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,830
You can live anywhere, anywhere.

446
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,410
As far as I am concerned, you know that very well.

447
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,540
I have no demands. I have, I mean My body doesn't demand anything.

448
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,910
Is such a good body. Never demands.

449
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,700
And that's why I have seen, that I never feel tired.

450
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,370
I am here with you and in the same way I am anywhere.

451
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,450
If you make Me sleep here I can sleep the whole night.

452
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,990
My body never says anything.

453
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,910
On the contrary I've seen the experience is very different.

454
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,160
Once I travelled by train,

455
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,700
I think from Pune to Hyderabad or something,

456
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,990
and the train - I was on the wheel -

457
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,250
and the thing was jumping, jumping, jumping all the time.

458
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,990
I slept off and what I was feeling,

459
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,580
that I am going from one star to another star,

460
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,370
moving from the whole universe.

461
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,500
I never felt the jump, I felt the other way round,

462
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,200
that the whole thing is going, the body is moving

463
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,660
from this star to that star, from there to there.

464
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,160
I mean somebody would be absolutely angry for a thing like that.

465
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,200
On the contrary, I was enjoying, nice jumping from here to there

466
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,500
to go into this star and to that star and

467
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,910
moving from one place to another. It was very interesting.

468
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,580
So the reaction is very different.

469
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,950
Reaction is different. If there is a crisis,

470
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,620
suddenly I become thoughtless, completely thoughtless.

471
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:38,620
And a kind of a tremendous peace starts pouring out of it.

472
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,620
If there is a crisis.

473
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,040
And this is what you all can achieve very simply,

474
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,830
if you get detached.

475
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,910
See, I have children, I have grandchildren.

476
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,620
I never telephone to them.

477
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,990
I'm not bothered. If they telephone, well and good.

478
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,580
I never telephone to my husband also.

479
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:03,040
I always think that it's a waste of time.

480
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,200
of telephoning here and telephoning...

481
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,330
I've got all telephones within Myself.

482
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,250
I know everybody is all right so why to telephone to them.

483
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,580
But unless and until you develop that kind of status it won't [work].

484
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,700
Then another thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis

485
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,700
that they become suddenly very violent

486
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,290
and there are reports that some people were hit.

487
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,700
That's not being a Sahaja Yogi at all.

488
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,870
I've never raise My hand against even My own children.

489
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,660
It's not allowed. Nobody has to raise the hand

490
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,330
or touch somebody's body to be violent.

491
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,500
It's absolutely, such a person will fall very deep down,

492
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,830
into Sahaja Yoga, without doing anything.

493
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,990
You are not to get angry, you are not to shout.

494
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,540
Nothing of the kind is going to help you.

495
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,290
You have to be absolutely peaceful, calm, compassionate.

496
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,990
If there is a wrong type of a man, just tell Me, I'll manage.

497
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,040
You don't have to handle such situations and misbehave,

498
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,790
because you are still attached,

499
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,580
and that attachment will pull you down.

500
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,790
So be careful, not to be angry.

501
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,910
Look at Christ!

502
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,750
He was angry with the people who were selling things

503
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,080
near the church - you know, that time it was not the church,

504
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,160
but they called it a tabernacle.

505
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,160
And He was very angry, that in the temple of God,

506
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,750
these people are selling things outside,

507
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,580
and He took a big hunter and hit them hard. But He was Christ.

508
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,910
But at the same time, when He was crucified,

509
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,580
He said, "Oh God, My Father, please forgive them,

510
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,790
because they don't know what they are doing".

511
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,330
This is what is, one has to understand from Him.

512
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,160
His character, how forgiving, how loving He was.

513
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,540
How He looked after the people,

514
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,330
how He helped people for their emancipation.

515
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,000
In those days of complete chaos

516
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,540
and anarchy,

517
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,700
He stood up and talked about truth and about

518
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:21,660
such things like Spirit, like ascent.

519
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,950
I mean, they were all blind people.

520
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,950
They didn't know what it was He was talking about.

521
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,660
And He talked about it.

522
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:34,370
There is lot of myths that exist in the Bible,

523
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,910
and one of them is that when the Resurrection time will come

524
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,040
your bodies will come out of your graves.

525
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:48,080
It is not only with Christianity, but also with the Muslims

526
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,450
and also for the Jews.

527
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,000
Now think of it, after so many years, what remains in the,

528
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,620
in the graves? Few bones.

529
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,910
And these few bones if they come out,

530
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,790
how can you give them Realization?

531
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,450
Think of it. It's a big myth.

532
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,080
One should understand, logically is not proper.

533
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,790
So what is the thing is, I must say,

534
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,950
in Nal-Damyanti Akhiyan (Indian Scripture)

535
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,000
in Indian philosophy they have given a clear-cut idea,

536
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,450
that when this Kali Yuga will come,

537
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,990
so many great seekers who are seeking God

538
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,160
in the hills and dales, mountains,

539
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,290
will be born again

540
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,450
and they will be given their Self Realization.

541
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,540
Their Kundalini will be awaken.

542
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,330
This is what is said and that seems to be

543
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,500
a very logical thing, because we are doing that.

544
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,790
And today's population growth is also because

545
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,750
so many have taken birth.

546
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,790
I don't know how many will get their Self Realization,

547
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,790
how many they are going to get it.

548
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,500
But those who have got it

549
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,540
have to establish themselves, establish themselves.

550
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,500
And there also I find there's some sort of a very

551
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,950
subtle type of attachment with people.

552
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,040
So for the time being I feel

553
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,620
that you should all surrender yourself to the qualities of Christ,

554
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,700
which are immense qualities.

555
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,250
And the greatest is that He cannot tolerate

556
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,750
anything against the Holy Ghost.

557
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,370
That is the only time He is going to come out and work it.

558
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,500
I tell you, if you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you misbehave,

559
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,870
He allows you to some extent.

560
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,370
But there's one fellow in America

561
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,410
wanted to talk to Me on the telephone and discuss about Sahaja Yoga,

562
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,120
but he found Me a bit too much for him, perhaps,

563
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,160
and he started talking to Sahaja Yogis and he wouldn't,

564
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,000
he didn't talk to Me.

565
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,040
And everybody was very angry. I said, "Forget it".

566
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,950
The other day I received a message

567
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,990
that he was doing a program same type

568
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,250
and he collapsed, because he got paralysis.

569
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,410
So he is not a Sahaja Yogi. I am not responsible.

570
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,620
But if somebody calls Me a Mother then

571
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,830
the Paramchaitanya respects that way.

572
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,410
And you have no business to hit anybody

573
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,540
or to talk to anyone rudely, in any manner,

574
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,250
those who are Sahaja Yogis.

575
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,620
Of course if you want to tell somebody off

576
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,620
there are ways how this should be done, like a Sahaja Yoga way

577
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,250
and not like the violent things.

578
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,950
It's very, very wrong and I'm very upset to hear that people

579
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,450
suddenly become violent, even now in Sahaja Yoga.

580
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,990
This comes from liver, I know.

581
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,580
You can go in for your liver treatment, improve yourself,

582
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,200
but don't think that you can get away with it. You cannot.

583
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,660
Is better such people fast for two days

584
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,120
and punish themselves.

585
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,370
Temper is the worst thing

586
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,790
and Shri Krishna has told that temper is the worst

587
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,000
from where everything starts.

588
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,580
So we must control our temper and understand

589
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,620
that Christ was the embodiment of forgiveness, embodiment.

590
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,990
We are worshiping Him today.

591
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,160
How He forgave people?

592
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,450
Those who crucified were not the Jews actually.

593
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,450
They were the Romans. The Roman authorities crucified Him.

594
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,160
But Paul decided that we should try to condemn the Jews,

595
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,700
"So the Jews have done it". Jews have not done it.

596
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,580
And they condemned Jews forever.

597
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,660
With this kind of an attitude people hated Jews,

598
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,830
and they troubled them and they were tortured.

599
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,910
Then Jews also had a reaction. They are equally the same.

600
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,000
So is not the Jews, because is never done

601
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,700
that you ask a multitude, a magistrate asks the multitude,

602
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,200
whether you should crucify a thief or this man.

603
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,040
It's never done. They have to take their own decisions.

604
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,290
This is never done.

605
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,250
So this is just to bring a curse on the Jews.

606
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,120
This Paul has done the greatest harm.

607
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,700
But now, thank God, may we have many Jews and we have

608
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,370
also a center in Israel, is working out all over.

609
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,910
We have lots of people from Iran who have come to America,

610
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,830
who are also Jews and who are also Muslims,

611
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,750
they all have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

612
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,910
So it is something that's happening

613
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:47,040
and also the Sufi people from Turkey I hear, are joining us

614
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,580
and also Sufi people from India, we'll be able to get them.

615
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:57,790
So thus it will work out and it will work out for everybody's good.

616
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,500
But first of all we should understand how Christ was

617
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,870
and how His life was and how He loved the world.

618
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,040
He came on this earth to be crucified.

619
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:16,040
He knew He was to be crucified and He did it.

620
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,540
The way they have given His picture is not correct.

621
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,990
He was a very healthy, hefty, tall person.

622
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,040
He had to carry that cross. Those people who paint Him,

623
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,580
like a Tb patient, should know that they

624
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,830
if they have to carry the cross, can they do it?

625
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,200
So all sorts of things they have done

626
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,080
to harm His personality, to assassinate His character.

627
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,990
But you being Sahaja Yogis should know about Him,

628
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,620
and must have full respect, full faith in Him.

629
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,750
And He is your eldest brother.

630
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,120
As Shri Ganesha is, He incarnates as your elder brother.

631
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:03,500
He's there to look after you in every trouble, in every kind

632
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,080
of a turmoil.

633
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:11,620
He is going to help us in every way, all the time,

634
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:17,160
and only way is to surrender, to forgive.

635
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:22,330
That is the quality of Christ we have to imbibe.

636
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,540
May God bless you all!
