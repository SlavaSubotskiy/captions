1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,280
First, I will speak in Hindi language and then in English.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,160
We are such a cosmopolitan people

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,920
that I don’t know what language to take to.

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,440
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi till 21:39 ]

5
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,680
I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship -

6
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
what should happen to you.

7
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
But today, I am going to tell you about

8
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
the internal happening within us

9
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,440
when you get your Realization.

10
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,760
There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven of them.

11
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
They are particles, we can say, anshas they call it,

12
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,439
of Shiva’s powers.

13
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,600
And all of them try to take out

14
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,600
or to remove all the false ideas we have about life.

15
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,760
When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of them.

16
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
And, say for example,

17
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,040
Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

18
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,240
Now, all of them, what they do is to control us

19
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,160
from falling into the prey of various things.

20
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,080
Like, we have an ego.

21
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,760
So, Buddha will look after the ego part.

22
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,360
He will see that you get shocked by your ego.

23
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,000
You will be quite amazed

24
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,320
how you could be so egoistical,

25
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,520
and so insulting, and so humiliating.

26
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,560
But when this rudra is not awakened,

27
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,439
when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens?

28
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,680
You start justifying yourself.

29
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
You think whatever you do is correct,

30
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,800
whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said,

31
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,320
whatever you have achieved,

32
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,520
you think is your right.

33
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,800
You’ve done nothing wrong.

34
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,040
For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

35
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,640
On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego,

36
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,360
if you go on becoming egoistical,

37
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,880
you become absolutely a right-sided personality.

38
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,840
Once you are a right-sided personality,

39
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,720
you know what all the symptoms there are of such a person.

40
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,520
Now, for that if you just watch

41
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,880
and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you,

42
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,880
what wrong ideas you had about yourself.

43
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,160
So that’s why Mohammed Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

44
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,360
He didn’t know what else to tell.

45
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Because this ego business can really burst you,

46
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,200
your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

47
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,120
Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

48
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,360
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless,

49
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,040
cannot move.

50
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,680
Consciously people cannot move.

51
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Unconsciously they will, but not consciously.

52
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,600
And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile.

53
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,960
You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.

54
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,400
They can’t sit on their own.

55
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,280
In a very young age this can happen. This is happening in America.

56
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Also, I have seen two, three cases here,

57
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,760
in India, also such a thing happened.

58
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,680
So if you do not try to see your ego and control it,

59
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,920
and feel repentant about it.

60
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance,

61
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,600
we don’t believe in repentance.

62
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,320
Because we believe that you all have got your Realization,

63
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,440
you are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true.

64
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,680
We have to repent.

65
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,920
There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry.

66
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,640
Sorry, for everything they will say sorry.

67
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,880
Even telephone if you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

68
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,240
I say, “Sorry, for what?”

69
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,240
But this sorry itself is very empty.

70
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,760
It has no meaning. It has no depth.

71
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,160
When you say “sorry,” you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

72
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,000
and what is to be corrected.

73
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,439
This is a very big problem of today’s generation

74
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,960
where people have developed such tremendous ego-

75
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,520
because all our economic growth,

76
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,000
all our industrial developments,

77
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,000
all our big, big organizations,

78
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,840
all of them have given us a way

79
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,320
that we should all develop our ego.

80
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,920
If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

81
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,440
And that’s how we start pampering it,

82
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,640
and then this right-sided problem starts.

83
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
Then as a reaction, it goes to the left side.

84
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,560
Actually, in the head it is on the right side.

85
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,120
Here is the right side ego comes up,

86
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,080
so the left rudra is that of Mahavira.

87
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,000
So people do things, which are sinful,

88
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,720
which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

89
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

90
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,960
He says, “You will go to hell; this will happen,”

91
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,920
he describes all the hell, all kinds of hell,

92
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,240
that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

93
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

94
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,280
But that doesn’t help.

95
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,480
So people start getting more onto the left side

96
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,840
and, I should say,

97
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,640
through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless,

98
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,720
then a tremendous depression comes in.

99
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,600
One feels very depressed. “Oh God.

100
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,840
What a depression I have.  I am so sick.  I am this thing.”

101
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,280
And then you try to frighten others with your depressions.

102
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,080
You show sort of a, what you call, an emotional blackmail you do.

103
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,439
All kinds of things you will do,

104
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,960
and beat your head and do all kinds of things.

105
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Could be through ego, could be through

106
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,360
this left side problem of the left rudra.

107
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,880
These two rudras are very important

108
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,080
because they are directly connected with our

109
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,040
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

110
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
So, it’s very important to see

111
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,520
that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras.

112
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,720
These rudras are to be satisfied.

113
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,840
So to be normal, at least look after these two rudras, which are:

114
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,840
one is the one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

115
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,720
“I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

116
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,840
All this works out

117
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,840
into, physically also, into very serious problems like cancer.

118
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,600
If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer.

119
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,400
But all this portion gets swollen up.  It’s called as the medha.

120
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,960
This all portion gets swollen up,

121
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,840
and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over.

122
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,040
At least would be here, or maybe there.

123
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,640
Because such a swing in the nature of a person

124
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
that you can’t say

125
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,680
from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

126
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,920
Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come

127
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,960
because the rudras have become ineffective.

128
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,400
It can be due to the depressive nature

129
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,600
or oppressive nature.

130
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,120
It could be due to many other factors also.

131
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,040
But all these factors are nothing

132
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:17,640
but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s,

133
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,840
or Sadashiva’s powers.

134
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,320
He is the one who is full of karuna - full of compassion.

135
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,720
He is the ocean of compassion.

136
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,200
If you ask Him forgiveness, He'll forgive.

137
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,160
Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

138
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,280
then He forgives.

139
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,520
But if you think you, whatever you have done is good,

140
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,920
you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,

141
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,920
then it knows.

142
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,160
Shiva knows everything, isn’t it?

143
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:00,080
And, because it knows, it starts giving up.

144
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,240
So there’s a big combination of your willpower

145
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,080
to be there, and the combination of the blessings of Shiva.

146
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,720
When the Shiva blesses you,

147
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,080
your willpower also heightens.

148
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,400
But you must have full willpower

149
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,320
to know that you have

150
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,240
to be of a higher level of personality.

151
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,960
He was not at all a mundane type.

152
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,480
I mean He was…

153
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,320
supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that,

154
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,360
how will He look there?

155
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,360
People will laugh at Him.

156
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,800
When I met some hippies, I said,

157
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,280
“Why are you having this kind of hair?”

158
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,080
So they said, “We want to -” they are all primitive -

159
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,200
so he said, “I want to be primitive.”

160
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
I said, “But the brain is modern.

161
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,920
What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

162
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,240
So, deception. Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

163
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Best thing is to face yourself and understand

164
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,760
what wrong you have been doing.

165
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,560
If it works out, I tell you,

166
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,560
so many Sahaja Yogis you are sitting here.

167
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,200
If you correct yourself and become that

168
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:22,040
I am sure all the problems - political, economic,

169
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
and all stupid problems we have - will be finished.

170
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,439
But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

171
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,600
that even the worst people are carrying on.

172
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,040
Now, we have a responsibility to save this world.

173
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,200
We have a responsibility to create a great, honorable life,

174
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:50,560
which is not superficial, which is not just to show off.

175
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,360
But inside it should develop

176
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,560
so that this light of your spirit spreads

177
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,240
and enlightens this world.

178
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,680
It’s very important to understand

179
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
all these troubles and these,

180
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,560
I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases,

181
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,080
and all other problems which are,in a collective way we can call,

182
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:20,200
of the Kali Yuga like political, economic, all these problems -

183
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,160
only are created by human beings.

184
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,400
They're not created by the Divine Force.

185
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,840
But Divine Force tries to neutralize them

186
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,439
if there are many Sahaja Yogis

187
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,840
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

188
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,360
If that could be done, if that could be achieved,

189
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,120
then I think we can do a lot,

190
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,439
a lot for the betterment of humanity,

191
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
and that’s why we have got realization.

192
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,080
It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family,

193
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
it’s not only for your city or country,

194
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,000
but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

195
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Now, if you have to do competition,

196
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,360
you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else.

197
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,920
But people are so superficial

198
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,800
that they think by showing off

199
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,439
or by becoming something – a big Johnny -

200
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,840
they will achieve something of a very great level, is not so.

201
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,320
It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also,

202
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,320
so that you understand that whatever you are doing

203
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,200
is for the betterment

204
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:50,200
of global problems.

205
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,160
Absolutely we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine.

206
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,360
If I could do it alone, I would have done it.

207
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,880
But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all

208
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,120
and to tell you that you become all the channels.

209
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,720
But in the meanwhile, you enjoy.

210
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,360
You enjoy life. Every second becomes a joy,

211
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,600
which is also the gift of Shiva.

212
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Shiva is the one who creates this

213
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,960
great admiration

214
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,400
and great appreciation of every moment,

215
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,680
everything that is there.

216
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
And that is the state we have to achieve,

217
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,360
by not condemning yourself,

218
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,560
or not by pampering your ego,

219
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,560
but by seeing what you are.

220
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,920
That’s the main thing one has to see, is what problem you have,

221
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,240
and what is troubling you is yourself only.

222
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,160
If you could just come to that point of understanding,

223
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,800
I am sure, I am very, very sure

224
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,520
that you will be such an asset

225
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,800
to help to make this world look at itself and change.

226
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,280
Because superficially you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

227
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,720
And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini

228
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,800
that you can really become a great

229
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,960
torch, I should say,

230
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

231
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,520
May God bless you.

232
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
Today first we'll have a short puja of

233
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,720
Shri Ganesh

234
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,120
and then of Shiva

235
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,640
And lastly of the Goddess.

236
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,760
We have little bit changed the sequence.
