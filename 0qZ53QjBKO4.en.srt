Clap like this and will get it.

17
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:16,832
See Kawaal Clap like this.

Hriday Anand Bhar Bolo, Badhaayee Hai Badhaayee Hai (4)

36
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,082
Very Good!

37
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:05,207
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Maata Ki Jai!

38
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:05,623
Shri Mataji: Great!

39
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:11,124
Singer: Jai Kara is too short. Let it be Punjabi Jai Kara.

40
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:15,373
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

41
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,249
Laughter

42
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:22,790
Singer: One Jai Kara we will make

43
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:36,540
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

44
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:40,748
SY: Who will take out such a long breathe?

45
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,124
Singer: Take out your breathe to say Jai for Maa

46
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:46,373
The breath that Mother has given, keep it on.

47
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:49,082
Maa gives you breathe, Maa will give you breathe.

48
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,249
You try it and see how far your breath will go

49
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:51,373
Shri Mataji: Good!

50
00:10:51,415 --> 00:11:06,347
Singer: Say, Adi Shakti Nirmala Mata Ji ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

51
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,372
Shri Mataji: it went on for a pretty long time.

52
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:12,165
Everybody laughs.

53
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:13,503
Shri Mataji: You see one thing is there

54
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,832
that Your Sahastrara opens when you clap.

55
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:18,372
Check it with your hands, because the whole Sahastrara opens

56
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,373
Vibrations improve absolutely.

57
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,373
This is the benefit of clapping

58
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,373
See, immediately the Sahastrara opens.

59
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:26,373
Sahastrara is in our hands and feet.

60
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,582
But here (Shri Mataji shows on HER palms) when you clap

61
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,498
You are hitting your chakras

62
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,373
Actually, when we clap like this ( Shri Mataji shows on HER palms)

63
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:34,373
Chakras are surely hit by chakras

64
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,582
Immediately, this Sahastrara opens.

65
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,124
Specially for void

66
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,677
A person who has problem of void,

67
00:11:39,702 --> 00:11:41,785
or have been harmed by some Gurus

68
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:47,082
 should clap their hands rigorously in kawaali

69
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:52,540
and those who used to be kawaals, used to sing in praise of Gods

70
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:56,415
For example bhajans, but now they have changed the format of Kawaalis

71
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,415
Earlier ladies would not sing at all

72
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,373
and even if they would sing, they would sing collectively

73
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:05,623
But now the format of Kawaali is absolutely vulgar

74
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:12,707
This is not the real format of kawaali.

75
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:17,249
Amir Khusro Sahib introduced Kawaali.

76
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:21,665
Amir Khusro Sahab. He was the disciple of Aulia Nizzamudin.

77
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:26,965
And he in his daily language and daily life

78
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,370
introduced poetry in such a way

79
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,082
For example, Babul Mera Naihar Chuto Jaye,

80
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,040
It has all been written by him.

81
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:35,832
In daily songs, marriages and all other functions

82
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:40,207
he has written about Gods in such a way that it cannot be understood

83
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:41,707
but a person sings in appreciation of Gods.

84
00:12:42,082 --> 00:12:46,373
Very Beautiful! He introduced it.

85
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:48,373
He introduced that by hitting all it will be okay

86
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:51,999
He introduced Kawaali.

87
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,197
And it used to be first at their Dargah (Shrine ).

88
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:55,373
and then at Chishti's

89
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:59,040
And today a great Kawaal had come there

90
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:04,249
Most probably named Nusrat Hussain Sahab from Pakistan

91
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:08,373
As soon as he saw ME, he said, "Mother How are you here?"

92
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,790
In the midst of all he said,"Mother, please sit in the front."

93
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:16,124
He took ME and made ME to sit in the front seat and started singing.

94
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,124
And said, "Today i am singing in my true form

95
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:17,515
as you are sitting in front of me."

96
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,373
You see he doesn't even know anything about ME

97
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,165
But he is his disciple.

98
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,207
At Aulia Nizzamudin Sahab's Dargah also

99
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,790
the earning hands reached there too.

100
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,498
In the beginning I said nothing.

101
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:36,790
I told somebody that this Nizzam Sahab was a self realised soul.

102
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,082
Some people went there

103
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,373
And since that day they started offering money.

104
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:43,249
His relatives started collecting money there.

105
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,124
Oh! you are sitting at their door, collect something else as well.

106
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:47,623
He is collecting  the same thing.

107
00:13:49,582 --> 00:13:51,040
Here Nizzamuddin Sahiba

108
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:53,332
And Chishtis also, they were all Awllias.

109
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,498
And Awlia is the same, who is called Peer

110
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,124
or what we call realized souls.

111
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,291
It is one and the same thing.

112
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:01,623
There is no difference in that.

113
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:02,498
It is one and the same thing.

114
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,165
It is only we who quarrel unnecessarily.

115
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,000
Let them do

116
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,748
As many heads they break, is good because it is a nuisance.

117
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,540
Those who are fools, let them break their heads

118
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:11,999
Later they will all come to their senses.

119
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,650
S.Y: Same thing is going on in Punjab.

120
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:15,307
Shri Mataji: They are all fools.

121
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:20,994
Now just tell, Nanak Sahab, He only was Muhammad Sahab

122
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,671
All of them said one thing only

123
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,121
Mohammad Sahab thought that now they have started fighting

124
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:28,317
as He had come as Nanak Sahab

125
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,877
Worked so hard, did everything

126
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,139
and now see what a show is going on.

127
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,145
They will come to senses.

128
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:41,152
It is necessary for them to learn a lesson, I think.

129
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:44,689
Unless fanaticism doesn't get exposed openly

130
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,099
till then it will not be visible.

131
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,868
Hindus must observe it, Muslims must observe it

132
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,142
Sikhs must observe, what a foolishness it is.

133
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,514
They will understand only when they will observe it.

134
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,486
Otherwise, the Rakhshasas will not be visible

135
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,714
and will thrive deep inside

136
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,311
So, what is called starking in the front

137
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:00,959
It is existing in the forefront

138
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,022
How much foolishness is it!

139
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,874
Where have we landed in the name of religion?

140
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,180
Is it a religion?

141
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:08,252
Is it God?

142
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,465
One who is the Giver

143
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,841
One who is God Rahim, is Ram, how can He be like that?

144
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:19,709
There is no comparison between Nanak Sahab and these people.

145
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:23,162
Among Hindus also there is too much of cruelty

146
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:23,961
That is why recently

147
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:27,018
I used MY TEEKA ASTRA (weapon to criticize openly) for the Brahmins.

148
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,635
(UNClEAR)

149
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,496
felt that I was sitting in the slums of Brahmins.

150
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,533
(UNCLEAR)

151
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,451
You have created such a mockery of God's images

152
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,516
 have ways and means of earning money.

153
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,889
But now it has its somewhat effect on the people.

154
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:41,793
It is showing its effect.

155
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,288
It will have to be said!

156
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:46,042
Otherwise how will Dharma be established?

157
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,430
We have established Vishwa Dharma

158
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,343
all the dharmas will merge into that.

159
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:51,274
Because all this is Adharam in the name of Dharma.

160
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,123
 It is bad name of God.

161
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,942
 Whosoever sees it feels what a foolishness it is!

162
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,702
That is why many people have no faith in God.

163
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:02,096
The same thing happened in Algeria

164
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,113
There the people saw that they are fundamentalists

165
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:07,374
They are forcing they are very cruel, they are killing everyone

166
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:10,276
Iraq is killing Iran and vice versa.

167
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,719
They thought that communism is better.

168
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:16,021
Five hundred people took to communism.

169
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,721
Out of them got influenced by us in London.

170
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,920
He said, God exists, Communism is telling lies.

171
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:25,425
We have not to be scared of any fundamentalism.

172
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,475
We are standing on our own ideals.

173
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,443
Five hundred people got their realization

174
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:31,745
came by aeroplane and got their realization.

175
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:34,656
It will be like that only

176
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:37,716
Many Sikhs are also there. Many Sikhs had come to Birmingham

177
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:39,662
They still come here.

178
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:41,512
Everybody will come to senses.

179
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,872
They see what is it!

180
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,054
Where are they unnecessarily jumping into the sea?

181
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,735
When the talk is going on about God

182
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,746
one should rise towards sky.

183
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:50,653
All are jumping into the sea

184
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,514
fighting amongst themselves

185
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,062
Is it a joke?

186
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,885
I mean to say the way they are getting agitated like this

187
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,103
and especially those who are

188
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:02,080
 Sikhs, like Maharashtrians

189
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:02,696
they are in Maharashtra.

190
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,409
They got scared

191
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,057
that they will kill us too.

192
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:09,185
They are already killing them, they will kill us too.

193
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,588
But now they will be alright.

194
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,641
Let them be sensible.

195
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,236
They have become too much fanatics.

196
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:15,679
There is a need to be sensible.

197
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,518
Everybody needs to be sensible.

198
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,813
They will be better now.

199
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,429
For some time let them get punished.

200
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:31,993
No body dies.

201
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,563
Nobody is going to die.

202
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:34,962
You give up this worry.

203
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,361
This should happen to show it to the world

204
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:39,236
so that it becomes clear.

205
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,107
Just now I read in the newspaper

206
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,730
a Sikh has been arrested.

207
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:46,677
He says that all these Sikhs do smuggling.

208
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:50,117
Binderwallas smuggle drugs.

209
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:53,132
and i do this work to catch hold of them.

210
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,681
You see, they have been arrested.

211
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,204
Those who talk about God

212
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,628
talk about temples

213
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:01,899
talk about mosques

214
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:03,970
what concern they have with smuggling.

215
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:05,857
It is just a contrast

216
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:07,416
One is darkness

217
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,434
the other is light.

218
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,400
Both these can never be together.

219
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,978
Can't understand how do people accept it.

220
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:21,461
This is the situation.

221
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,063
But it is so!

222
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,255
Not only this,

223
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,501
all those who are great Popes

224
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,150
Popes and

225
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,214
others like maphia

226
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:35,368
Maphia and Pope are just one with each other, do you know?

227
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,059
and they have got one bank

228
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:40,501
and all these owners of Switzerland banks are great thieves.

229
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,953
Have collected the unauthorized money all over the world

230
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:44,100
and you will be surprised

231
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,964
the place where our programme was organized

232
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:47,537
in Calvinist church

233
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:49,112
just in front of that was the bank

234
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:50,641
and they were arrested there only.

235
00:18:51,822 --> 00:18:53,541
There only all the three were arrested.

236
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,181
All of them very fraudulent

237
00:18:55,643 --> 00:18:58,225
Maphia, pope and swiss bank

238
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:00,227
all the three in competition.

239
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:07,666
most fraudulent had collected and created a problem

240
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:09,527
are getting exposed, they are getting exposed.

241
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,472
This is the best way now a days

242
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,767
that let all be exposed

243
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:14,189
and come to an end with that.

244
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,023
In these swiss banks

245
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:22,172
the money is of the fraudulent of all over the world

246
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:25,151
roam all over the world with a red cross.

247
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,884
It has the money of people all over the world.

248
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:33,442
How should such people be recognized?

249
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:42,622
The question is that these people have settled themselves all over.

250
00:19:42,729 --> 00:19:43,436
And who are these people?

251
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:46,073
They are from masonic lodge.

252
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:47,558
They are mesons.

253
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:50,693
Those who were secretive earlier, they are those thieves.

254
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:54,330
They thought if you have to steal, better steal something worthwhile.

255
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:59,773
By secretly participating in masonic lodge

256
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:00,814
they became secretives

257
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,635
and by mutual help ruined Swiss bank.

258
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,367
This is the situation.

259
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,133
In such a world

260
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:13,938
if they have to establish Sahajyoga then

261
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,421
with a great effort, set its foundation deep

262
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:20,294
first settle down their mutual differences and come up.

263
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,263
The greatest thing is to put an end to their mutual differences

264
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,712
have to spread Sahajyoga

265
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:26,638
all have to do it collectively.

266
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:29,488
It is not possible without that.

267
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,446
It cannot be done without joint efforts.

268
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,813
We can win only by collective efforts and by nothing else.

269
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:36,163
Only with the collective efforts we can win over such things.

270
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,491
They are all alone everywhere.

271
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,930
But how can we win is by collectivity.

272
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,990
And in Delhi there is a great need of the growth of collectivity.

273
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:48,252
Here everyone is Prime Minister of India.

274
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:51,921
That is a great problem.

275
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:56,195
But it is good that now a days bhoots are after the Prime Minister.

276
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,006
They will be after you too.

277
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,329
Shri Mataji laughs

278
00:20:59,354 --> 00:21:02,096
If you think that you are Prime Minister

279
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:04,666
you will have to walk with four Aides.

280
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,518
Singer: We will proceed with Mother
 Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so!

281
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,355
Shri Mataji: yes, now you sing one more song.

282
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:16,949
Singer: A sahajyogi proceeds forward with Mother's energy

283
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:19,188
Doesn't have to be a Prime Minister.

284
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,917
That is what I am telling.

285
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:25,561
By being in such a falsehood, it is not possible to move smoothly.

286
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:31,218
By living in simplicity kundalini has no problem.

287
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,129
There should be no crookery in any case

288
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,896
But you see what type of crooks are in the world?

289
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,444
They are dependent on God.

290
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:41,715
If anyone follows Sahajyoga, then he settles down.

291
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,413
I am not the responsible for that. You are responsible for that.

292
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,217
If you yourself want to go to filth, what can I do?

293
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,985
How long can we stop them?

294
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,147
You take your decision, where to go?

295
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,645
You take decision on the New Year's Day

296
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,952
that we have to follow Sahajyoga only.

297
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:02,969
We have to follow Sahaj yoga.

298
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:04,142
What is the meaning of ''Sahaj mein uttarna hai''?

299
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,156
After acquiring your own power

300
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:10,286
knowing your own glorious tales you have to move forward.

301
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:11,994
What is so great about it?

302
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,235
Tell ME what is the other way apart from Sahaj?

303
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,486
The rest are all misleading routes.

304
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:19,510
I can't see any other route.

305
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,340
The path which is going to give you everything is SAHAJ MARG

306
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:26,700
Then follow that. Leave everything else.

307
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:33,134
That is why I said there is no need to fast.

308
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:35,375
Fasted on Karwa Choth

309
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:36,739
They were ladies of U.P

310
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:40,584
Are the rest of the ladies bad those who do not keep this fast?

311
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,642
For the time being told her not to keep fast.

312
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,666
They vomitted so much

313
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:48,375
that next day they stood in front of ME, holding their ears

314
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:49,570
I asked them,"What happened?"

315
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:51,233
They said," Mother by mistake we observed the

316
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,757
fast of KARWACHOTH yesterday and fell sick."

317
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,821
I said,"You see I didn't make you fall sick.

318
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,701
I had beforehand told you not to keep the fast on KARWACHOTH."

319
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,914
They said earlier they would not have it like this.

320
00:22:57,939 --> 00:22:59,655
I said, "Earlier you had caught hold of snake in ignorance.

321
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,610
 Now don't hold it when you have knowledge."

322
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:07,679
If you want to fast, do it there is no problem.

323
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:10,481
But don't do it in the name of God.

324
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:12,176
You don't gain any thing by defaming HIM.

325
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,759
HE is giving you everything

326
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,937
Even then you want to fast, do so.

327
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,766
So, whatever Mother says

328
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,799
even though you may feel it strange

329
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:26,905
but try to understand that this is the truth.

330
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:30,152
This has been going on for the past so many years.

331
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,801
It has no meaning.

332
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,888
If there has been any foolishness going on for the past so many years

333
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,814
are you still going to do this foolishness?

334
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:37,276
 Has it helped you in any way?

335
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:39,258
Another thing is

336
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,764
as I was telling Dr. Sahab

337
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,817
Everybody says, It has never been so earlier.

338
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,675
If it has not been so, but it will be so someday.

339
00:23:44,944 --> 00:23:47,835
It will take place some day.

340
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,455
Whenever it will take place

341
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,093
it will be said that it didn't happen earlier.

342
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:52,517
Should it take place just after its birth?

343
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,688
Should it take place just after the world creation?

344
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,080
Such type of arguments go on like this.

345
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:01,299
Because of that If a person wants to run away from Sahaj yoga

346
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,335
the door is open for him but he who wants to sit

347
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,509
there is a a seat reserved for him.

348
00:24:05,535 --> 00:24:07,857
All of you settle down.

349
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:09,971
I want all of you to settle down perfectly in Sahajyoga.

350
00:24:10,052 --> 00:24:12,911
This is the first thing. Everything happens later on.

351
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:16,232
and settle down people.

352
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,742
As you said: Maa you came in the form of flame.

353
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,161
What will flame do single handed?

354
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,717
Many flames are required.

355
00:24:22,742 --> 00:24:24,990
We need many flames from one flame.

356
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,264
Only then there will be light.

357
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,226
Had it been possible by ME alone

358
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:33,302
Why would I have requested you people to settle down?

359
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:38,037
One who prays to God for the betterment, move ahead smoothly

360
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,295
You only are on the stage, not I

361
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,729
You are on the stage. The world is watching you.

362
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,880
Understand that the world is watching you, not to ME.

363
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:51,012
They have taken that out, saying that this is Devi.

364
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:53,400
I cannot be Devi.

365
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,162
The point is that they have made a Devi

366
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:58,475
Rest you handle.

367
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:07,272
Delhiites are otherwise also sitting on the stage on their own.

368
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:09,445
on the throne

369
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,343
Bakasurs are sitting on the stage.

370
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:13,790
They are sitting in the gallery.

371
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:17,811
You are sitting on the threshold of God

372
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:20,396
You sit there. People will watch you only.

373
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:24,932
People sitting on the threshold

374
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:28,047
will watch what are people living in Delhi doing?.

375
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:33,057
It is a great responsibility.

376
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,380
There is a great responsibility on people living in Delhi.

377
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:37,709
What do you have to say?

378
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:43,747
Lekhak ji (writer) Yes, say!

379
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:47,853
Yes, write down

380
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:49,473
(UNCLEAR)

381
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,229
It is the best

382
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,146
 Deepa didn't come today?

383
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:56,841
She is in Dharmshala

384
00:25:56,929 --> 00:25:58,509
Shri Mataji: She is in Dharamshala.

385
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,192
S.Y: She is much better.

386
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:09,365
Yes, you come!

387
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:13,181
Open it.

388
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:23,154
Fix it at bottom.

389
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:37,901
music

390
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:39,471
Shri Mataji to the singer: Your face has changed.

391
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:44,221
Singer: Everything has wholly changed.

392
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:49,361
Shri Mataji to a Sahajyogi: Just see! his face, saintly!

393
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:55,504
Musician: Yesterday there was a great miracle.

394
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:59,045
People have defamed me. Tomorrow i will tell on the stage.

395
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:13,347
Rashtrapati has given me in written, result and certificate (UNCLEAR)

396
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:17,649
I got President's award, people talked all nonsense.

397
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:25,650
They are talking like that. They cannot defame MOTHER'S son.

422
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:26,343
Shri Mataji: Beautiful! You people have started singing in Sanskrit

423
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,609
It is great!

424
00:31:27,937 --> 00:31:41,021
Don't become Pandits now. It is really great!

425
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:47,192
Actually, voice is vibrating.

426
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:54,077
Because of the vibrations, it is cooling.

427
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:58,561
When you sing you feel vibrates, your voice reverberates.

428
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,296
The same is the case with him too.

429
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:02,452
When he had sung earlier it was not so

430
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:10,341
but since he is in (Sahaj) his voice vibrates.

431
00:32:10,714 --> 00:32:13,466
It is like a echo

432
00:32:14,514 --> 00:32:20,620
It is called PRATISATH in Sanskrit.

433
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:26,251
Beautiful! He is doing so great!

434
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:31,705
Such pronunciation of Sanskrit

435
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,864
I have not heard such pure pronunciation among Punjabis.

436
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:37,999
I am telling you the truth.

437
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,704
I too have studied in Punjab.

438
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:43,875
The language of that place is such

439
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:47,776
And even Hindi speaking people pronounce SPASHT as ASPASHAT

440
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,272
But I have never heard such pure pronunciation in Sanskrit language.

441
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:54,194
I am telling you the truth. It is great!

442
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:57,640
It is great! It should be so.

443
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:10,021
S.Y: Basically, Mother it is the effort of Rajesh.

444
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:13,988
He has started after coming here only.

445
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:16,334
(UNCLEAR)

446
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,893
Shri Mataji: Look at Rajesh as well!

447
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:23,164
Now a days he is studying Gyaneshwari.

448
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,597
S.Y: He is the one who started (UNCLEAR) Last time when he came,

449
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:31,863
Rustam and he came that was the day this whole started.

450
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:32,518
Shri Mataji: Oh! Really!

451
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,380
S.Y: About a week ago.

452
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:38,631
Then started Sanskrit. Rustam didn't know DEVNAGRI LIPI(script)

453
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:39,540
Can you imagine?

454
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:42,078
He didn't know Devnagri.

455
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,194
He never studied Devnagri. He studied in English school

456
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:46,303
then stayed in England.

457
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:47,869
He didn't know Devnagri.

458
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:48,779
He studied Sanskrit

459
00:33:48,804 --> 00:33:51,068
and is writing MY names in Sanskrit.

460
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,535
He has already written one thousand names.

461
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:55,961
S.Y: Has Rustam written?

462
00:33:55,986 --> 00:34:00,371
 Shri Mataji: Yes, He has written one thousand names.

463
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,767
S.Y: He is a Sanskrit scholar.

464
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,089
Shri Mataji: He has become a Sanskrit scholar

465
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,137
S.Y: And very inspired.

466
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,613
Shri Mataji: Yes, even Gregoire!

467
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,051
Gregoire has become a Sanskrit scholar.

468
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,672
Absolutely Sanskrit scholar.

469
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:22,624
How does the result of Sahajyoga come out?

470
00:34:22,776 --> 00:34:24,312
Because one who doesn't know even Devnagri

471
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:26,479
Gregoire never not even Hindi words

472
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:28,899
It is worth noticing, how beautifully he writes!

473
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,523
One who didn't know even A,AA,I,EE (Devnagri Script)

474
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,438
How did it happen?

475
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:38,496
Our Babba doesn't know Urdu at all.

476
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:39,474
I still know a little bit of it.

477
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:40,725
not even a little bit of Urdu.

478
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:44,357
But the poetry he has done in Urdu

479
00:34:44,388 --> 00:34:44,964
You listen to him.

480
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,727
MY brother, he is a Chartered accountant.

481
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:50,295
He didn't know even the name of poetry, what is poetry

482
00:34:50,485 --> 00:34:53,754
He was just like a stone hearted in this field.

483
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:56,643
He writes (Poetry) so beautifully, so marvelous.

484
00:34:57,902 --> 00:34:59,695
(UNCLEAR)

485
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:01,407
He has started writing very deep (poetry)

486
00:35:01,828 --> 00:35:04,167
He has named himself 'Dilosh'

487
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:05,945
means NIRMAL

488
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:11,099
named himself, very good (poetry) he writes.

489
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:15,090
MY brother himself wonders, where do YOU get these words from?

490
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:15,956
says: i don't know.

491
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:16,643
says I give him.

492
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:18,567
I said some words I too don't know.

493
00:35:18,592 --> 00:35:24,675
How does one know? It is so great!

494
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,520
He has started writing very nicely.

495
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,659
It is so surprising how. How does one bloom?

496
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,638
(UNCLEAR) poetry I never expected from him.

497
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:35,479
He is a Chartered accountant.

498
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:39,665
Except Math and counting he has heard no other sound.

499
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,483
I don't know from where he got this thing.

500
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,726
And says, i go on writing.

501
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:45,556
Now he is writing in Marathi.

502
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:49,336
His Marathi language was so weak, that I used to write his essays.

503
00:35:49,387 --> 00:35:52,552
He is writing in Marathi.

504
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:55,719
He is writing in Hindi, but out of all, the best he writes in Urdu.

505
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:58,479
[ SHERO SHAYIRI ] poet's expression in poetic manner

506
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,696
and there are no rhyming words at all.

507
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:05,780
It should be said that there is actual poetry in him.

508
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:07,318
Actual poetry!

509
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,841
There is nothing useless

510
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:10,946
Nothing useless!

511
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:13,542
Do you see this MILAN KI SHAYIRI (poetry of union) we have got?

512
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:16,499
The earlier poetry was all about gloominess

513
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:17,925
VIRAH KI SHAYIRI [poetry of separation]

514
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,349
Now it is poetry of union.

515
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,615
You set it in his song

516
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,011
There are so many

517
00:36:26,442 --> 00:36:29,956
but they were not so popular.

518
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,606
S.Y: It is coming right from the heart.

519
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,108
He is writing right from the heart.

520
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:40,500
Shri Mataji saying about HER brother:

521
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:43,498
It is remarkable for him to write poetry.

522
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:46,640
I know he is conditioning poetry very well.

523
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,961
Because of Marathi he had little difficulty

524
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:52,218
I used to sit with him to teach him poetry.

525
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,819
I would tell him that by telling you, I will lose my poetry.

526
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:57,562
It doesn't enter even your head.

527
00:36:57,618 --> 00:37:00,476
He would ask: Why do they write?

528
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,251
Why don't they write in a straight forward manner?

529
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:05,279
writing about moon and this and that in a twisted manner

530
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,316
it is better to say

531
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,648
it seems (UNCLEAR)

532
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:10,851
When he was young

533
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:12,400
when he was in Matric

534
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:14,919
(UNCLEAR)

535
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:17,195
Would say why did they need to write all this?

536
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,824
It has caused my headache.

537
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,210
If one has to learn this Marathi language

538
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:21,959
it is a great headache.

539
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:22,803
I would tell him don't learn Marathi

540
00:37:22,828 --> 00:37:24,371
He would say it is compulsory, what to do?

541
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:27,088
Such was his condition.

542
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:30,461
In Marathi he would just pass or fail.

543
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:32,850
He is good at Mathematics.

544
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,764
But I could not understand

545
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:37,232
from where this new flower has bloomed.

546
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:41,408
It happened like this that somewhere

547
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:46,024
you can say for example that a lotus has bloomed out of a rose

548
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:51,442
(UNCLEAR)

549
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:56,908
It is like that, can't understand anything

550
00:37:56,933 --> 00:38:00,065
But it means, what an unusual, strange and

551
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,244
an unprecedented event is going on.

552
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:04,605
but like this something must come out of everybody.

553
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,166
some miracles should take place, then it will be recognized.

554
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,284
He (singer) is also saying that he will tell some miracle

555
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:11,945
A great miracle he has come across.

556
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,412
S.Y: Yes, really!

557
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:16,048
Shri Mataji: What you are saying

558
00:38:16,073 --> 00:38:18,644
the reason for that is only that you are NISHKALANK (pure)

559
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,841
Nobody can disgrace you!

560
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:24,396
If somebody tries, he cannot disgrace you.

561
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:29,586
Nobody can disgrace you, even a little bit

562
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,420
Even if you think that this person is disgracing you

563
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,723
You will see that this disgrace will be on his face.

564
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:41,851
In Illustrated Weekly Rajneesh sent a woman

565
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:44,181
bribed her, to interview ME.

566
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:46,765
and made a third Muslim lady to write

567
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,712
and in that some wrong statements were

568
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:51,327
that SHE is such

569
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:55,667
HER ways are such that SHE mesmerizes. All nonsense.

570
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,249
My husband got very angry.

571
00:38:57,274 --> 00:38:59,590
Especially, my brother took a dagger.

572
00:38:59,616 --> 00:39:02,234
Both of them said, "Now we have to drag them to the court."

573
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:04,073
I told them, I am not going to the court.

574
00:39:04,098 --> 00:39:06,109
If you want to put up a case, you go, I am not going to the court.

575
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,185
(UNCLEAR)

576
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,623
I asked them what will you do?

577
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,929
There in London people told them

578
00:39:10,954 --> 00:39:13,354
that they should put up a case for ten lakhs.

579
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:14,863
I said, " I won't go to the court."

580
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,641
You do whatever you want to do.

581
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:17,895
It is not going to pay you any dividend.

582
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,038
I made them to understand a lot.

583
00:39:19,063 --> 00:39:21,760
I told Rajesh to talk to them.

584
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:23,803
Tell them to ask for forgiveness

585
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,502
so that this matter will be over.

586
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:27,654
I don't like this court business.

587
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,086
When nobody came to any agreement

588
00:39:30,111 --> 00:39:33,202
The Illustrated Weekly came to closure for six months.

589
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,520
And they had a loss in terms of Crores.

590
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:45,494
Then their employees went on a strike.

591
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,345
Then they sent a message.

592
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,500
They are saying why you had written against our Mataji

593
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,769
we will go on strike.

594
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:55,516
I said that they have written long back.

595
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,459
Why are you going on a strike now?

596
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,028
Already they have been punished

597
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:02,561
But they won't change.

598
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,339
You have to set right first of all, newspaper agencies.

599
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,384
Now you tell ME what is the need to write what Rajneesh is saying?

600
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:14,058
Now a days it is Ravan UVACHA (what did Ravana say?)

601
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,326
S.Y: That is a fact.

602
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:20,199
Shri Mataji: This is the Geeta of modern times.

603
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:22,347
What useless he is talking?

604
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:23,871
They get a lot of pleasure by publishing it.

605
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:25,164
Don't know why?

606
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,444
And now a days he is in Goa.

607
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,429
Now a days we can see some more people.

608
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:31,020
As bed bugs multiply

609
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:34,697
so can be seen two to four such people in Poona.

610
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:36,170
They will all be taken into account.

611
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:39,051
They will surely reach Poona.

612
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:41,389
Poona!

613
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:44,675
They are coming out at wrong place.

614
00:40:46,302 --> 00:40:47,240
All this

615
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:48,772
Their techniques are like

616
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:51,480
it appears to be like a group

617
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,596
They help each other.

618
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,544
We too should have our strong group.

619
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:57,645
Question doesn't arise that anybody can touch you!

620
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,972
We should live like this.

621
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,571
We are all one.

622
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:01,563
We should have one aim.

623
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:03,347
We should know this aim.

624
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:06,823
Then you will enjoy your dividends yourself.

625
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,437
But when we don't know that aim, we face problems.

626
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:15,249
We have come to Delhi.

627
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:17,046
We have to do something or the other here.

628
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:18,461
It is New Year!

629
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:21,115
You do whatever you desire.

630
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,941
In the evening we have pujan

631
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:24,957
We will see then.

632
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:29,158
But all these desires should be for the betterment of everyone.

633
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,926
Not for yourself, I take care of you.

634
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,788
There is no worry about you. It should for everyone.

635
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,372
It should be for the group.

636
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:38,762
It should be for others.

637
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,898
Not for yourself.

638
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:41,692
You for yourself have (surrendered to ME)

639
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:44,808
You said that you have surrendered yourself to ME

640
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:48,084
I am already managing you.

641
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,720
You have to take care of the whole world.

642
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:57,517
Specially, We have to take care of Delhi.

643
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,279
Is it okay!
