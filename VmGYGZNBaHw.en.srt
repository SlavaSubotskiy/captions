1
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:01,857
Please be seated.

2
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:37,865
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

3
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:44,469
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

4
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:10,326
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

5
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:23,327
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

6
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:34,231
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

7
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:38,207
of the Mother and Christ.

8
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:58,852
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

9
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:05,418
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

10
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,010
And when they could not explain it,

11
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:23,970
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

12
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:37,134
Even before Christ, they used to have

13
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:41,718
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

14
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:48,909
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

15
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:10,670
to worship what they call Yahovah.

16
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:22,658
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

17
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:35,482
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

18
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:42,235
She incarnated before also.

19
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:48,853
She incarnated as Sita,

20
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:56,352
and then She incarnated as Radha,

21
00:14:56,671 --> 00:15:01,979
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

22
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,267
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

23
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:12,593
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

24
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:26,536
He was the son of Radha.

25
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,820
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

26
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:44,596
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

27
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:52,079
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

28
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:01,335
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

29
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:14,983
All the description about Jesus Christ

30
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:22,699
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

31
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:39,213
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

32
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:41,826
with immaculate conception,

33
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:48,120
which She had done before also, as Radha.

34
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:14,681
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

35
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:27,738
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

36
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:40,905
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

37
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:47,018
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

38
00:17:55,463 --> 00:18:00,142
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

39
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:15,971
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

40
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:31,476
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

41
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:36,501
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

42
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:42,919
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

43
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:05,269
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

44
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:21,174
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

45
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:34,648
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

46
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:44,078
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

47
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:50,378
because He is just vibrations.

48
00:19:53,193 --> 00:20:01,017
So when you do puja to Me,

49
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:07,542
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

50
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:22,134
If they had done puja to Christ -

51
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:30,048
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

52
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:44,460
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

53
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:53,884
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

54
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:09,605
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

55
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:24,835
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

56
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:38,254
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

57
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:47,968
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

58
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:53,420
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

59
00:21:57,697 --> 00:22:01,199
which is the swayambhu,

60
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:05,855
is created by the Mother Earth.

61
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:13,315
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

62
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:26,211
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

63
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:43,076
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

64
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:53,699
So I went to see that place

65
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:01,476
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

66
00:23:01,677 --> 00:23:06,173
about say, five inches, at the most.

67
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:17,136
And the face was just like Mine,

68
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:22,244
exactly like Mine.

69
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:29,474
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

70
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:38,263
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

71
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,804
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

72
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:58,784
and they started following under a rock,

73
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:10,295
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

74
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:16,324
And in that light they walked,

75
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:19,710
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

76
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:25,884
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

77
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:44,793
So they worship that statue in that place.

78
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:54,438
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

79
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,397
as I give you vibrations,

80
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,990
but not so much

81
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:09,558
as I give you.

82
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:13,776
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

83
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:17,916
who might be giving you vibrations.

84
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:25,550
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

85
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:29,307
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

86
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:33,955
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

87
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,464
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

88
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:52,342
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

89
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:07,453
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

90
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,520
and there are many sweet water wells there.

91
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:24,255
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

92
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:28,030
many people took photograph.

93
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:38,096
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

94
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:45,457
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

95
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:55,450
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

96
00:26:55,672 --> 00:27:01,254
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

97
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:19,703
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

98
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:24,868
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

99
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,755
Same is the puja.

100
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:45,453
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

101
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:56,863
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

102
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:10,249
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

103
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:20,841
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

104
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:29,950
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

105
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:45,786
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

106
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:53,445
what powers He gives you.

107
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,261
When you praise those qualities,

108
00:28:56,462 --> 00:29:03,338
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

109
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:17,805
This is how the Divine works,

110
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:24,670
as if you get charged with those qualities.

111
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:34,981
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

112
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:46,485
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

113
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,279
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

114
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,578
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

115
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:08,292
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

116
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:11,851
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

117
00:30:12,052 --> 00:30:16,422
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

118
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:37,445
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

119
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,736
It could not happen earlier,

120
00:30:53,644 --> 00:31:01,478
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

121
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:13,435
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

122
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:16,597
that I look like you, I behave like you,

123
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,684
I have made Myself exactly like you -

124
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:23,001
very difficult to make, but I have.

125
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:48,361
And this body has to bear lots of things

126
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:58,299
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

127
00:32:09,076 --> 00:32:12,425
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

128
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:16,404
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

129
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:20,641
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

130
00:32:20,842 --> 00:32:26,169
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

131
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,809
and moving very fast.

132
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:46,658
Now I have to bear it.

133
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:51,968
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

134
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:04,593
Because He is very direct,

135
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:13,490
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

136
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:25,843
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

137
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:34,098
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

138
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:52,613
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

139
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:57,320
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

140
00:33:57,536 --> 00:34:01,971
so I take time to take them out.

141
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,067
So all these things are very symbolic,

142
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:25,280
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

143
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:36,291
And that symbol actually acts.

144
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,567
For example if you give somebody a flower,

145
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:47,574
 that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

146
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:52,228
and gratitude comes in.

147
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:06,047
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

148
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:14,540
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

149
00:35:26,945 --> 00:35:31,425
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

150
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:34,638
and of their blessings on you.

151
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:39,645
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

152
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:52,476
That is how the Divine acts.

153
00:35:55,703 --> 00:36:04,536
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

154
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,884
Now we are doing puja at this time,

155
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:16,164
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

156
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:23,708
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

157
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,210
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

158
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:45,105
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

159
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:50,378
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

160
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,588
Now they are getting the same blessings,

161
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:55,535
though you are doing the puja

162
00:36:55,736 --> 00:37:00,515
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

163
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:26,376
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

164
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,960
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

165
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:34,484
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

166
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:39,629
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

167
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:01,921
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

168
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:07,714
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

169
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:19,916
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

170
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:25,630
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

171
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:44,578
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

172
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:54,867
So you should be very relaxed about it.

173
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,921
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

174
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:05,997
May God bless you all.

175
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,330
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

176
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:17,456
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

177
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:20,901
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

178
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:23,034
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

179
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,623
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

180
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:31,906
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

181
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,942
The children have to wash the Feet

182
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:41,660
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.

183
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,123
Yogi: Yes. In Spanish, Mother?
Shri Mataji: In Spanish.

184
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:47,461
Yogi Yes.
Yogi 2: OK. Pujari?

185
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:50,430
Shri Mataji: Now see the description
of Shri Ganesha

186
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,305
which was written thousands of years back.

187
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:58,563
It’s translated and exactly the same
of that of Christ.

188
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:05,852
We have little added to it about Christ
in the end, but it’s the same.

189
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:22,031
First the boys must wash and the girls
must paint.

190
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:25,190
Yogi: OK.

191
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:30,683
Shri Mataji: So she – they are unmarried
girls.

192
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:37,531
Unmarried women and unmarried girls
should do it, paint.

193
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:41,366
First let them wash. First let the boys
wash –

194
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,434
just tell, first let the boys wash,

195
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:50,249
and then the unmarried women, unmarried
girls should paint,

196
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,311
and then the married women should give
the ornaments.

197
00:40:53,512 --> 00:40:55,422
Now, can you bring it from the… Warren:
She is going to help with the washing,

198
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,770
for children to wash.
Shri Mataji: All right.

199
00:40:57,971 --> 00:41:01,912
So now, can you get the ornaments also?

200
00:41:21,338 --> 00:41:25,708
So first of all you get the water together,

201
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:29,914
now this one [container of water from Feet]
is to be brought here.

202
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:37,986
Yes. Can I have this kumkum?

203
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:42,124
Swastika should be made on that. Swastika
should be made.

204
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:46,258
Then other things also, My necklaces-
and all that.

205
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:51,559
No, no, the bangles are – and necklaces
I gave you

206
00:41:58,036 --> 00:42:00,605
Yes.

207
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:13,909
Just correct, correct, correct. It’s
the other way round it is. Yes.

208
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,475
No, it’s not that.

209
00:42:20,678 --> 00:42:24,914
Once this is made, just take it to go
through.

210
00:42:29,056 --> 00:42:33,296
Yogini: Excuse me.
Shri Mataji: You take a cloth.

211
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,509
And bangles are there?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

212
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,817
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, it goes like that.

213
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,681
Just if you can wipe it, it’s all right.

214
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:57,289
You can just yes, wipe it, I’ll tell you.

215
00:43:11,894 --> 00:43:14,466
All right.

216
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:36,498
This was the correct swastika. And
the other way is the Hitler’s swastika.

217
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:40,157
Can I have the towel? I’ll have the towel.

218
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,137
[Warren: “Yes”.
Yogi: “It’s the same, Mother”

219
00:43:43,338 --> 00:43:49,140
Warren (aside): “Did she respect the form?”.
Yogi: “It is the same”.]

220
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,876
You may keep it in a plate.

221
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:55,775
Warren: Yes, I’m just going to get it,
Mother, I’ll get another plate.

222
00:43:55,976 --> 00:43:58,655
Shri Mataji: And the bangles?
Warren: Yes.

223
00:43:58,856 --> 00:44:03,279
Shri Mataji: Just give Me that, Albert.

224
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,315
What is it, are you giving these bangles?
Warren: Done the same that the…

225
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:14,362
Shri Mataji: What’s it?
Warren: Yes, done the same

226
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:17,527
that the swastika is the same, is the one
that was used by Hitler,

227
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,150
he just turned it on the side.
Shri Mataji: No, no.

228
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,487
You see, what happened in the beginning
he was using the other way round.

229
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:27,841
Then what happened, they used – that’s
your Mother’s trick –

230
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,772
they used the stencil in the other way
round,

231
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:36,833
so the thing, swastika, turned round and
they lost. You don’t know this?

232
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:41,718
To begin with, they started an upside-down
thing, you see, the other one,

233
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:45,279
to begin with. They started using the other
way.

234
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,506
But then the stencil was used in the other
way round. You see?

235
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:54,702
You know, the whole thing turned and
they kept to this.

236
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:59,797
That’s how they lost. You don’t know this?

237
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:05,537
Yogi: No. Shri Mataji: Just tell her, this
is the trick I’ve played.

238
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:08,349
[Yogi: “They’d made the stencil the wrong
way”]

239
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,632
You see, the other way, they used
the stencil.

240
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,011
[Yogi: “Yes. And so it came out this way”]

241
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:16,021
You see, first they started using
the stencil on one side,

242
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:21,113
and then they started using it the other
side, and that’s how they lost.

243
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:24,322
Yogi: And it came out this way.
Shri Mataji: No,no, if you make a stencil

244
00:45:24,523 --> 00:45:29,811
like this, you see, first the other way
round it was, you see,

245
00:45:30,012 --> 00:45:33,435
and then if you turn it the other way
round, then you come this way,

246
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:35,645
it came this way. Yogi: Yes. It was on
the flags at the start this way, Mother.

247
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:38,034
Shri Mataji: No, this is the second
swastika.

248
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:43,365
The first swastika was the other way round.

249
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:47,219
That’s how they got it.

250
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,437
They used the stencils, you see, to make
the swastika first.

251
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,409
So first one was the other way round.

252
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,944
But then the stencils were spoiled or maybe
whatever it is, so they turned it round.

253
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:04,465
When they turned it round this swastika
started coming, they didn’t know.

254
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:13,778
One stands for destruction, another stands
for construction.

255
00:46:14,549 --> 00:46:18,660
Explain to them, so they’ll understand.
All right.

256
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:40,708
You follow the point?
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”]

257
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:44,393
That’s how they lost.

258
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:12,371
They took their advice to begin with from
the lamas,

259
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:16,455
and lamas told them to use the swastika
the other way round.

260
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:21,596
But then the mistake was that they drew
for them,

261
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,599
and then they turned the stencil, they
didn’t realize

262
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,861
that they have turned the stencil, so it is
coming the other way round.

263
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:35,587
They were their gurus.

264
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:48,452
So it’s all right, doesn’t matter, as long
as we know how to do it, that’s all.

265
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,904
Nothing to worry.

266
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:59,643
Yogi: It’s time to wash Your feet now,
Mother?

267
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:04,117
Shri Mataji: Now you have to wash My feet,
the children have to.

268
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:08,931
(Aside to a Sahaja Yogini: “Be careful”).

269
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:32,806
Just to pour water, that’s all.

270
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:37,915
Next time also remember

271
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:43,363
we’ll have to give them the pots for this,
for washing My Feet, all right?

272
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:50,082
For them. Warren? They haven’t got them.
Yogi: Yes, Mother, I’ve noted that.

273
00:48:51,837 --> 00:48:55,946
Shri Mataji: Rub it with both the hands.

274
00:48:57,193 --> 00:49:01,026
All right, this and this. Yes.

275
00:49:04,197 --> 00:49:08,825
Two persons can do at a time, two of you
would be [better].

276
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,001
Will be better. Two, two, ha. Now you
two do it.

277
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:17,090
With both the hands. With both the hands.

278
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:21,043
Tell them to do it with both the hands.

279
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:27,335
Use this hand also.

280

the qualities of Shri Ganesha]

Agni is fire.

302
00:55:25,066 --> 00:55:28,634
Javier: … Vayu… Shri Mataji: Vayu is air.
All the five elements,

303
00:55:28,835 --> 00:55:32,138
this means all the five elements.

304
00:55:33,527 --> 00:55:38,611
Vayu means air, but with the Agni, Vayu…

305
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:45,361
Javier: Indra, Vayu… Tu eres el sol,
the sun and the moon.

306
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:36,339
Shri Mataji: One minute. You come along –
those who are not yet married ladies.

307
00:56:39,173 --> 00:56:42,601
And the boys can go back.

308
00:56:56,672 --> 00:57:01,206
Come. All unmarried?

309
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,313
Put a little water. All right.

310
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:20,579
More water,

311
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:50,561
little more water. Little.

312
01:00:51,224 --> 01:00:54,066
You take out the…

313
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:39,684
Be careful.

314
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,815
May God bless you.

315
01:03:12,462 --> 01:03:16,304
Now. If we start the… [Yogi: “108 names
of the Devi?”] –

316
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:22,738
Eh? We can just start the Devi stotra

317
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,777
is all right, because they have started
with the Devi.

318
01:03:25,978 --> 01:03:28,804
Yogi: The 108 names or…

319
01:03:40,765 --> 01:03:44,213
Shri Mataji: This side also. Here.

320
01:03:55,657 --> 01:04:01,398
Only now - married women have to come
after this.

321
01:04:10,673 --> 01:04:19,276
Just you say one name, you say: “Shri
Mata”, then you say the translation.

322
01:04:32,629 --> 01:04:33,997
Now you must verify,

323
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:37,844
you see, these are the qualities they are
describing of your Mother.

324
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:43,229
Now you try to, try to verify it also.

325
01:04:45,073 --> 01:04:50,196
And these names were written also thousands
of years back.

326
01:04:55,235 --> 01:05:01,436
These are thousand names, we have chosen
only 108.

327
01:11:34,417 --> 01:11:38,841
Again, again.

328
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:10,562
Yogi: Nishkàla. Javier: (translates into
Spanish) Indivisible, completa.

329
01:12:10,763 --> 01:12:14,582
Shri Mataji: Nìsh-kalà (She corrects
the accents). Yogi: Nìsh-kalà.

330
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:28,806
Shri Mataji: (To one of the ladies)
Complete.

331
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:39,375
Full. Complete toe.

332
01:13:36,595 --> 01:13:42,953
Now. The married ladies now.

333
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:49,788
Now the married ladies come in – then you
can start it.

334
01:14:30,886 --> 01:14:35,070
Bangles, did you take bangles?

335
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:06,429
There are no bangles as such. Sorry.
It’s all right.

336
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:32,051
Doesn’t matter. Good. All right. Give it
away.

337
01:16:16,077 --> 01:16:19,497
Yes, yes, now. Yes, yes. Yes. Good.

338
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:37,462
Yogi: Nirmama.
Javier: No es egoista.

339
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:44,800
Shri Mataji: Nirdwanda. Nirdwanda.
Yogi: Nirdwanda.

340
01:18:08,027 --> 01:18:10,608
Shri Mataji: Mirror you [can have]. Mirror.

341
01:18:10,809 --> 01:18:14,070
Mirror you can have.

342
01:18:27,293 --> 01:18:30,293
Family.
[Yogini: “Yes”]

343
01:19:17,618 --> 01:19:21,125
(To the young boy bringing the Mangala
Sutra) Hold it.

344
01:19:24,933 --> 01:19:28,746
He’s very nice. It’s correct, now, it’s
correct, that’s right.

345
01:19:28,947 --> 01:19:33,924
Should be in this way.

346
01:19:36,491 --> 01:19:39,245
Thank you.

347
01:20:18,935 --> 01:20:23,055
(Aside to the lady who is putting the
anklet) Other way round, other way.

348
01:21:51,812 --> 01:21:56,694
Warren? They are missing here all
the (toe rings)

349
01:21:58,555 --> 01:22:04,196
for other toes. All they were there
in France.

350
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:06,955
Warren: They were in France, Mother, but
they went back to London…

351
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:10,155
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. It’s all right,
let’s see.

352
01:22:10,356 --> 01:22:14,055
We’ll have to get separate ones for them.
For every…

353
01:22:14,256 --> 01:22:16,930
(Warren: “For some reason they held them
separately in the…”)

354
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,544
All right, then it’s all right.

355
01:22:23,846 --> 01:22:27,084
Yes. You’ll give it. That’s right.

356
01:23:06,373 --> 01:23:12,639
Yogi: The sari. Javier: Sari.
Yogini: Sari… Yogi: I gave it.

357
01:23:21,358 --> 01:23:25,106
Shri Mataji: Just keep it. Just keep it.

358
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:35,825
Towel.

359
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:52,539
Now. I’ll take water. Water to drink.
Water.

360
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:14,260
That’s all. That’s all.

361
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:04,807
Hold it. Hold it.

362
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:25,304
Honey. Now honey.

363
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,158
It’s all right.

364
01:28:46,815 --> 01:28:52,572
Sugar, sugar.

365
01:28:54,759 --> 01:28:58,133
Sugar.

366
01:29:18,641 --> 01:29:21,404
Water.

367
01:29:36,382 --> 01:29:40,074
Sugar, sugar.

368
01:29:40,275 --> 01:29:43,578
Sugar, sugar.

369
01:30:00,106 --> 01:30:03,202
Water, water.

370
01:30:17,489 --> 01:30:22,094
Saffron, saffron is there.

371
01:30:48,745 --> 01:30:52,016
Some water.

372
01:31:47,618 --> 01:31:51,205
Now. Clean one…

373
01:32:17,267 --> 01:32:21,092
Scent. Scent.

374
01:32:43,832 --> 01:32:47,215
Scent. On the swastikas.

375
01:33:45,684 --> 01:33:48,511
Yes, yes. Attar.

376
01:33:55,972 --> 01:33:57,466
They’ll have… good.

377
01:33:57,667 --> 01:34:05,016
(To a girl) Please put it to all of them
like this. Yes.

378
01:34:20,179 --> 01:34:21,610
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: On the wrist.

379
01:34:21,811 --> 01:34:23,444
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

380
01:34:23,645 --> 01:34:26,852
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: To all of them.

381
01:34:30,769 --> 01:34:32,787
I told her to put to all of them
the Chandan gandha.

382
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:35,687
Did she understand that?
[Yogi: “Yes”]

383
01:34:38,669 --> 01:34:43,679
Now. Ah, with flowers.

384
01:35:08,938 --> 01:35:13,083
Sari, sari. So…

385
01:35:23,032 --> 01:35:26,025
Warren? Warren?

386
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:28,952
There’s no blouse with it?

387
01:35:29,153 --> 01:35:33,033
Half, half, put it half way.

388
01:35:33,257 --> 01:35:36,704
[Yogi: “There is a blouse”]
There’s a blouse, where is it?

389
01:35:54,914 --> 01:35:59,600
Maricruz, Maricruz.

390
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:27,693
There, good… Leave it there. Yes, good,
leave it there. Tell her to leave it.

391
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:44,588
Now. Every lady has to take a fruit and
the rice - hello?

392
01:36:44,789 --> 01:36:49,504
Every lady has to take a fruit in the hand,
and -

393
01:36:49,809 --> 01:36:54,604
a fruit in the hand and some rice and put
it here.

394
01:36:54,805 --> 01:36:59,204
See, I’ll take it a little. Where is
the cloth?

395
01:36:59,907 --> 01:37:03,867
There’s a cloth there. That’s it.

396
01:37:11,021 --> 01:37:15,311
Now you tell them. To catch one fruit
in the hand.

397
01:37:15,512 --> 01:37:18,655
Yogi: Before the sari, Mother?
Shri Mataji: No, sari is all right.

398
01:37:18,856 --> 01:37:23,527
Keep it like that. Now fruit is there.
Now, take the fruit.

399
01:37:23,728 --> 01:37:28,339
You see, will be confusion, that’s why
to say one by one.

400
01:37:29,168 --> 01:37:32,422
 Keep it. Keep it.
[Yogi: “After the sari”]

401
01:37:33,244 --> 01:37:36,641
See, take the akshata (rice).

402
01:37:46,702 --> 01:37:52,263
Yes. Now you hold it. You hold the sari.
Hold it.

403
01:37:56,419 --> 01:37:59,930
Like that. Yes. Yes, take one side.

404
01:38:58,596 --> 01:39:02,605
Yes, she has all…

405
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:14,220
All right, now.

406
01:39:15,135 --> 01:39:22,527
If this you can remove, then we can go
ahead, well, with flowers.

407
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:26,861
Just remove these, one by one.

408
01:39:27,067 --> 01:39:31,898
It’s dangerous. Just remove those
(candles)…

409
01:39:59,951 --> 01:40:03,108
You better have the sari now.

410
01:40:03,309 --> 01:40:06,699
But they have got something for the hands?

411
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:12,077
Flowers for the hands, they have any?

412
01:40:12,278 --> 01:40:14,892
No? Just flowers, ask them,

413
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:19,808
otherwise they might be disappointed,
if they have made.

414
01:40:25,016 --> 01:40:27,302
Garland?
[Yogi: “There is a big garland”]

415
01:40:27,503 --> 01:40:30,925
All right. Now. You put this.

416
01:40:33,993 --> 01:40:37,368
The other way round. Yes.

417
01:41:06,026 --> 01:41:14,889
Put the flowers around… And some garland.

418
01:41:35,511 --> 01:41:41,294
Yes. Exactly, when you have finished.

419
01:41:43,671 --> 01:41:47,316
Yes. Now the garland has to be put.
Oh, you got that?

420
01:41:47,517 --> 01:41:51,937
Yes, that’s what I’ve asked. That’s
beautiful.

421
01:41:52,138 --> 01:41:58,849
So I’ll wear the garland first and then
the… All right.

422
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:04,071
(The crown) tie it up more.

423
01:43:08,918 --> 01:43:13,532
Tighter, still. Now, still tighter.

424
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:31,908
Should be tighter as it is. It’s all right?

425
01:43:32,109 --> 01:43:35,538
Now I’ll have.

426
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:57,600
Some photographs, if some people want
to take?

427
01:44:00,247 --> 01:44:04,726
Cloth there, in the corner.

428
01:44:29,126 --> 01:44:32,174
Make it neat, so the whole thing comes out,

429
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:35,123
and now you can put the lights and
everything,

430
01:44:35,324 --> 01:44:38,132
so you get a full picture of the puja –

431
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:42,930
remove that towel and make…

432
01:48:43,254 --> 01:48:45,507
Shri Mataji: Now, can you little bit do
it neat

433
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:48,898
and then we’ll have the Aarti.

434
01:48:54,948 --> 01:48:58,479
What is there?
[Prasad is offered to Shri Mataji]

435
01:50:12,076 --> 01:50:15,512
Sahaja Yogi 1: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi 2: Aarti.

436
01:58:19,197 --> 01:58:24,118
Yogi: Bolo Shri Bhagavati Mataji

437
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:30,680
Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

438
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:04,128
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
May God bless you all.

439
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:07,417
May God bless you all.

440
01:59:08,982 --> 01:59:11,700
May God bless you.

441
01:59:12,941 --> 01:59:17,628
It’s very good, everybody has very good
Kundalini.

442
01:59:17,851 --> 01:59:20,741
May God bless you.

443
01:59:26,828 --> 01:59:29,759
That’s good.

444
01:59:55,223 --> 01:59:58,326
May God bless you.

445
02:00:02,478 --> 02:00:08,363
Except for Vishuddhi, all other chakras are
all right –

446
02:00:10,552 --> 02:00:12,402
for which you have to say Allah Hu Akbar.

447
02:00:12,603 --> 02:00:17,165
Say it now, sixteen times.
Yogi: Sixteen times.

448
02:00:18,977 --> 02:00:22,988
Warren: We should stand. Shri Mataji:
Sixteen times, to open the Vishuddhi.

449
02:01:25,574 --> 02:01:28,948
All right.

450
02:01:42,813 --> 02:01:45,322
Good.

451
02:01:47,017 --> 02:01:51,244
Give yourselves a bandhan. One.

452
02:01:51,466 --> 02:01:54,048
Slowly.

453
02:01:55,746 --> 02:01:58,179
Two.

454
02:01:59,180 --> 02:02:02,870
Three.

455
02:02:03,214 --> 02:02:06,050
Four.

456
02:02:06,352 --> 02:02:09,523
Five.

457
02:02:09,737 --> 02:02:13,689
Six. And seven.

458
02:02:13,890 --> 02:02:17,103
Now raise your Kundalini.

459
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:24,586
Tie it up. One. Again.

460
02:02:26,417 --> 02:02:31,114
Tie it up. Again.

461
02:02:31,315 --> 02:02:36,586
Now tie it up three times. Fix it up on top
of your heads.

462
02:02:36,786 --> 02:02:43,627
One – two – three.

463
02:02:43,828 --> 02:02:48,401
Very clear, today it’s very clear.

464
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:51,312
Ah!

465
02:02:52,595 --> 02:02:55,453
Can you see?

466
02:02:57,464 --> 02:03:00,170
Feeling?

467
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:06,488
All right. May God bless you.

468
02:03:16,111 --> 02:03:20,074
Warren, I can wash My Feet in the room
or not?

469
02:03:24,509 --> 02:03:28,542
You have to take out these things here.
(Warren: “The ladies”.)

470
02:03:30,125 --> 02:03:34,031
Or we can go in the room and take it out.

471
02:03:34,232 --> 02:03:38,646
It’s all right. (Yogi: “All right”)
… Yes.

472
02:03:48,567 --> 02:03:51,318
Warren: It’s vibrations on the gold.

473
02:03:51,519 --> 02:03:54,503
Shri Mataji: Ah!

474
02:03:55,675 --> 02:03:59,831
This was - are they given by the English,
I think.

475
02:04:00,032 --> 02:04:03,253
All right, yes. [Warren: “Yes”]

476
02:04:14,898 --> 02:04:17,929
Take it closer first, then it will become
good.

477
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:21,962
Bring it closer (not clearly audible)…
Warren: Take it closer.

478
02:04:28,643 --> 02:04:32,028
Other Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have some
presents.

479
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:35,816
Shri Mataji: Presents? Oh, have you?
Sahaja Yogi: Can I bring?

480
02:04:36,017 --> 02:04:38,990
Shri Mataji: All right.

481
02:04:41,424 --> 02:04:45,496
But not too many, you have given Me
those presents today.

482
02:05:03,097 --> 02:05:07,471
Warren? This also goes... now, thank you.

483
02:05:09,054 --> 02:05:12,335
While this is, this one is Mine, and this
one is –

484
02:05:12,536 --> 02:05:17,124
or you can keep it in your bag (necklace).

485
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:25,671
[Yogi: “Can I help, Mother?”]

486
02:06:03,605 --> 02:06:06,456
This one also (bracelet).

487
02:06:22,777 --> 02:06:28,487
It’s all right. Please, be seated.

488
02:06:32,571 --> 02:06:34,620
Yogi: This is the collective present from
Spanish people, Shri Mataji.

489
02:06:34,821 --> 02:06:36,031
Shri Mataji: From where?
Sahaja Yogi: Collective present.

490
02:06:36,231 --> 02:06:38,488
Shri Mataji From Spanish?
[Yogi: “Yes”.]

491
02:06:38,689 --> 02:06:41,380
Thank you very much.

492
02:06:42,011 --> 02:06:43,933
[Yogi: “May I help You, Shri Mataji?”.]
Beautiful rose you have made.

493
02:06:44,134 --> 02:06:47,696
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes, decoration.

494
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,400
May I help You, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I am not very good

495
02:06:50,601 --> 02:06:56,882
at it, thank you. Only I can open
Kundalini.

496
02:07:32,588 --> 02:07:38,343
It’s beautiful, this is Toledo work, yes!

497
02:07:41,533 --> 02:07:47,902
Beautiful, beautiful.

498
02:07:48,103 --> 02:07:49,788
Chakras is,

499
02:07:49,989 --> 02:08:01,965
this is the what you call the birds flying,
like the Holy Ghost.

500
02:08:02,166 --> 02:08:06,270
Thank you very much, very beautiful,
very beautiful.

501
02:08:06,471 --> 02:08:10,912
You must write it down here from
Spanish people.

502
02:08:11,113 --> 02:08:13,158
And date, because you know, so many
presents,

503
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:17,680
and they’ll be all going in the personal
archives.

504
02:08:23,905 --> 02:08:29,534
Yes, so. So the progeny can see what
you people have given the Mother.

505
02:08:39,237 --> 02:08:42,230
Oh, thank you very much.

506
02:08:54,048 --> 02:08:57,412
So their engagement is now announced

507
02:08:57,613 --> 02:09:04,124
and they’ll be getting married in
Ganapatipule, both of them. Fernando …

508
02:09:33,051 --> 02:09:35,883
May God bless you.

509
02:09:50,924 --> 02:09:53,688
Take this.

510
02:10:00,547 --> 02:10:03,857
I’ve tried to (open the package).

511
02:10:27,525 --> 02:10:35,675
Oh beautiful, it’s very beautiful.

512
02:10:40,202 --> 02:10:46,468
Nice, isn’t it? Beautiful. Thank you
very much, thank you.

513
02:10:47,855 --> 02:10:51,715
I hope you have written your name there,
somewhere.

514
02:10:51,916 --> 02:10:55,042
Inside the box could be,

515
02:10:56,219 --> 02:11:01,415
inside the box, both of you.

516
02:11:01,676 --> 02:11:06,952
You should have given Me the present
after the marriage, not before.

517
02:11:11,769 --> 02:11:14,356
As it is.

518
02:11:20,766 --> 02:11:27,583
I would like to know the list of people who
want to get married and their photographs –

519
02:11:27,784 --> 02:11:32,160
would be a good idea if you can send it
to us earlier,

520
02:11:32,361 --> 02:11:35,501
before we go to India.

521
02:11:48,035 --> 02:11:50,787
I mean, we have a form,

522
02:11:50,988 --> 02:11:54,961
and you can get those forms from England,

523
02:11:55,162 --> 02:11:58,141
and they are to be filled in with
a photograph,

524
02:11:58,342 --> 02:12:03,358
so that we get some time to see for
ourselves, because from all over the world –

525
02:12:03,559 --> 02:12:08,985
see heights, and also qualifications, and
aptitudes and everything.

526
02:12:09,186 --> 02:12:13,115
So that we can match better.

527
02:12:13,345 --> 02:12:17,929
All right. Thank you. Thank you very much
for a very nice puja.

528
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:22,649
May God bless you all. Thank you for all
that you have done

529
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:27,704
for Sahaja Yoga, and all that you have
done to look after Me.

530
02:12:27,905 --> 02:12:30,758
A little translate.

531
02:12:41,066 --> 02:12:44,153
And to look after Me.

532
02:12:46,022 --> 02:12:48,697
May God bless you.

533
02:12:53,889 --> 02:12:56,788
Now look after the new people, with care.

534
02:12:56,989 --> 02:13:01,386
It’s very delicate, with care.

535
02:13:07,665 --> 02:13:13,193
It’s very delicate, with care.
Then your knowledge.

536
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:22,558
May God bless you.

537
02:13:28,651 --> 02:13:32,297
Very good puja today, very good puja
I must say, very good.

538
02:14:17,570 --> 02:14:21,009
Beautiful.

539
02:14:27,898 --> 02:14:32,694
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

540
02:14:34,928 --> 02:14:37,213
Very good puja I must say, very important.
