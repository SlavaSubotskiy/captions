00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:11,140
Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,029
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

3
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,890
Cabella, Italia

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,890
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat. First is important to understand

5
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:38,849
the incarnation of Shri Krishna. Krishna word
comes from the word Krishi. Krishi means agriculture.

6
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,250
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality. And
for that, first of all, He had to think, “Where

7
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:10,789
are we as far as spirituality is concerned,
how is the land?” So what had happened at

8
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,500
the time of Shri Rama that He created lots
of maryadas and by these maryadas people started

9
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:30,970
mentally thinking about it, “I am not supposed
to do that, I am not supposed to do this.”

10
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:37,970
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj. As a result

11
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,450
people became extremely serious. They wouldn’t
talk much and they wouldn’t laugh; they

12
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,750
wouldn’t enjoy anything.

13
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,750
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

14
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:06,259
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:20,010
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

16
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,790
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

17
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,870
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

18
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,290
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

19
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,260
but he’s absolutely detached. And this detached
person doesn’t take to any grievances, jealousies,

20
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:30,190
all these things. That He told. But how to
achieve it He never told. And the second thing

21
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:43,790
He described is that you must work. You have
to work. After all, you have got all the human

22
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,989
tendencies – is to work. But the fruit of
the work, you leave it at the Lotus Feet of

23
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:00,819
God or you may call the divine Power. This
is another trick of His, because He realized

24
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:10,189
how human beings were twisted and how they
had a ego. If you tell them something, how

25
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,189
they’ll misinterpret it. So He took the
other way round, that tell them something

26
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:22,189
absurd. Now whatever work you do, your ego
is intact and with that ego, you can never

27
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,320
give it up at the Lotus Feet of the Divine,
then impossible. So He made a impossible situation,

28
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,890
that after some time people will realize that
this cannot be done and they’ll give up

29
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:51,890
this idea of leaving everything at the Lotus
Feet of the Divine. This was the one how He

30
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,380
prepared the land.

31
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.
Flowers, fruit and water. Whatever you offer

32
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Me, I will take it. I’ll take it.” But
when you do that, when you do that you must

33
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:30,330
have ananya bhakti. Ananya means completely
single-minded bhakti, when there is not the

34
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,980
other. This is only possible after realization.
Only after realization you can put the fruits

35
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,620
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
And only after Self-realization you can have

36
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,910
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which
is singular. These absurd conditions He put

37
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,340
for human beings because they were so much
complicated.

38
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,760
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

39
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,210
“How?”

40
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,100
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time. We

41
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:32,100
are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

42
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,350
singing.”

43
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:42,350
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave. But it is the way He wanted to

44
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:53,380
neutralize the absurdities of human beings,
that they thought this was the bhakti. Which

45
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,990
is not. Ananya bhakti is only possible when
you are realized soul, when you are connected

46
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,350
with the Divine, when there’s not the other.

47
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,350
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

48
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,580
on their stupidity. Because He thought that
“If I tell them directly do like this, do

49
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,290
like that, then they’ll say, ‘Of course
we did it, and still we never achieved it.’”

50
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,290
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur. For one

51
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,960
month they walk in rags, singing the songs
and on the way they go on eating food at different

52
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:51,740
places. According to them this is ananya bhakti,
and they achieve nothing. They have become

53
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:59,310
very sick and very tired and have a very bad
old age. But who can tell them? They are all

54
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,310
lost in it. So this is a way one could tackle
human beings to show their stupidity. And

55
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,900
so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

56
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,330
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

57
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,330
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing. We can say He’s the One who was

58
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:40,930
like a very great agriculturist. So His name
was Krishi – Krishna. There are so many

59
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,470
things I have told you about Him: how His
name came as Krishna, then as how He was called

60
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,080
as Radha, who was Radha, who was Krishna and
all those things. But when He talked of these

61
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
things also He told that you should become
Sthitapragya. That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

62
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Gyana means knowledge. So, you should get
absolute knowledge. That He didn’t say how.

63
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,620
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

64
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,820
in Sahaja Yoga.

65
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people. He thought by doing

66
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,300
all these things in a stupid manner, they
might develop a discretion to know that this

67
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,570
is not the way you can achieve anything. You
have to get your Self-realization. Discretion

68
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:53,570
was very important. At this juncture, when
we are facing a sort of a challenge of this

69
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,990
new millennium – that the whole world is
going to be destroyed and all those things

70
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,990
people are talking – it is really very important
to know through discretion what is good and

71
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,860
what is bad. One may talk of something as
very good, something as very bad. But the

72
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:31,120
divine Discretion is very, very different.
Very different and which acts by Itself. Once

73
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:39,120
you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

74
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,880
want to do it.

75
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,880
I’ll give you My example. We went to buy
a house and the fellow was, you see, like

76
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:56,550
a beggar he came. He said, “We have nothing.
We have no food. They have taken away all

77
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:04,770
our things and we are just absolutely starving.”
When they said that, when he said that “We

78
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,320
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt
pity for him.

79
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,530
I said, “All right, increase the price.”
First we increased the price.

80
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,900
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

81
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,220
Still we increased the price. I told My husband,
“You increase the price.” Though reluctantly,

82
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,900
he increased the price. Third time again we
increased the price.

83
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,850
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

84
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,840
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.” I

85
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,840
just left them and sat in the car – at the
right moment. That was not such a good proposition

86
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,910
or anything. But I could see they, I’m buying
it out of My pity; you may call it compassion.

87
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,240
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

88
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,240
out of it.” So this divine Discretion is
a very, very important thing, which we should

89
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:19,420
see how it works and should be satisfied with
it. Not to feel bad, that you have missed

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,240
a chance or anything, but you must feel very
happy that this thing has happened and that

91
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,560
your divine discretion has taken on.

92
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,560
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

93
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,210
have done something wrong. But if it is divine,
ultimately it will turn out to be very good.

94
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:52,210
I gave you a very basic example. But that
is also very true when you practice Sahaja

95
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:03,250
Yoga. The discretion of divine Discretion
is extremely important to play a very great

96
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,900
part in our lives, because this divine Discretion
gives us the real joy of our being, of our

97
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,070
self, of Sahaja Yoga.

98
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,070
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy. But with all these maryadas

99
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,650
of Shri Rama, He didn’t know how to do it.
So to give people joy He said, “All right,

100
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:47,210
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,
all sorts of things,” and with that He really

101
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,839
originated many things which were sort of
not serious. May look frivolous, but in that

102
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:02,980
there was joy expressing. All that He did
to give them a full idea as for a Sahaja yogi

103
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:12,690
or for a, you can say, for a self realized
soul, what should be the attitude towards

104
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,690
everything. But it is not that you have to
do it, but it just works out, it is like that,

105
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:29,190
that in the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.
Enjoyment. And that is what His idea was,

106
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:40,390
to create a sense of joy among people. Many
people – there are lots of critics – have

107
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,600
criticized this part of His life. According
to them, religion means you should become

108
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:53,300
just old. At the age of twenty years you should
become an old man of eighty years – something

109
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:00,300
like that, funny ideas of religious achievement.
But He talked of joy and He never talked of

110
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,589
renunciation. He never talked that “You
give up your family, you give up your children,

111
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:17,589
you give up everything,” never, never. He
said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

112
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,510
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment. With

113
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:32,510
attachment you can never enjoy. If you are
attached to something, you cannot enjoy anything

114
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,740
in a full way. Like, supposing you are attached
to your child. Very simple thing, you are

115
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,860
attached to your child. You’re attached
to your child, then you will be bothered about

116
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,160
things which should not be there, which will
not give joy to the child either. You’ll

117
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,160
not allow your child, say, to go out or to
talk to people, whatever it is – all kinds

118
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,490
of restrictions you will put. But if you have
really the divine discretion, then you will

119
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,250
know with whom he should talk, where he should
go, what he should enjoy and you will see

120
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,170
that he enjoys life.

121
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:25,170
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

122
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:33,450
thing. If you are detached, then you can see
it, say, from above … above him, above the

123
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,660
thing. If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also. As I said, now, see the carpets

124
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:52,370
are there. They are very, very beautiful carpets.
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll

125
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,839
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried
because I am attached – that these carpets

126
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,309
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at

127
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:11,309
those carpets and what do I see? The joy.
The joy that is put in by the artist who has

128
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:19,610
made them. And that joy really tries to reflect
in Me also. That joy comes in Me. So to have

129
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:33,290
anything, attachment to anything, there will
be joy … I should say there’ll be happiness

130
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:41,590
but not joy. Because joy is single and happiness
is double – happiness and unhappiness.

131
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,130
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

132
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:58,130
is there.” But joy is all pervading. It
has no boundaries. And you just get dissolved,

133
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,420
you get dissolved in the ocean of joy. That
was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that cut

134
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:15,730
out these maryadas. Nowadays we see the maryadas
of so many things are really useless. For

135
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,040
example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion. See when they live in maryadas

136
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:32,040
then what happens? They sort of coggle it
or they have all kinds of germination inside

137
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:43,179
like the pond, which is absolutely bound,
it is not flowing like river. So like that,

138
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,160
you see, it becomes a kind of a closed mind
with these maryadas. And when you have this

139
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,740
maryadas, you start thinking, “Whether I
should do it or not; whether I’ll enjoy

140
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,080
it or not.” With these maryadas only, you
kill the joy.

141
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,179
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

142
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:24,050
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

143
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:30,460
things of their religion, they cannot come.
They think, “This is our religion,” while

144
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,610
they don’t understand. Falsehood becomes
the maryadas and they don’t understand that

145
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,590
what is the maryada actually made by the religion
also.

146
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,990
You see now in Islam what is happening is.
With these maryadas, they want to have another

147
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:55,990
country, this thing, that thing. In other
Christian religion also same thing happening.

148
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:03,300
Also in Hindu religion. All these maryadas
are really stagnating them completely, and

149
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,300
they are getting crushed into it. There’s
no discretion. Because they have said it,

150
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:18,780
they do it. They are so much blind-folded
about it, that they cannot see what is right

151
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,640
and what is wrong. But after Sahaj, you can
see, you can laugh at them and you can see.

152
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:33,850
Then we have social maryadas. Social maryadas
are there which are sometimes, when abandoned

153
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:43,150
can become very horrid also. Like in the West
now, the women think that the less dress they

154
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:52,130
wear, the more beautiful they are. This is
a new thing they have started. Now this absurd.

155
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:59,130
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

156
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,640
want to have any clothes because we were animals.
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s

157
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,120
why so many women do not want to wear full
dresses. It’s just animal behavior. So the

158
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:22,490
maryada of – good maryadas also people can
give up saying that “We don’t want any

159
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:29,490
maryadas. We are free; we can do whatever
we like.” But in that freedom what do you

160
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,920
achieve? Your animal instinct works in that
freedom and you think you are a very free

161
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,620
personality.

162
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,240
Then we have maryadas of our country. God
has not made different, different countries

163
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:50,010
at all. Nor it is true there are different
countries, but variety is there. Variety of

164
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:56,460
people, variety of places is there. These
varieties must be accepted as something very

165
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,460
artistic and one should not get ruined and
confused with those ideas that “We are Americans,

166
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,620
we are Indians, we are this and we are that.”
You’re not. Now you can know after Sahaja

167
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:18,179
Yoga, that you are all Sahaja yogis and you
don’t belong to any country as such. The

168
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,549
country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

169
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:28,549
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

170
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:37,070
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

171
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,070
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that. All over the world there’s

172
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:52,070
going on, “We want this land; we want that
land.” Land belongs to God, not to human

173
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,549
beings. And what is the use of fighting for
land? I don’t understand. But this confusion

174
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:04,200
is there and illusion is there. And people
work out on this confusion and illusion to

175
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,270
such an extent that they ruin their lives,
the lives of their children. So many people

176
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:16,270
are lost, so many people are in the lunatic
asylum, I should say, because they end up

177
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:25,350
in some sort of a refugee camp. They are having
a good house, nicely living there. Then you

178
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,360
become a refugee. Why? Because they believe
that they can have their own land, they can

179
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:39,020
have their own place and they should live
there.

180
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,570
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

181
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:52,570
lands and that’s how people fight for land.
There’s no need to fight for land or fight

182
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:59,809
for your country or fight for this or fight
for that. But the situation is such that unless

183
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:06,809
and until you fight, you cannot get to the
truth. And that’s why if you remember that

184
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:14,010
Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.
Fight. You have to fight, that’s your work.

185
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:21,080
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

186
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,100
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

187
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:32,100
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

188
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:40,309
what they deserved. They were deceived, and
this is what Shri Krishna said that “You

189
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,720
should not by any chance become a slave of
these people, but you fight it back.”

190
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:59,510
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion. Is again the divine discretion

191
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,340
where you have to fight because you don’t
want to be a slave. If you are a slave, you

192
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,340
are no good. So for that you can fight. But
when people start fighting for separation

193
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,780
of a territory, is not correct. On the contrary,
one should never think of separating from

194
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,860
the main lands. Because it creates lots of
problems. But now we believe in the global

195
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:35,299
religion. We believe in the global territory.
We don’t have to ask for anything. Anywhere

196
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,510
you go, you are the citizen of that place.
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the

197
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:48,070
whole Russians will be with you. You go to
America, they’ll be with you. That’s how

198
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,730
because all these are ideas of human beings,
and if the human beings get transformed there

199
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:01,470
will be no problem of any war or any territory
to be achieved.

200
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:08,470
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us. As you know

201
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:16,780
that this is a part and parcel of the Vishuddhi
Chakra, where Shri Krishna resides; but when

202
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He rises to your Sahasrara, when He rises
to that level, then He becomes Virata. So

203
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:40,070
Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head, here
above the Agnya, and this Virat is the form

204
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,330
of Shri Krishna who has risen above the Agnya.
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become

205
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,900
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can
say. Because, unless and until you are above

206
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:13,679
your ego, you are still involved with yourself
and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But when

207
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:23,580
you rise above that and you become the Virat,
the great, then you are in the land of Virata.

208
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:32,410
And Virata’s powers are tremendous. Has
been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

209
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:39,850
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally. It acts in such a manner

210
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:49,120
that you sit here and anywhere it can act.
You have seen that now. Many a times people

211
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:02,010
say, “Mother it’s a miracle. My mother
was sick and she was not here and I just prayed

212
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,270
and she got all right.” This is all the
power of Virat.

213
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:16,270
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

214
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:24,850
a manner that everything we are connected
with. We are not separate. And every drop

215
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:32,270
is connected with the ocean. We are connected
with the whole universe. And when you become

216
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,980
a citizens, I should say, of Virat, then all
the things with which you are connected also

217
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:51,100
get your vibrations, your ideas, your ambitions.
Everything passes through that and it works

218
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,590
– it works.

219
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:06,590
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives. It is the Virata Shakti

220
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:13,630
that works. Now for that we have to know how
to do worship of Virata. First of all you

221
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:28,410
have to rise above your ego – very important.
Otherwise how can you worship? There is your

222
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:39,610
ego standing in between and how can you rise
up to the point of Virat? You have to pass

223
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:48,160
through that. Once you are above your ego,
you enter into the kingdom of Virata. There

224
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:58,059
the King is the Virat and you are the subject
who are looked after completely by Virata

225
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,740
Shakti, by the power of Virata.

226
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:10,740
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

227
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,970
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

228
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,989
to you. Supposing a person is of that level.
Now there may be a war in some other country

229
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:31,989
– it can stop. Somebody who is being oppressed
can win over. Anywhere your compassion moves

230
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,370
it works out. Whenever your attention will
go, it will work out. And sometimes you are

231
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:50,370
surprised as to how it works, “Mother, how
these things work out? How coincidences … how

232
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:58,020
these coincidences have taken place?” Only
thing is you have crossed that state of your

233
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:05,520
ego and have gone into the state of Virat,
which is a very important thing to do – is

234
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:12,559
to enter into the area of Virata. Then you
don’t think, “This is your country. This

235
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,799
belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

236
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,799
This belonging business finishes off. Then
you belong to Virat. And He uses you for His

237
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:29,610
own purpose in the sense that when your whole
thinking is different – becomes global thinking,

238
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:37,830
then He acts. And then His powers are many-fold.
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch

239
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,200
to call people. I have given conches to all
the leaders. So we have to now announce and

240
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:56,809
call people. But at the level of Virat, you
don’t have to do all that. At the level

241
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,980
of Virat it just – people see, they’ll
know. Just they will watch you and they will

242
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:19,570
know. Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

243
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:27,490
shining all the time. So, they’ll be impressed.
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

244
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:34,720
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

245
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

246
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:50,080
are actually not true. And all these things
on which you want to exist are no more. People

247
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:59,179
like to show off their wealth, some people
like to be very sort of demonstrative of what

248
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:12,559
they think they are. But in the case of a
person who rises above his ego, and he’s

249
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:21,390
a part and parcel of that Virata shakti, enters
into the kingdom of Virata, he knows he is

250
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:29,309
very small. He is very small compared to that
and he just dissolves into that Shakti. And

251
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:38,070
this should happen to us that we should humble
down. We should humble down and know that

252
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:45,490
our powers, whatever we have, if they give
us ego, we should get rid of it. We should

253
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:53,950
not have that ego. We should get rid of it
and we should actually achieve that state

254
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,980
where you can be called as citizens of the
Virata’s Power.

255
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,309
May God bless you all.

256
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:00,429
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children. You

257
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,419
are children there. As children you enter.
As Christ has said, “When you enter into

258
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:02,669
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”
And that’s what you have to be today, all

259
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:03,590
of you to be innocent like children. You have
to be innocent like children.
