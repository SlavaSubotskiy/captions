1
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,760
Today we are here to

2
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,640
worship Christ as He was resurrected

3
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
from dead.

4
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,680
There are lots of theories

5
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,640
about His death,

6
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,590
but actually

7
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,880
He resurrected Himself

8
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,870
and then

9
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,760
He went down to India and settled there

10
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,750
with His Mother.

11
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,800
The after-period of His Resurrection is not
described

12
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,590
in any books as such, but

13
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,910
in the,

14
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,680
one of the Puranas,

15
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,750
written about Shalivahana,

16
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
one of the kings of dynasty I being to,

17
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,680
has met Christ in Kashmir,

18
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,760
and he asked Him, ''What's Your name?''

19
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,870
He said, ''My name is Issa.''

20
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,720
And he then he asked Him also

21
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,840
that: ''From which country You come,
which place?''

22
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,720
He said: ''I come from a country

23
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,830
which is foreign to you and to Me,

24
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
and now I'm here in My own country.''

25
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,790
That's how He appreciated, I think, the
Indian thing.

26
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,920
And then He used to cure people there,

27
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,720
and His tomb is there and His Mother's
tomb also is there.

28
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,790
So there are other stories also

29
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,910
created by people who did not know much
about Him.

30
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
But whatever it is, what you find,

31
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,750
that Christ was very much impressed,

32
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,760
and was very much there to teach about
morality

33
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,960
as in the Indian Scriptures, very strongly.

34
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,800
For Him morality was the most important
thing in life,

35
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,920
because as you know,

36
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,760
He was the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

37
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,790
So for Him Ganesha's principle was
extremely important.

38
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,800
And that He has expressed by saying that:

39
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,800
''In the Ten Commandments it is said

40
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,600
that 'Thou shalt not commit adultery',

41
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,910
but I verily say to you,

42
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,720
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.'''

43
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,800
To such an extent

44
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,950
that even the eyes should not be
adulterous.

45
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
itâ€™s a very good understanding

46
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
of a personality,

47
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,590
where we find in the modern times,

48
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,640
most of them have their attention

49
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,680
moving up and down, with adultery.

50
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,630
Also in one of the Upanishads I read

51
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,640
that even to look at a woman is adultery,

52
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,680
even to think of a woman is adultery,

53
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,790
and talk to women too much is also
adultery.

54
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,920
These modern times I have seen there are
women

55
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,590
who are used as public relations,

56
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,720
everywhere, in every country.

57
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,750
When they just go and chit-chat

58
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,710
and talk to people in position,

59
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,840
and talk in such a manner

60
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,840
that they feel very much pampered.

61
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,960
And one of the ways of getting favors,

62
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,600
wrong favors, from officers,

63
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,790
is through this kind of P.R. business,

64
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,910
it's very common.

65
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,680
And this is what is responsible also partly

66
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,600
for the corruption in many countries.

67
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,790
Morality goes hand in hand with all kinds of
violence.

68
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,840
Anybody who is a violent person,

69
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,840
a person who is in the mafia,

70
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,960
a person who is regarded as an outcast,

71
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,680
all of them are adulterous people of the
worst type.

72
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,910
So one has to understand how important it
is,

73
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,880
that morality should be our basic asset in
Sahaja Yoga.

74
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,710
Specially I would say we are so lucky
to-day,

75
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,680
that it should be celebrated in the land of
Shri Ganesha,

76
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,680
that we should be here to celebrate His
Resurrection,

77
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,960
which actually is due to His clean,

78
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,920
we can say absolutely Nishkalank life.

79
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,680
Life, which was so pure.

80
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,640
His purity was there because He was
nothing but Chaitanya,

81
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,710
He was nothing but vibrations.

82
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,550
He was so pure that He could even walk
on the water,

83
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,960
He was so pure that death could not kill
Him.

84
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,760
So we have to aim at our purification.

85
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
We talk of resurrection,

86
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,640
when we think of getting a second birth.

87
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,800
As I have told you before, that an egg
becomes a bird,

88
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,680
that's called a ''dwijaha'', it's twice-born.

89
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,830
In the same way we who are covered

90
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,560
with our ego and our conditionings,

91
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,710
opens out to become a bird,

92
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,920
and that's how we all have come to know
about the Brahma,

93
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,870
about this all-pervading power which is the
Brahma.

94
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
And that's how we are now really become

95
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,590
the Dwijahas, meaning the Brahmins.

96
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,760
Those who have not known the Brahma,

97
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,960
without that, what is the use of any
worship,

98
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,750
or any kind of chantings or anything,

99
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,630
because you are not connected,

100
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,950
and if you are not connected, it has no
meaning.

101
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,960
But we have to look at ourselves,

102
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,830
about purity part of it.

103
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,640
On a very low level of people, you see,

104
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,910
l have seen that the impurity comes

105
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,680
from what Christ has called as ''murmuring
souls''.

106
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,960
These are the people who start talking

107
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,870
at the back of others,

108
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
and just enjoy this kind of talk.

109
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,680
This is a very low type of a personality.

110
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,800
l think in Sahaja Yoga this should go away
completely,

111
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,880
because it creates problems,

112
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,640
and the main basic strength of Sahaja
Yoga

113
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
which is collectivity, is harmed by them.

114
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,910
Specially in this respect I would request
the women,

115
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,960
specially the wives of the leaders

116
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,960
have a great responsibility.

117
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,750
lf they start talking like that,

118
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,750
taking interest in such talks,

119
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,760
then they come down to the level of others,

120
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,710
and their motherhood is challenged.

121
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Any mother who allows the children to talk
like that

122
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,870
is really spoiling the entire life of that, of
children.

123
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,680
Anybody who talks ill of anybody in Sahaja
Yoga

124
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,760
is really extremely dangerous for both of
them,

125
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,880
but specially for the person who does it.

126
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,590
So one should always avoid even thinking
ill of others,

127
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,760
let alone the talking of it.

128
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,680
lf anybody talks like that,

129
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,550
you should put your hands to your ears

130
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,760
and say: ''Don't tell me,

131
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,600
l don't want to hear anything against
anyone.''

132
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,830
Because when we start talking against
someone,

133
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,760
we get all the bad things that person has.

134
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,840
Apart from that our mind is spoiled,

135
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,760
is impurity in your mind.

136
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,950
Then you talk to others,

137
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,750
it increases and it becomes worse.

138
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,560
It is the responsibility of the women,

139
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,830
to be very much careful, because

140
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
this kind of thing is more with the women

141
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,550
because they are a little excluded,

142
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,680
they have exclusive friends,

143
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,600
and they have exclusive life.

144
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,550
They are different type than men are.

145
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,760
Men if they have to get angry with
someone

146
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,600
or if they want to say something

147
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,600
theyâ€™ll just go and have a fight and finish
with it.

148
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,760
But women will keep it in their mind

149
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,600
and will say something,

150
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,790
and it's such a bad thing to start,

151
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,710
it's just like a worm it moves,

152
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,710
and is very infectious.

153
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,590
So all of you must remember

154
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,750
that this is the first thing you must avoid,

155
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,640
is to listen against anyone,

156
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,560
talk against anyone, have small talks.

157
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,950
l have said the same thing in Perth,

158
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,720
because last time when I came I found

159
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,630
horrible things were done against people.

160
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,670
Now again I tell you this,

161
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,830
because we are at a point

162
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,880
where we have to understand that morality

163
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
is not only about what is the sex is,

164
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,870
but is much more than that, much wider
than that.

165
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,880
So because we want to have our
purification,

166
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,680
let us have introspection within ourselves.

167
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,880
People ask Me, ''How did You manage so
well in Russia?''

168
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,800
Yes, one thing about Russia is very great,

169
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,600
that they're very introspective.

170
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,830
lf you read any novel of a Russian writer,

171
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,830
youâ€™ll be surprised to see that

172
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,600
all of them are introspecting,

173
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,560
all the characters are introspective,

174
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,960
they want to see ''Why I do it''.

175
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,680
For example, somebody is lazy.

176
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,920
He doesn't work.

177
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,790
He dedicates his time in reading or
something else

178
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,680
but he cannot put his physical body to any
strain.

179
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,680
Then he introspects: ''Why, why am I so
lazy?

180
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
Why can't I do something more active?''

181
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,790
Then somebody who is always sort of
difficult,

182
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
and angry type,

183
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,670
that people don't like him.

184
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,910
Then instead of getting angry with others,

185
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,600
he has to see himself within himself:

186
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,630
''Why am I not like that,

187
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,590
why people don't care for me,

188
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,880
what do I have within me

189
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,670
that is making me so miserable?''

190
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,680
So youâ€™ll see that you are either
conditioned,

191
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,760
or you have a funny ego which is coming
up,

192
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
and is making you do wrong things

193
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,710
which you should not do.

194
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,880
That's one of the purifications

195
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,680
you can have of your mind

196
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,920
when you start introspecting yourself.

197
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Now as the culture is I find is not very
much

198
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,640
for the benevolence of human beings.

199
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,960
It is, you don't know what people are up to,

200
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,800
what they can do, how far they can go.

201
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,670
Nothing is possible.

202
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,760
l have seen in this, some of the marriages
we had,

203
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
very shocking things,

204
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,840
that the men or women never told Me,

205
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,790
and they had horrible diseases.

206
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,950
And they just put Me into trouble.

207
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,640
There are many others who have done this
kind of thing.

208
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,750
So first thing, you must know

209
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,920
that you cannot be a hypocrite in Sahaja
Yoga.

210
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,720
lf you are a hypocrite,

211
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
if you do not sincerely believe in Sahaja
Yoga,

212
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,590
fully engrossed yourself,

213
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,800
you do not purify yourself and jump into
yourself,

214
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,830
then you will be exposed very soon,

215
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,560
and you'll be thrown away from Sahaja
Yoga,

216
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
no doubt about it.

217
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,840
l will not throw, I will forgive,

218
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
but as I have told you there are two forces

219
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,870
working in Sahaja Yoga,

220
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
one is centrifugal and another centripetal.

221
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,840
By centripetal force youâ€™ll be attracted,

222
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,950
but by centrifugal force youâ€™ll be thrown
out.

223
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,720
So one has to be very, very careful,

224
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,710
because whatever you have got

225
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,600
is something really remarkably,

226
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,680
surprisingly so heavenly, and so easily.

227
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,560
Actually I am surprised at Myself,

228
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
how I have achieved all these things,

229
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,920
but it has been achieved, because as I told
you,

230
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,720
that the all-pervading power itself

231
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,910
has taken a dynamic role.

232
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,720
It is acting

233
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,600
because it is now in, we are in Krita Yuga.

234
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,760
This Krita Yuga comes when there is a gap

235
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,840
between, from one Yuga to another Yuga.

236
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,590
Like we had Kali Yuga.

237
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,640
Kali Yuga has to go to Satya Yuga,

238
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,840
in between there's Krita Yuga, when this
acts

239
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,870
and evolutionary process have taken place
at that time.

240
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,840
So now the last evolution has started and
again,

241
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,600
this all-pervading power has become

242
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,720
very dynamic.

243
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,680
That's how you get all My photographs

244
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,840
and you get all these things,

245
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,840
and you are also getting people realized,

246
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,600
you yourself, you are surprised

247
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,870
at the miracles you have.

248
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,790
Everybody can tell you hundreds of
miracles.

249
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,960
So these miracles also are worked out

250
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,720
by this all-pervading power.

251
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,600
At this juncture, when we have all these
possibilities

252
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,670
if we try to be hypocritical we are harming
ourselves.

253
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,710
lf we try to criticize others, and not
ourselves,

254
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,600
then we are going to miss the bus.

255
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,710
You must understand the importance of
time.

256
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,670
That is something people miss out.

257
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,680
Sahaja Yoga is very good, because you're
blessed,

258
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,960
and you feel that you are secured,

259
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,880
things are very good,

260
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,830
you get so many brothers and sisters,

261
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,840
and I see your faces just like roses shining;

262
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,600
all that is good, but still there is a chance

263
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,950
that you may fall back.

264
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,830
The reason is, you must purify yourself.

265
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,640
Never get satisfied with yourself.

266
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,600
Some people, when I talk to them,

267
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,600
they never think I am talking to them,

268
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,710
they think I am talking to somebody else.

269
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,880
So please try to understand,

270
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,920
we have to introspect ourselves,

271
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,710
we have to meditate,

272
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,670
and when we are conscious about our own
defects,

273
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,760
weâ€™ll start looking at it and theyâ€™ll drop out.

274
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,910
itâ€™s a very tremendous task we have to do,

275
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,630
is to emancipate the whole human beings,

276
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
and for that,

277
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,960
you have to be something very special.

278
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,880
You have to be ideal.

279
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,750
People are going to see you.

280
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,680
l have seen some people who are very
fond

281
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,870
of going on the stage and trying to show
off.

282
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,870
itâ€™s ego, understand that, it is ego.

283
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,960
lf you are not what you are talking,

284
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,910
nobody is going to take you seriously.

285
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,750
On the contrary they'll disappear from
Sahaja Yoga.

286
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,840
lf you are going to show off,

287
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
people will say: ''Look at this show-off''

288
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,710
Everybody can see you being like that.

289
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,910
They may not see themselves,

290
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,590
but they can see another person like that.

291
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,760
So for all these ego manifestations,

292
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,630
you have to be very, very careful.

293
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,630
Now supposing if you have money

294
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,870
then youâ€™ll try to show off,

295
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,790
if you have some power, supposing

296
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,800
you have certain position in the
government,

297
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,800
youâ€™ll try to show off, anything, these
artificial things.

298
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,910
I've known people who show off

299
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,920
for absurd things which has no meaning.

300
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,670
l don't understand,

301
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,760
that these all things are outside,

302
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,720
they are not enriching you,

303
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,630
they are in no way giving you the strength
that you need,

304
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,630
in no way making you beautiful.

305
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,800
So all these outside things anybody can
have,

306
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,670
it's nothing great about you,

307
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,790
but the inner wealth that you develop

308
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,720
is the only way you can purify yourself,

309
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,560
and the resurrection can take place

310
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,600
in the same manner as Christ has said.

311
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,790
Now the time of resurrection has come,

312
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,750
you are all resurrected,

313
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,720
but you have to still cleanse yourself.

314
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,680
First as I told you, that morality

315
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,680
should be the highest priority for all of us.

316
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,790
Now just think of the life people lead.

317
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,640
For example, I have been in the West with
My husband

318
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
in another atmosphere, another society.

319
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,750
We have been to parties,

320
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,600
we've been to all such things,

321
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,840
and what I've found, that no man is safe,

322
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,670
no woman is safe.

323
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,720
They are all flirting with each other,

324
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,550
God knows for what,

325
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,680
it's a joyless pursuit.

326
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,840
And when they go back home what they
find,

327
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,840
that the wife is missing or the husband is
missing.

328
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,560
So such an insecure life they have

329
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,830
because they have no sense of morality.

330
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,640
To them these pleasures are something
great,

331
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,880
and because of this misunderstanding
about the

332
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
life,

333
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,550
they are suffering with such tremendous
insecurity.

334
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,830
You have to guide your children

335
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,750
to a proper, sane morality.

336
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,910
For that you must behave properly.

337
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,550
You should not go romantic in the
presence of your children,

338
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,790
you should not try to put them in a way

339
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,720
that you lock up your rooms and do

340
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,590
all kinds of things,

341
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,950
but behave in a manner that is dignified.

342
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,640
Otherwise children will pick up from you to
begin with.

343
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,560
Then also you should be careful

344
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,840
as to the television and things that they
show,

345
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,680
or what children see,

346
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,590
they have to be careful, and talk to them
that:

347
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,630
''This is wrong. This is very wrong,

348
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,950
and this will bring problems to us.''

349
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,920
lf you have a proper rapport with your
children

350
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,870
you won't have any problem.

351
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,910
You see here they have so much of this
education,

352
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,680
despite that how many problems you have
with children.

353
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,560
While we do not educate children in all
these things,

354
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,680
but we don't have these problems in India,

355
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,760
because you are kept just innocent about
it.

356
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,720
lf the children are kept innocent

357
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,640
they never indulge into it,

358
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,560
and they would never get into any
problems

359
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,640
which are created by curiosity.

360
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,910
Never make them curious.

361
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,870
You will feel happy, the children will feel
happy,

362
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,750
and theyâ€™ll start their life from the very
beginning,

363
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,920
on the basis of morality.

364
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,680
This is what you have to give to your
children,

365
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,790
is a proper moral sense.

366
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,600
Then another thing I have seen is

367
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,870
that, very important, is to give

368
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,910
for Sahaja Yoga your time.

369
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,640
Many people do not give their time,

370
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,790
do not work in the ashrams,

371
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,750
they do not think that they have to do

372
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,670
something for Sahaja Yoga.

373
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,560
You must understand

374
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,920
that you are part and parcel of one body.

375
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,920
Now supposing I do not allow one hand to
work,

376
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,800
put it in a sling, you'll find it will never work,

377
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,670
it will become weak,

378
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,880
it will not be able to do anything, it will be
wasted.

379
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,870
So you have to use all the limbs of the
body

380
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:32,880
in the same way,

381
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,600
you all must also put in physical,

382
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,870
mental, emotional,

383
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,790
whatever is possible for the work of Sahaja
Yoga,

384
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,680
because it is your work.

385
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,880
l don't need Sahaja Yoga,

386
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,680
l don't have to do it.

387
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,910
itâ€™s for you I have started this,

388
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,910
and it is for you to give it to others.

389
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,870
itâ€™s your responsibility,

390
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,910
so you should take it up as your own.

391
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,640
For example you know that at this age

392
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,670
l am traveling every third day or fourth day,

393
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,590
and traveling long distances.

394
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,710
All this I am doing, for what?

395
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,910
There's no need for Me to do,

396
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,710
l don't need anything.

397
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,960
Iâ€™m just doing it because it's supposed to
be My life.

398
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,720
l don't know how to explain why I'm doing it
really.

399
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,950
Logically it doesn't sound sensible.

400
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,840
But if you see Me,

401
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,670
you say that we have great regard for
Mother,

402
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,920
we respect Her very much,

403
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,680
we are very fond of Her,

404
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,640
and we worship Her, all these things.

405
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,680
But do you give so much as She can give?

406
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,840
How much do we give?

407
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,600
Secondly, I have also heard

408
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,600
that people are very miserly in giving
money

409
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,600
for My programs and things.

410
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,760
You want Me to come here.

411
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,680
l used to spend My own money in the early
days,

412
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,720
but you don't want Me to come here

413
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,720
with My own money, is it proper? Is it?

414
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,680
lf you have self-respect you would not like
Me to come,

415
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,800
spend My own money coming here,

416
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,910
and spend money for building this,

417
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,750
and spend money for your car's petrol.

418
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,670
Would you like Me to do that?

419
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,870
No.

420
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,830
So there are many people who come to
My program,

421
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,560
l am told, but do not pay for My programs.

422
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,800
itâ€™s very wrong.

423
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,920
lf you do not pay, I tell you,

424
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,870
immediately you'll suffer,

425
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,560
and that is in money matters,

426
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,670
because if you do not give, money doesn't
come.

427
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,680
Those people who have been generous

428
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,680
with their hands have been very
prosperous,

429
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,560
even in Australia,

430
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,870
even in India.

431
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,670
So I have to tell you, even this is not a
temptation to you,

432
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,640
but when people say, ''Mother, our thing is
not coming up,

433
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,840
this is not working out'',

434
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,880
so there's something wrong, somewhere
wrong.

435
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,920
Once you start dedicating yourself to
Sahaja Yoga,

436
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,710
immediately you'll find things will work out.

437
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,750
Something, there is something you have
done wrong

438
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,630
which you should not have done,

439
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,880
or something is, you have not understood,

440
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,720
you have done something under
misunderstanding,

441
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,920
try to find out.

442
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,830
Things must sort out.

443
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,680
They must soothe out in Sahaja Yoga.

444
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,710
Everything sorts out.

445
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,750
Not only that, but I have seen it just
becomes

446
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,670
absolutely beautifully falling into line,

447
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,760
and you are amazed how it works out.

448
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,800
From a small thing to big thing.

449
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,880
So if it is not working out in your life,

450
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,550
there's definitely something wrong.

451
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,560
So it is the morality of your,

452
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,640
l should say, financial morality.

453
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,670
Also there were some horrible mishaps

454
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,760
we had in this country of yours,

455
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,670
where horrible leaders came

456
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,550
who were interested only in money,

457
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,830
that's how they came to Sahaja Yoga,

458
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,760
and what has happened to them, you
know that well.

459
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,560
So you don't come to Sahaja Yoga for
money,

460
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,560
you come here for everything,

461
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,630
in a sense, in totality,

462
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,600
you have to get that higher situation.

463
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Like that you have to

464
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
give also,

465
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,670
with an open heart.

466
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,800
Know that you have got such a great gift,

467
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,720
so now, what can I do about it?

468
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,640
Of course I don't need your money,

469
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,600
l am not in the same position as even
Christ was,

470
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,870
but He never took any money.

471
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,600
So I need not take any money from you.

472
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,710
But still, for other things,

473
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,560
those people who have not paid should
remember

474
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,710
that if they want their children to be all
right,

475
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,560
if they want their family to be all right,

476
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,710
if they want to be

477
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,870
all right as far as the money is concerned,

478
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,880
without feeling the ego,

479
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,670
without pressurizing the leaders,

480
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,760
try to spend money in a way

481
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,640
that is really useful for Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,880
Then another point is about the family,

483
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,910
as I told you yesterday, that:

484
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,600
''My house, I must have my house, I must,
yes''.

485
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,870
Specially leaders' wives.

486
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
Again I should warn them, because

487
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,870
all this has created problems to such an
extent now,

488
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,920
that we had to throw them out of Sahaja
Yoga.

489
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,910
Despite the fact husbands were very good,

490
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,840
but some women wanted to have their own
home,

491
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,840
they wanted to have their own children,

492
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,840
they wanted to stay in their own.

493
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,800
So this kind of a thing if a leaderâ€™s wife has
ideas,

494
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,800
then what will happen to others?

495
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,920
They have to follow an example

496
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,710
that is that of a leader,

497
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,720
and if a leader doesn't have that

498
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,800
and the wife doesn't have that example,

499
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,910
the whole thing can be absolutely in a

500
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,680
state of jeopardy,

501
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,910
and that's what I've seen,

502
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,870
that people suffer so much

503
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,880
when they do not realize

504
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,870
that we all are part and parcel of one
family.

505
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,560
And we start thinking, imagine,

506
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,880
we cut one finger and plant it somewhere,

507
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,670
what will grow out of it?

508
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,600
Will a tree grow out of it?

509
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,710
or what will grow out of it?

510
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,720
Nothing. It will stick.

511
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,710
Till you were not joined with that whole
thing

512
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,830
you were all right,

513
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,880
whether you were rotting in a place

514
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,560
or wherever you were, doesn't matter,

515
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,960
but when now you have joined,

516
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,750
and when you are part and parcel of the
family,

517
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,920
then see how you behave, how your
children are.

518
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,680
Are they collective?

519
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,640
Are they sharing or they are fighting?

520
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,830
Try to see that your children can share

521
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,750
their things with others.

522
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,640
And you first of all start doing that,

523
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,640
otherwise children cannot do it.

524
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,910
Now look at Christ,

525
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,680
He lived hardly for four years,

526
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,920
in the sense that He was out of

527
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,960
that country.

528
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,880
Only for four years He could work out the

529
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,630
mission that He had to fulfill.

530
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,910
So He was

531
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,590
only there

532
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,720
to achieve this resurrection at the Agnya
chakra.

533
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,600
In that short period,

534
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,670
how many beautiful parables He has
given,

535
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,870
how many places He has been,

536
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,750
how many people He has talked to.

537
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,920
All His life He has spent like this.

538
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,760
He lived in a very simple manner,

539
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,640
and He had no such tents, or anything,

540
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,800
so He used to go on mountains and
Mount,

541
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,800
you know, Sermon on the Mount is very
famous,

542
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,910
sermons are, and then He would gather
people there

543
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,640
and talk with them.

544
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,600
They would listen to Him.

545
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,760
But nobody imbibed anything that He said.

546
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,710
Very few that He had, about twelve
disciples,

547
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,710
who also understood Him when He died,

548
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,600
before that they did not understand what
He was.

549
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,830
They could not

550
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,920
visualize actually within their minds,

551
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,550
''What is He doing,

552
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,840
what is He talking?''

553
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,640
But when He was resurrected that made
them think:

554
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,840
''Who was He, and what He has done?

555
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,720
How is it we are His disciples?''

556
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,920
And they were ordinary fishermen,

557
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,710
you know that very well,

558
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,960
but their intelligence suddenly manifested,

559
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,720
their dynamism manifested,

560
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,590
and they really showed such good ways

561
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,600
of achieving

562
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,800
what we can call the second birth.

563
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,840
Also, Christianity spread under wrong
banner

564
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,790
of Paul and Augustine,

565
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,640
and that's how we see the problems of
Christianity.

566
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,950
So much so that we are shocked.

567
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,720
How can Christianity of Christ would be
like this?

568
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,680
But it is,

569
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,560
and this Christianity of Christ that has
come

570
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,630
has nothing to do with Christ.

571
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,790
And He has said it:

572
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,590
''Youâ€™ll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ,'

573
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,550
l won't recognize you.''

574
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,880
We are the people who are carrying this.

575
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,880
And also He has said that theyâ€™ll be
wearing

576
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,670
a mark on their heads

577
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,760
and I will know who are the ones.

578
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,840
So, as it is, you are already marked,

579
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,800
you are already been chosen by Christ

580
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,870
in His Last Judgment,

581
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,830
He has chosen you and you are there,

582
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,560
but still one should know that

583
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,670
there is all the possibility

584
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,600
that we could be hypocrites,

585
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,710
that we are playing with only words,

586
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,710
could be that we still have to cleanse
ourselves.

587
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,760
So just put your mind into yourself,

588
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,550
and see for yourself

589
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,720
that: ''Where have I done wrong?''

590
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,760
As far as Mooladhara is concerned,

591
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,640
you people have a special responsibility.

592
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,720
Australians have the greater responsibility

593
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,960
than anybody else,

594
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,760
because this is the place of Shri Ganesha.

595
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,800
And if you do not fully understand

596
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,800
the significance of mooladhara clearing,

597
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,800
Iâ€™m sure you won't be able to achieve

598
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,880
any height in Sahaja Yoga.

599
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,560
So all of you should decide about this,

600
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,670
and work it out so that there is no problem

601
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,790
of your ascent, or your rising,

602
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,600
because you're so pure or so beautiful.

603
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,590
All this you have achieved already,

604
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,840
without much difficulty.

605
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,920
Only thing is if those things which are left
behind,

606
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,680
suddenly are trying to come up also,

607
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,640
you should not allow it to come into your
life,

608
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,910
you should just throw away.

609
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,790
For example like a lotus leaf,

610
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,920
when it is under the water it doesn't show
anything,

611
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,790
but when it comes up,

612
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,640
then water doesn't stand on that,

613
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,800
it just falls off.

614
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,880
Doesn't get attached to any water.

615
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,960
You may pour water, any amount - it just
takes off.

616
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,750
So this is what you have to find out.

617
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,950
Relationships between each other,

618
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,880
racialism and other things,

619
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,920
we have to just oppose it.

620
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,790
itâ€™s not a good thing to hate anyone

621
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,830
for anything small like that.

622
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,560
The forgiving quality of Christ

623
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,880
at the time when He was crucified

624
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,670
has to be remembered.

625
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,680
How He forgave those who crucified Him

626
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,800
because they do not know what they are
doing.

627
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,750
But even when they know

628
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,720
what they are doing in Sahaja Yoga,

629
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,870
still people try to crucify.

630
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,870
And this crucifixion can be

631
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,680
all right for the person who is crucified,

632
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,800
but very dangerous for the person who is
crucifying.

633
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,880
So this has to be understood,

634
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,670
that to get rid of all these things,

635
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,560
and to get out of all your crucifixions,

636
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,830
you have to have an extremely pure,

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,680
ideal, beautiful life.

638
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,950
You should be proud of your virtues.

639
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,600
You should be proud of your greatness.

640
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,790
You should be proud that you are so
righteous.

641
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,880
There's nothing to feel bad about.

642
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,920
Otherwise people will boast about their
bad things

643
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,840
as in the modern times,

644
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,800
but not about their good things,

645
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,750
regarded as bad manners.

646
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,870
You need not boast of both the things,

647
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,830
but you can be proud

648
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,920
of the things that are so beautiful,

649
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,720
so nice, so energy-giving.

650
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,720
Christ had to surrender to the desire of His
Father,

651
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,680
and He asked Him that:

652
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,790
''If You could take away this cup, it would
be nice.''

653
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,600
But when the Father said: ''No,

654
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,630
you have to drink this cup,''

655
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,640
He accepted, and He went through it

656
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,720
very bravely, and beautifully.

657
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,640
We have to have the same kind of
surrender,

658
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,720
that whatever we have to do,

659
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,720
we should do it with a surrender.

660
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,590
We should not think

661
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,920
that we are achieving something by that,

662
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,600
we are showing off by that, or anything.

663
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,830
Just you should feel that it's being done

664
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,760
because we are surrendering.

665
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,680
We should feel our surrender as a great
blessing.

666
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,880
lf you can put your attention to your heart,

667
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,600
and just say that: ''l surrender myself',

668
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,790
that's more than sufficient.

669
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,670
But you shouldn't say that: ''Mother, please

670
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,910
help me to surrender.''

671
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,830
l mean, how can Mother help you?

672
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,600
All these prayers sometimes are

673
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,680
escapes from reality.

674
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,600
''You just help me, help me, this.''

675
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,760
To surrender is very easy.

676
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,760
Just you have to say: ''Mother, come in my
heart,

677
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,950
and come in my head,

678
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,680
and come in my attention,''

679
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,870
that's all.

680
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,790
Go on saying like that:

681
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,630
''Please come in my heart,

682
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,920
come in my head,

683
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,870
and come in my attention'',

684
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,830
and as you would go on saying, Kundalini
will rise

685
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,920
and She will cleanse you completely.

686
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,590
She's the One who cleanses you.

687
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,750
All the time She's cleansing your chakras.

688
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,640
But problem is we always spoil them.

689
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,800
Again and again,

690
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,760
both thing again and again rises and does
that.

691
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,920
So all these problems are

692
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,550
because we are not introspecting.

693
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,910
Also I've seen people are very attach to
their wife

694
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,870
or attached to their husbands,

695
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,590
then they cannot see anybody else.

696
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,920
For them, everything is wrong but for
themselves,

697
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,920
not their husbands or their wives.

698
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,640
This is, seems to be very common failure.

699
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,640
This kind of false attachment

700
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,880
not only will harm another person,

701
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,880
but will harm your husband or your wife.

702
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,630
Because they will also get away with
wrong things.

703
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,710
Once they start getting away with wrong
things,

704
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,960
there's no end to it,

705
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,790
and theyâ€™ll be destroyed.

706
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,870
Now the task before Me is to go to

707
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,750
area of Visshuddhi, in America,

708
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,920
which is another very difficult task.

709
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,840
And unless and until that is put right,

710
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,790
My throat cannot be all right,

711
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,720
so I have to jolly well do it,

712
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,590
and I have to work it out.

713
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,870
But as you know, Americans have

714
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,680
something wrong with their upper storey.

715
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,630
l just don't understand.

716
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,910
They like people who take money from
them

717
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,720
and who befool them,

718
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,960
who have Rolls Royces, all kinds of things,

719
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,560
can you imagine?

720
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,800
They would not have Me on the television,

721
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,550
because I have no Rolls Royce.

722
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,760
l mean, in the television, in the
government,

723
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,840
can you imagine such a television where
they don't

724
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,800
take you up because you have no Rolls
Royces?

725
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,720
itâ€™s not prestigious.

726
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,640
lf I have a Rolls Royce by cheating
everyone,

727
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,910
then it's very prestigious, it's a business.

728
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,950
So, with all these things happening,

729
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,600
one feels that the level of spirituality

730
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,640
is really great

731
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,600
in a place like Australia

732
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,710
which is cut off from the world,

733
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,790
which is so much away.

734
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,680
The spirituality is very well expressed here

735
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,590
and I'm sure in Sahaja Yoga they will rise
very high,

736
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,710
if they keep to one understanding,

737
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,880
that they are living on the

738
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,630
soil of Shri Ganesha.

739
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,760
How important it is,

740
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,910
how you live,

741
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,870
with what purity

742
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,840
and with what understanding.

743
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,960
So today is the day of Christ's resurrection,

744
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,920
you should say, it's a resurrection for all of
us.

745
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,630
He has the One, He is the One who
managed it,

746
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,960
who did everything for us,

747
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,670
and He's the One who has helped us so
much,

748
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,840
otherwise Kundalini well

749
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,920
could never have entered into Sahasrara.

750
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,640
So one has to be really very much thankful
to Him

751
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,870
from your heart,

752
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,870
plus you should try to imbibe His qualities.

753
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,960
One other quality is there, of course,

754
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,590
that when people try to criticize your
Mother

755
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,750
or try to insult your Mother,

756
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,920
you get angry, that is just like Christ,

757
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,840
He could not tolerate any insult,

758
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,750
or any kind of a neglect of His Mother.

759
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,920
He Himself has said that this will not be
tolerated.

760
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,910
In the same way you people also,

761
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,600
if you have only for that, I am with you.

762
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,870
Iâ€™m absolutely with you,

763
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,830
that you do not have

764
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,800
any more the feeling

765
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,560
of

766
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,870
guilt, or anything within yourself.

767
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,920
When you understand

768
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,710
that whatever you are doing,

769
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,640
you are doing with complete sincerity,

770
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,920
with complete understanding.

771
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,870
Even if you make mistakes, it doesn't
matter.

772
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,840
The mistake will bring forth something lack,

773
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,680
but you have to be extremely sincere,

774
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,600
this feeling should be within you.

775
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,630
Look at the feeling of Christ.

776
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,800
l mean, He crucified Himself.

777
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,800
He asked for the trouble.

778
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,640
He went all the way there,

779
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,750
there was no need for Him to go,

780
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,950
enter into that area,

781
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,830
and He got this.

782
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,710
Of course,

783
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,720
you are not going to be crucified

784
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,760
now for your resurrection, not at all,

785
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,670
but

786
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,600
in a way

787
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,630
you have to crucify whatever is ugly,

788
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,800
whatever is wrong,

789
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,920
whatever is detrimental to your growth.

790
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,790
You have to become really very beautiful
people,

791
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,790
very beautiful.

792
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,640
Anybody who talks to you,

793
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,800
anybody who sees you should say that:

794
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,720
''I met such and such person, very
beautiful,

795
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,680
and then I asked, 'How is it you're so
beautiful?'

796
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,920
and the person said that 'Iâ€™m a Sahaja
Yogini'''.

797
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,950
itâ€™s a very, very common

798
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,920
experience of Mine,

799
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,790
very common experience.

800
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,680
And the main thing is

801
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,720
that you have to respect

802
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,670
your self-realization,

803
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,800
your resurrection has to be respected.

804
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,640
lf you do not respect your resurrection,

805
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,560
you are not going to help yourself or
others.

806
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,750
l met once by chance,

807
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,880
the High Court Judge of Hague High
Court,

808
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,670
which is a World High Court.

809
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,800
Just in Romania.

810
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,600
He was sitting there.

811
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,800
l was also sitting, and he was looking at
Me.

812
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,600
Trying to locate him, I couldn't locate him.

813
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,640
And then we went to Paris,

814
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,880
and he was also in Paris.

815
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,720
Frankfurt, he was changing,

816
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,670
and I was also changing there.

817
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,630
So he just came and asked: ''By the way,

818
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,640
have I met You before?''

819
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,880
l said: ''Maybe.''

820
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,790
l knew who he was but I kept quiet.

821
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,560
He said: ''You know I'm such and such,

822
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,790
and I went to India

823
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,870
and there was a lady who cured me,

824
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,640
are You the one?''

825
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,760
l said: ''Yes, I am such and such''.

826
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,840
All right.

827
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,750
Then what he told Me was most
encouraging, was this.

828
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,720
He said: ''That time You cured me I felt
gratified,

829
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,640
l thought You were one of the healers and
all that.

830
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,640
But when I saw the life of Dr Nagen,

831
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,560
this is my colleague, the way he's
transformed,

832
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,920
the way he had become such a good man,

833
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,840
such a wonderful person, I asked him
once:

834
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,720
'What, what has made you so good,

835
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,830
how can you be such a good man in these
bad times,

836
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,870
when from every side there's such an
attack?'''

837
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,910
And also he took a very big stand.

838
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,920
'''And what, what was the thing?

839
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,720
What made you such a good person?

840
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,680
You are living in a place like this,

841
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,630
and you know how

842
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,630
Hague is surrounded by all kinds of
criminals

843
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,950
and drugs and all that.

844
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,910
And you are such a nice, and a beautiful
saintly person.

845
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,960
What has made you?'''

846
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,670
''So then he told me,

847
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,590
'You remember the lady who cured you,

848
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,710
She has changed me completely.

849
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,950
It is because of Her I have become a Yogi,

850
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,750
and that's why my life has changed,

851
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,600
because it gives you the strength.'''

852
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,880
So this man told Me, I was really very
much touched.

853
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,830
So he said: ''Now can I have Your
photograph?''

854
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,710
l said: ''l don't have any photograph.''

855
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,750
There were three, four Sahaja Yogis with
Me,

856
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,590
they were wearing the badges,

857
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,870
but only there was one badge.

858
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,590
But the Secretary of the Hague High Court

859
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,960
was also with him.

860
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,960
He got so much interested, so he said:

861
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,720
''Can I have the badge?''

862
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,600
So we gave it to this judge, so the other
fellow says:

863
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,680
''What about me?

864
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,550
l would also like to have a badge.''

865
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,790
l said: ''Are you going to carry this badge?''

866
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,560
''Yes, yes, of course.'' immediately he wore
it.

867
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,590
Suddenly Matteus found another badge,

868
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,630
but they had gone to the airplane.

869
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,830
Then he ran there and he told the air
hostess:

870
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:41,950
''Give it to the gentleman.''

871
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,720
''Ah, I saw one with this badge. All right,

872
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,880
Iâ€™ll give it to the other.'' And she took it
inside.

873
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,790
Can you imagine these people of such
high society,

874
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,880
l should say, so highly placed in life,

875
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,590
such intellectuals,

876
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,720
they are the judges of the Supreme High
Court,

877
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,830
in the sense that it's the super, most

878
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,800
High Court in Hague, World High Court,

879
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,590
and so humbled down, because

880
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,920
of one person whom they saw so changed.

881
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,710
So you can imagine how you can change
your colleagues,

882
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,840
how you can show better results

883
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,800
by your proper dignified behavior.

884
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,720
itâ€™s going to work out very well if you have
that example.

885
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,760
And Christ, why He impressed people so
much?

886
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,920
Because of His personal life.

887
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,910
In His personal life He showed

888
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,830
how powerful He was,

889
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,920
and then, and His death, He showed

890
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,670
by His resurrection that He was something

891
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,560
beyond human comprehension,

892
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,560
where He has just become

893
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,840
resurrected after death.

894
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,840
Must be that He was absolutely purity
personified,

895
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,560
which He was.

896
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,640
So today we have to place ourselves

897
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,960
in such a manner

898
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,800
that we ask for purity, and purity, and purity,

899
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,560
and that we are going to work out

900
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,800
this purity within ourselves with full
sincerity.

901
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,560
We are not going to get into ego trip,

902
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,760
and think that we are perfectly all right. No,

903
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,600
we are just going to ask

904
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,720
for complete purity within ourselves.

905
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,880
This is what the great, what Christ has
given us,

906
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,800
which we should achieve,

907
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,880
and we should really show

908
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,590
that we can achieve that purity within
ourselves.

909
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,630
Whatever has happened you forget it,

910
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,790
you don't worry on that point,

911
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,750
whatever has happened is a gone case,

912
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,560
but whatever has to happen is this,

913
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,910
that you all should ask for purity,

914
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,870
all criticism, all hatred

915
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,880
and all those things will disappear,

916
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,670
plus the purity will give you

917
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,600
that unique position

918
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,880
that when people will even see your life,

919
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:56,950
they will change.

920
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,640
Only by seeing your life, they will change.

921
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,680
l hope this works out very well here,

922
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,750
and maybe by the time I come next time,

923
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,840
weâ€™ll have lots, lots of Sahaja Yogis,

924
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,720
beautifully connected to each other,

925
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,560
beautifully having relations with each other,

926
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,910
and these children growing up

927
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,960
very fast as well.

928
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,640
l hope to come back here

929
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,750
again to the land of Shri Ganesha

930
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,910
where Purity has taken over.

931
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,800
May God Bless You.

932
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,600
Easter Puja is a simple Puja in a way,

933
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,590
because we just...

934
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,630
of course the Footwashing has to be there
by children,

935
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,800
because that's the special day today,

936
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,880
but otherwise it's a much simpler Puja,

937
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,630
and it doesn't take all those things that

938
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,880
we normally do.
