00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:04,817
Shivaratri Puja, Pratisthan, India, 2003-0228

2
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:14,247
Lord Shiva's biggest quality is forgiveness.

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:22,000
If he doesn’t forgive, then nothing will be spared.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,088
He is very forgiving

5
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,232
and because of his forgiving nature, we are surviving.

6
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:34,913
otherwise we would have been finished.

7
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,756
from such great god (Mahadev)

8
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:47,624
we should ask him such qualities as forgiving nature

9
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:58,599
like his character, like his powers. Despite such qualities he is full forgiveness,

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,748
he takes into consideration that we are humans and he forgives.

11
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:09,048
We should take his quality (guna) of forgiveness.

12
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:14,551
We do not have such behaviour in which we forgive

13
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:21,113
We cling to small petty things and fight.

14
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:33,934
This is not Mahadev’s puja, those who follow him should forgive everyone.

15
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:37,250
Anyone can commit mistake

16
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:42,095
Everyone has some faults,

17
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:45,658
Instead of looking at their faults you look at your own.

18
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:49,127
and forgive the faults of others.

19
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:52,642
This is very great quality of his to forgive

20
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:59,828
and that quality in human race is very rare.

21
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:03,492
There was time when there were many forgiving people

22
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:14,839
but now don’t know how people consider anger as a big thing

23
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:18,612
and they are not even ashamed of it.

24
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:22,364
But if you are a worshiper of Mahadev(Shiva)

25
00:02:22,564 --> 00:02:32,362
and if you consider Shankar (Shiva) as your Guru

26
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:42,079
then you have to be forgiving in nature like him.

27
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:49,366
And despite such powers, if he wants he can destroy anyone.

28
00:02:49,566 --> 00:03:01,852
This is how his power of forgiveness (audio not clear)

29
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,313
Many people worship Shivji to seek his forgiveness.

30
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,859
“ Oh! God Forgive us”

31
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:23,147
but he is all-forgiving in nature.

32
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:29,915
And his forgiveness has magnanimity.

33
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:35,556
Those who cannot forgive cannot be Sahaj yogis.

34
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,768
The first proof of a Sahaj Yogi is that

35
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,743
he is forgiving in nature from the heart.

36
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:48,719
and he does not calculate what wrong has been done to him.

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,593
Forgiveness is like ocean

38
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:57,133
and to we have to settle in this forgiveness in ourselves.

39
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:06,318
Then only Mahadev will be established inside us.

40
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:15,943
But I still see that see that we get angry first instead of forgiving.

41
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:18,076
forgiveness should come.

42
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:21,334
and if you do not know how to forgive,

43
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:24,936
then you wont be able to live in this world.

44
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:29,839
You will live but you will be always angry with someone

45
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:37,944
you will be always unhappy with others.

46
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,276
Shivji always lives in bliss.

47
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:52,980
But when he sees that someone is becoming like Rakshasa

48
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:01,515
then even with the opening of his one eye that person is destroyed.

49
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,459
That much power he has !

50
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:08,526
and because he has so many powers that is why

51
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,925
that is why he can forgive.

52
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:17,177
So in all the powers he has

53
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:25,971
their essence is that he uses them to forgive.

54
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:33,303
Those who worship Shivji they have to measure for themselves

55
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:39,771
that how much can we be forgiving ,how many can we forgive.

56
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:45,284
In reality this is only the real criteria.

57
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:48,833
But the anger which resides in us

58
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:59,015
makes us feel that should correct this person or that person.

59
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,366
This is not a right thing.

60
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,078
Who are you to correct people?

61
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:07,905
If Shivji is not even correcting them then who are you to do that!

62
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:14,647
In this way, imagining anything about yourself is wrong.

63
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:21,005
And by forgiving our heart becomes big

64
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:26,654
and we can ascend to higher position.

65
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:30,059
There are various things in life and amongst them

66
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:37,147
I think that for a human to forgive is a big thing.

67
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:40,337
Because that is very difficult for him.

68
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:47,921
He gets angry on any issue and unhappy with anything.

69
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:52,282
And there is no meaning in becoming unhappy

70
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:57,575
 there is no substance in it.

71
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:07,086
Either you should have the power of Prem (love) through which

72
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:13,819
you can understand others or the power of Anand (Happiness/Enjoyment)

73
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,328
I find it difficult that humans are still on the same level

74
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:28,614
despite realization,feeling vibrations and becoming stable in all aspects.

75
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:32,954
but the capacity of forgiveness is very less.

76
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,837
so this is wrong.

77
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:40,719
Getting angry and upset on small things

78
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,211
is not the feature of bhakta (worshiper) of Mahadev.

79
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:53,911
and those who do his bhakti, their behaviour is full of Shanti (Calm)

80
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,948
because they don’t get angry, such a person cannot remain upset.

81
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:11,066
so such type of person has higher power of forgiveness.

82
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:17,233
There are many things in which you should not get entangled.

83
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:23,821
And you should try as much as possible to forgive (Kshama)

84
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:29,600
This is the essence of Mahadev’s life.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,309
In our country, we had many great saints and

86
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:48,140
here,in my opinion generally, we also had big incarnations (Avtarans).

87
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,610
But today, the whole world believes in Shiv.

88
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,366
It is because he can forgive.

89
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,837
And this his special quality.

90
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:06,200
The remaining other powers he has

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,661
we can only achieve it if we learn to forgive.

92
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:14,734
If we do not know how to forgive anyone then

93
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:20,567
we can't even reach near his feet.

94
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:25,450
In this world, mistakes always happen, after all it is human.

95
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,798
But to trouble any human

96
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:34,859
means distancing ourselves away from Mahadeva

97
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:40,177
He has forgiven great Sins and Rakshasas

98
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:45,961
From this he has learned what is love.

99
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:57,257
And in love, a human should forgive.

100
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:04,496
So the people who have forgiving nature, they do not develop anger.

101
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:09,229
In any case they have to forgive,so why to develop anger.

102
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:13,147
And it is reflected on their face.

103
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:19,192
They are very simple and loving people.

104
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:26,166
So we have to measure,how much can we forgive.

105
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:30,848
And how many people can we forgive.

106
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,642
You have the example of Isa Masi (Jesus Christ)

107
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:38,387
When they were crucifying him, he said to the God

108
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:42,649
"They don’t know what they are doing. So forgive them"

109
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:46,061
He was saying it to Mahadev

110
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:53,902
They were doing such a big sin, yet he asked for forgiving them.

111
00:10:54,102 --> 00:11:00,771
Based on our health, our heart,this quality (guna)

112
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,713
 of forgiveness manifests proportionally.

113
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:08,826
But I see that as time is passing this quality is decreasing.

114
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:17,498
Mostly……. Somebody is angry

115
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:27,285
In this way, many people take to the wrong path and call it Dharma.

116
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:31,023
Where there is no Shiv, there is no Dharma.

117
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:37,482
That is why, today we have to promise that,

118
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:45,277
if we have complications or anger against anyone we must forgive them.

119
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:58,649
I do agree that, there are many sins from which we cannot be saved.

120
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:07,943
But if you believe in Shivji, you will be surprised

121
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,451
that you will not be touched by any sin,as your heart is so big

122
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:17,480
because your heart is full of Shivji

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,533
and it will realize it and act on it.

124
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:29,984
So insulting anyone, underestimating others is wrong.

125
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:34,331
Who are we to insult others?

126
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:42,586
Humans due to ego do things like that, this is all the shadow of ego.

127
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:50,999
And Shiv is such that, he has no ego at all.

128
00:12:51,199 --> 00:13:01,917
He has powers (shakti),despite being aware of them, he doesn’t gets angry.

129
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:09,002
Because he is aware of his powers and that he can destroy anyone into ashes(Bhasm)

130
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:19,186
That is why he maintains control, and is very much forgiving in nature.

131
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:26,357
So we also have to decide today that we will not get angry on anyone,

132
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:31,143
we will not look for shortcomings in others but ours.

133
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,125
And getting angry on others it is a great sin

134
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,934
because you are Sahaj Yogis.

135
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:41,030
Hope now onwards you will become

136
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,494
real followers (Bhaktas) of Shiv.Eternal Blessings.
