1
00:00:02,136 --> 00:00:05,221
 

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:10,546
You see, because I try to know so much about religions.

3
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:15,135
Because I’m dealing with all kinds of religious people, first of all.

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:21,068
And then, you see, within ourselves, it’s - there is a religion, a human religion.

5
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:25,596
That is actually our valency, it’s our valency.

6
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,596
Our wellbeing?

7
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:34,207
Valency is a thing like carbon has four valencies, we have also ten valencies within ourselves.

8
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:35,461
I don’t know this word.

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:43,492
Valency is a word of chemical, chemistry, valency, v-a-l-e-n-c-y. Valency.

10
00:00:43,492 --> 00:00:47,098
And is it something new going, an expression?

11
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:50,710
Well it is within us, you see, this ten qualities a human being has.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,492
We have ten valencies.

13
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:57,358
Ten valences. And once we are missing in that, then we are missing in our personality.

14
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:03,957
And it seems, that you have all sorts of relationship with people’s psyche

15
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:08,568
 and the problems they have, but we will always say there are psychosomatic.

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:20,223
Yes. Psychosomatic diseases or human physical diseases all are because we are very much going into extremes, you see.

17
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:24,553
So, there are imbalances in our character.

18
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:34,717
Given that you are living in London it must be odd of you- I mean [unclear] not even from your own bags.

19
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:37,734
Well, it started in India, I shouldn’t say that.

20
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:38,234
You did!

21
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:41,726
It first started first. First, first twelve Sahaja Yogis were from India.

22
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,524
The first twelve

23
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,394
Sahaja Yogis. They are called as Sahaja Yogis - Yogis

24
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:50,630
Oh, yes, right. You’re the founder of the-

25
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes, I’m the founder as you said.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,703
And was it nineteen seventy?

27
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:54,908
Yes.

28
00:01:56,298 --> 00:02:01,621
And I believe Australia now is the first growing?

29
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,265
Yes, it is, it’s something really remarkable I tell you.

30
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,836
And this must go like this the last six or seven years.

31
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:12,600
Yes. Suddenly, you see, I think Australians have a quality of innocence in them.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,147
Right.

33
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,162
They have.

34
00:02:15,162 --> 00:02:21,638
And you [unclear] to the fact that it is the first "chakel" of Sahaja Yoga- you call it the "chakel"?

35
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:23,844
Chakra.

36
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:32,384
Chakra, yes. And first charka is Australia and New Zealand, yes, first chakra of innocence.

37
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,181
 Ok, which makes us more-

38
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:40,436
Innocent, yes. You are innocent people.

39
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:45,191
Calibre also because of innocence- calibre. But you are very innocent.

40
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:51,211
But you understand innocence and you respect innocence also, I think.

41
00:02:53,338 --> 00:03:02,755
And obviously, you had a time with the background Rajneshes and you totally discredit him.

42
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:09,434
Does that make difficult, does that make people more resistant to listen to you or?

43
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:12,275
I believe you denounced him.

44
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,157
Absolutely, all of them. I ‘ve denounce all of them, openly.

45
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,242
All of them.

46
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,242
With the name.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,423
You see this is a- you see, what are they there for? That’s the main point is, you see?

48
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:28,101
They are just there for making money, that’s all.

49
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:28,601
Right.

50
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:34,919
The incredible part of this is that you get the experience yourself.

51
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,868
Right.

52
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,279
You certify yourself. the other day we were in New Zealand.

53
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:41,205
And we had lots of people, the whole hall was filled.

54
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:49,409
Some were sitting even on the ground. And when they got their Realization they said: "It was like a -"

55
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,689
what‘d you say to the, when you open the bottle of Champagne?

56
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,725
 Booze, booze, "It came out like a booze!" They said "Mother".

57
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:59,348
Yes, so many of them.

58
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,348
And this is-you’re just talking to them, sitting [inaudible]

59
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:07,728
No, I just - I was talking to them and I told them how you can raise your residual force,

60
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:14,416
the Kundalini, the force that gives you Realization. That is the reflection of the Holy Ghost with us.

61
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:18,315
Christians also don’t know what’s the Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost is the Kundalini,

62
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:22,117
which is the residual force in the triangular bone, you see?

63
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:26,589
And when it humps, they make them rise, rise it, with their own hands

64
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:30,000
and then suddenly they felt the booze coming out of their heads.

65
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:37,812
Right. So, if I went along and I was sceptical, and I went to the meeting

66
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:44,140
and I went through the mechanics of, of – how you would you describe

67
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,924
Sometimes, the reporters also get it, surprisingly.

68
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:51,782
They’re cynical, I Think.  Because they meet all kind of funny people, I tell you,

69
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:54,905
So, it’s difficult to believe in a genuine person, you see,

70
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:59,246
There are very few genuine people in this world. So, the whole attitude is different.

71
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:04,060
All right, yes. And when that resistance stops.

72
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,197
It’s that, even if they, I mean, they just don’t want to have it, you see, you cannot force it on anyone.

73
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:12,468
And you’re not about to force it on anyone.

74
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:15,723
Not at all. You have to ask it from your heart

75
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:21,330
because Holy Ghost is the pure desire within you, pure desire to be one with the Divine.

76
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:29,666
And you would not want to identify one single God or entity.

77
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:37,973
No, not at all, it’s not that way. It’s all of them, all of the incarnations, every one of them, are the milestones of our evolution.

78
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:44,355
of our evolution. And this is the evolutionary process,

79
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:49,305
the epitome of the last breakthrough of our evolutionary process.

80
00:05:49,305 --> 00:06:00,000
Can you explain to me a question apparently a gentleman did not know you few days ago, and he has found what you believe may be a cure for AIDS or,

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,728
can you explain that? Cause you know that’s going to cause all sorts of reactions.

82
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:11,666
Ha. AIDS. Now, AIDS, so far, I did definitely cure one person, no doubt.

83
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,659
Yes, and it’s only the one person.

84
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,185
One person. But he came from TM.

85
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:19,947
Transcendental Meditation.

86
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,133
Trans-Med.

87
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:21,811
Right.

88
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:25,944
Now, I told him not to go to in near it again and finish it off.

89
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:28,140
Ho, really? Why?

90
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:34,073
Because they try all these entities and those things just to capture your attention and capture you.

91
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,505
Well, they have a whole philosophy, you mean.

92
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:40,200
All like that. They mesmerize actually.

93
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,964
This fellow, he was treated, he was all right. The doctors said that he had not this thing in his blood.

94
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:50,031
His parents were very happy. 
But again, he went to the same.

95
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:54,349
Naturally, you feel, you see –then he died also.

96
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:58,916
He came back to me. I said: “Now I cannot treat you”. “Now it’s alright, finished”.

97
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,306
 “I cannot go on all the time. Why did you go? I mean I told you.”

98
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:08,171
Yes. This is the man that became IO and was looking to TM for relaxation

99
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,709
No, no, no, no, no. He was in TM.

100
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:16,839
And there, I don’t know, he became homosexual because in the TM, in those days-

101
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,202
you are not supposed to even see your wife, you see,

102
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:23,341
you have to live with men, you’re forced.

103
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:25,076
You don't.

104
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:31,721
No, no, no! All this nonsense, we don’t believe in all this nonsense. No, no! You have to be married; you have to happy husband and wife.

105
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,061
And you didn’t believe in funny clothes.

106
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:35,485
No, no, no, no, nothing.

107
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:36,279
Or begging on the street, or.

108
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,279
No. We have to be very normal people.

109
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,025
Right.

110
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,179
Or else that sets you apart from every other.

111
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:53,363
Yes, of course. I mean because they must have some sort of an advertising or sensation.

112
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:58,482
So, they do all these things, you see. I don’t need that. It’s a question of becoming.

113
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:05,670
Can you explain to me this question of apparently this AID's cure is ingested gold?

114
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,553
You might try gold.

115
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,160
You're trying it really, you're not so -

116
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I haven't yet and we are trying still.

117
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,539
[Inaudible]

118
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:19,751
Yes, it is, you see. But I thought that copper can cover, the copper can be covered with gold.

119
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,710
Why using copper?

120
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,600
It is caused by copper. I know for 
definite it is caused by copper [unsure].

121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,192
AIDS are caused by the copper viruses. The copper 
are the carriers of viruses 

122
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,480
and the viruses of those-

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,647
Mineral copper.

124
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:43,889
Yes, in the blood. And, you see, when 
they have these relations you know, it's a dirty point, 

125
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:47,983
and the viruses and dead things are there, and viruses you see, 

126
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:51,653
and the skin is very loose there.

127
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:52,153
Yes.

128
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:58,067
It passes into the blood and is then it, it stays on the copper. 

129
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:01,796
You have seen copper becoming green, have you? 

130
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:02,296
Yes.

131
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:07,357
It becomes like that. Now when it covers that copper,

132
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:09,698
it can move about in the blood.

133
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:13,046
Without developing into the secondary stages?

134
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,042
Oh, it is on in the, first of all, in the first 
stage all right? 

135
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:17,605
Yes.

136
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:25,335
Then it attacks the antibodies.

137
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Antibodies are created in the center, here. 

138
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,852
The gold attacks the antibodies. 

139
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:37,287
No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying the copper, the virus.

140
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,181
Right.

141
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,177
Now the antibodies are created in this part, the sternum. 

142
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,708
Yes.

143
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:55,094
Till the age of 12 years or so and then they disappear they are all in the body, you see. 

144
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,436
Now when they start attacking the antibodies,

145
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,331
then so many antibodies die after.

146
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,144
Yes.

147
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:10,348
And they can't find fight this virus

148
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,480
So, this because of the dead tissues 
and also it grows more. Because it's a fungus,

149
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
it's a kind of virus, this kind of fungus, 
it grows on something that is dead.

150
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,099
Right. 

151
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:25,338
So, it starts growing more and more, you see.

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:36,072
But now, if you now put copper, cover it 
with gold, supposing, try, I mean but try,

153
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
of course with Realization, I 
brought this man to this level

154
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,269
that his blood was cleared out 
because it's a cleansing process.

155
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,054
That's a different point. 

156
00:10:46,054 --> 00:10:49,458
So, I request you one more time. You say the copper is the min-

157
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:57,282
It's happening in the medical, it's happening with 
the medical side of it. But actually, in our Sahaja Yoga,

158
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:07,918
we don't have to do all these things. We 
raise your kundalini. Once the kundalini comes up,

159
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,473
Sorry, that's just a subtle mental suggestion. 

160
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:15,245
That's just, if the doctors want to try, they can try also you see. 

161
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:18,873
But so when the kundalini comes up,

162
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,822
And this is the Self-realization.

163
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,266
The Self-realization. Then, you see, now these are the, say,  

164
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:30,839
these are the centers you see? Now by too much of pull on them, say, here, in the center here, center heart

165
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,845
Yes.

166
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,924
This center gets attacked by these 
people- viruses. So, it gets strong

167
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,800
because the kundalini passes through 
that it enlightens it, it gets strong.

168
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,280
When it gets strong, it starts producing more and 
more antibodies. So, now the antibodies attack.

169
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,476
The reverse process starts.

170
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,035
The viruses. So, the viruses start running away from the body like that,

171
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:05,212
it's the other way round. 

172
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
All right, but that obviously will be 
a bone of contention, won't it? I guess.

173
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,595
No, no it is why it has worked. In those people who 
had AIDS, we have three or four of them on the list now.

174
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:19,310
Worldwide.

175
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,840
Yes. There are four of them at least are there, worldwide.

176
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,752
Are dead. 

177
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:33,255
No living, living, and they got AIDS about, I 
think, two years back 

178
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:36,254
or they came to Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,040
and we gave them Realization, two years 
back we gave them Realization.  

180
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,997
I don't know how many years they have AIDS, you see.

181
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:51,423
And now they are at the same stage as the first stage. They have receded back to the first stage. 

182
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:52,921
They still got the antibodies. 

183
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:54,676
They still got, I mean if- 

184
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:56,676
[Inaudible]

185
00:12:56,676 --> 00:13:03,456
It is in four stages, that's in four states. So, now they have gone back to the first stage, all of them.

186
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:06,320
 Were they at the first stage when you met them?

187
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,003
I don't know. I didn't have their [inaudible] but they 
were saying so. They have gone back.

188
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:17,283
So, now, they are leading a normal health. Normally 
what happens with this, that one gets diarrhoea.

189
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,490
You get perspiration at wrong times all 
these things happen. They have started doing all that.

190
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,674
All that stopped and now they are at 
the first stage.

191
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,785
So, they had their [inaudible] at that stage.

192
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:40,000
They are coming back to only that part. So, maybe, they 
might jump out also. 

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,320
In fact what you're saying is supported by some research here in south Australia which is the only one in the world

194
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,360
that's looking at the effect of your mind on how 
the body whether the AIDS becomes a full-blown

195
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,611
disease or whether it stays in a and you're 
arguing that with that Self-realization they're better.

196
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:04,400
No, no that is the centre, you see you can 
see on the when the kundalini moves, you see?

197
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,874
You can see it with your own eyes also on some people. 

198
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:08,619
Really?

199
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:09,119
Yes.

200
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,000
That's done naturally?

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,805
You see, because it's an energy that moves on your backbone, right?

202
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:26,850
But what happens that you see it clearly in the cases of people who have obstructions in their chakras but if they are open it just shoots off.

203
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,894
Now on these people, you can see it it's there, it 
stops there.

204
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:38,710
Also, can feel it. You see, on your fingertips, after Realization, you can feel where the kundalini is, 

205
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,275
where she is obstructed. 

206
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:50,320
So, you find out that it is obstructed here. Now when you find out it's obstructed here, you have to- a little bit- to move,

207
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,957
you see, that obstruction. Because the hands, from 
the fingertips the vibrations are flowing.

208
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,124
So, you can remove the obstruction.

209
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:00,497
Can you explain me how it's a physical thing? 

210
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,317
You see, after Realization what happens, your hands start emitting 
a kind of an energy, a cool breeze from your hand

211
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,728
This is the cool breeze you told. 

212
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:13,763
Yes, the cool breeze and also you can feel
 the good breeze all around you.

213
00:15:13,763 --> 00:15:25,603
it's true, it happens to you. All right. Now this is the vital 
energy from your hand with which Christ has cured.

214
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:34,898
So if you move- it gets complicated.

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,143
Because you asked me about gold, I had to tell 
you the doctor's things. But actually, we don't do that.

216
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:45,600
We actually don't do all that. No, what we do is to give Realization that's all.

217
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,544
And you start moving the kundalini upward, you start 
moving it. 

218
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:53,070
So, the gold therapy is just something [unclear]

219
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,106
Yes, if they want to try, they can try that. 

220
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:55,920
But you're not really-

221
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,407
No, no, we don't try all that, we don't try. 

222
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,983
But didn't you do that in Melbourne for somebody?

223
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,502
No, no, no, no. I told them that if you want you can. 

224
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,766
Oh, I see, yes, yes.

225
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:07,317
But I didn't try on them.

226
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:10,000
No, no. You really unconstitutional [unsure]

227
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,763
You see, what we do is to raise
the kundalini all the time at this point.

228
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:16,640
So, it gets more light
and more light and more light

229
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,154
and it becomes a strong center. 

230
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:22,240
Can you tell me,  is it something that can just happen

231
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,261
on one occasion and then you're okay for, you feel 
better for it, or do you have to work on it again?

232
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:34,797
You see, one has to work I think, because it's 
an age-old problem I think, with some people.

233
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,501
But in certain things, it happens just like that 
also, just like that. 

234
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:46,800
So, many things you get cured without any difficulties but 
some things you have to work out also.

235
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,820
It is individual. It depends on everybody's -

236
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,202
Everybody's individual-

237
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:53,770
Yes, style.

238
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:01,365
So, you cannot say that everything could be that way. But 
so many diseases get better at a very short time.

239
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,609
Well, I won't hold you up anymore you must 
be very tired after you -

240
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,380
No, I'm not.

241
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,741
I'm quite- I don't get too easily tired. 

242
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:12,241
No?

243
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,089
Not much, yes. 

244
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,404
And your husband is still in London?

245
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:21,005
Yes. He's in in London. Now, today, he's in Rome. He 
telephoned to me. 

246
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,191
Right. So, you keep in touch with him.

247
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,597
He travels a lot himself. 

248
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:26,667
Right. And you must be doing a lot of traveling. 

249
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:31,947
Yes, I travel with him also I travel for Sahaja Yoga. There's a double town [unsure]. 

250
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:35,811
My brother is with me
he is a high court judge from Bombay. He sits here.

251
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:39,231
Yes, I gather you've been travelling with [unclear].

252
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,209
I will, perhaps I can get 
your name from your [unclear].

253
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,878
V.P. Salve.

254
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:56,596
V.P. S-A-L-V-E 

255
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,646
Judge, high court judge of Bombay.

256
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:03,247
Bombay, stationed at Aurangabad.

257
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,804
You'll have to give me the spelling of that too. 

258
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:10,966
A-U-R-A-N-G-A

259
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,337
BA- B-A.

260
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,343
Where you have [inaudible].

261
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:18,539
Yes, yes. All right?

262
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,145
Thank you very much. And your title is that of 
high court judge. 

263
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,133
Yes, yes.

264
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,133
All right. [Inaudible].

265
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:34,399
He himself was not a believer of God in the beginning. 

266
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,195
You support your sister now. 

267
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,686
Now he's all right.

268
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,890
How long did you have to work on him? 

269
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,315
You see, being the sister, naturally, it takes time.

270
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:50,821
[Inaudible] in between. 

271
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:57,764
But not with false gurus. I've seen the false people get all their relations together to make money. I don't know. 

272
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:03,470
My family is a very, 
I should say, idealistic family.

273
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,870
And by, you see, not that he didn't believe in me he 
always believed in me and my love.

274
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,862
But he never believed that I could change people or 
transform people, you see? 

275
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:20,236
After I saw the Sahaja Yogis, from a very near point 

276
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:23,857
 that I was convinced 
that what she says is right. 

277
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:25,620
Really? And how long ago you took to-

278
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,991
It's only about two- one and a half years. 

279
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:34,146
Since I became a high court judge and was stationed at Aurangabad, I could have some more time. 

280
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:37,977
I was a lawyer, a practicing lawyer that didn't give me time.

281
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,800
 And his diabetes is cured and also, he 
could not bend himself, he bends himself well. 

282
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,200
I was not able to bend at all. 

283
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,743
These legs they're all very stiff.

284
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:56,000
Really, it's a lovely angle, I must admit.

285
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,127
Terrific! And oh, I ought to ask your age. Do I ask your age? 

286
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:02,176
Age?

287
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:02,676
Yes.

288
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:03,489
My age?

289
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:05,489
I am sixty-one. 

290
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:10,770
He is sixty-one. I am sixty-four. Now running sixty-fifth.

291
00:20:12,717 --> 00:20:15,805
Maybe, I'll be sixty-one in June.

292
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:19,087
I'm sure [inaudible].

293
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:25,303
All right then. I will leave you now. Do you have photos?

294
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:29,661
We have lots of them. Find me some miraculous ones, you may like.  

295
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,373
We had some very miraculous photographs 
of mine. You would like to see some?

296
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,007
Have you brought up the hands?

297
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,960
The latest yes, we have, let us take this.

298
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,636
[Inaudible] showing something you will 
be interested.

299
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:45,139
We are getting out of the way. 

300
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:50,758
I met some of you

301
00:20:50,758 --> 00:20:52,758
 

302
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:57,531
Dan your home work is very well. You see, if they have done home work well, their hand are all right. 

303
00:20:57,531 --> 00:21:00,950
Otherwise, it's a problem. [Unsure].

304
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:08,436
Have you got some photographs?

305
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,093
He explained to me supreme court is equal to our high court.

306
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:29,823
Oh so it's topsy-turvy, the other way around. 

307
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:38,698
I don't practice this [inaudible]

308
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,873
because I'm born like this, I don't have to be cleared. But all of them practice.

309
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:50,960
It takes only five minutes in the morning and five minutes in the evening, twice a day, that’s all. Yes, that’s all.

310
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,443
It's not a regular thing or else. It's something that happens to you.

311
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,960
You are in meditation. 

312
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,785
And you become a person who is meditating 
because you are in contact with the Divine.

313
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:08,721
Then you don't have to worry.  That's it. It's simple.

314
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:17,755
 

315
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,741
You were in May?

316
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
I was there in November, December.  

317
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,125
Oh that's beautiful!

318
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,946
Yes, it's a very pleasant place 

319
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:35,946
Oh, but Jane's going next week. 

320
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:42,779
Thank you very much. 

321
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,779
Thank you, thank you.

322
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:48,126
I think I will go tomorrow at one of these meetings. 

323
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,217
You must come along, you see. 

324
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:51,395
Oh, I'll be coming along. 

325
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:52,455
 

326
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,225
I think that’s ashram in Melbourne. 

327
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:59,821
All right then you can send 
some to Paul to see for himself, you see.

328
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,012
 

329
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:10,000
You both should come tomorrow get your Realization.

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 

331
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,920
But how was that picture taken, with what?

332
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,030
A camera.

333
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,840
You might get something in yours.

334
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:30,532
Even in a village, I was sitting. 

335
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:35,796
[Unclear] she got lights coming out of my head [unclear].

336
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:47,534
Thank you, than you.

337
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,946
Lots of them are there, but you don' carry that load with you. 

338
00:24:06,794 --> 00:24:11,846
What about them? You should offer them some tea. 

339
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,585
They won't have some tea or something? Ask them.
