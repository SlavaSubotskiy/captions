1
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:07,238
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

2
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:21,790
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

3
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,315
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

4
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:30,057
and so we are going to have the puja

5
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,688
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,027
As the housewife has to finish every work,

7
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:44,032
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

8
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,632
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

9
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:51,930
and then I could come for your puja,

10
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:55,077
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

11
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:58,976
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

12
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:07,271
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

13
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:13,342
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

14
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:17,059
it’s not a human being’s creation

15
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:23,678
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

16
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:32,916
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

17
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:37,517
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

18
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:44,379
Now She is always born in a relationship

19
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:54,045
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

20
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,015
So She comes as sister or

21
00:01:58,273 --> 00:02:01,431
She comes as a daughter.

22
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:07,540
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

23
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,426
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

24
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:19,099
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

25
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:23,439
the religion into their hands

26
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:27,269
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

27
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:31,480
The attention was not paid so much

28
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,784
towards the ascent of the person.

29
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:40,130
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

30
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:42,773
And He is the only one -

31
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:47,059
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

32
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:51,327
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

33
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,644
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

34
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:58,943
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
 [brother of Jnaneshwara],

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,435
which, you can go to Pune,

36
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,498
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

37
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:42,965
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

38
00:03:43,963 --> 00:03:48,996
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

39
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:56,950
She stayed in her house, in her household

40
00:03:57,546 --> 00:04:01,511
and She observed what you call

41
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,894
a kind of a panda
 [? Pata: veil]

42
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:10,882
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

43
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,886
It is a symbol that a woman

44
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:20,747
who is a housewife has to

45
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:31,647
save her chastity by covering her face because

46
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,332
She was a beautiful woman and

47
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:43,016
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

48
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,958
and She would have been definitely attacked

49
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,493
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

50
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:54,609
As you know, in the time of Christ,

51
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:59,207
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

52
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,799
had to be very, very potential personality

53
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:07,351
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

54
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,716
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

55
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:20,532
so She allowed her sons

56
00:05:20,814 --> 00:05:23,671
or actually ordered them

57
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,184
to fight those fanatics

58
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:33,119
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

59
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:38,195
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

60
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:41,897
It’s a very beautiful thing how

61
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,403
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

62
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,517
took a form of Vishnumaya

63
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,929
just to establish the beautiful principle of

64
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:05,628
a housewife.

65
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:10,608
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

66
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,415
and She knew that her children will be killed.

67
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:19,827
But these people are never killed,

68
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:23,242
they never die nor do they suffer.

69
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,904
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

70
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,026
As a result of that,

71
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:38,518
another system started where they respected saints;

72
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,699
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

73
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,435
or we can call them the people

74
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,580
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

75
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,004
Then we have got “Chisti”.

76
00:06:55,293 --> 00:07:01,258
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

77
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:05,214
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

78
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:09,949
But still they could not transcend

79
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:16,671
the limits of religiosity.

80
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,438
So they also became extremely fanatic.

81
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:27,260
Firstly they would not see to

82
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:31,479
another religion where they had saints.

83
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:35,890
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

84
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:42,840
and even when we had a great saint

85
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,600
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

86
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:55,539
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

87
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:59,938
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

88
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:05,880
We did not deny,

89
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,655
as far as Hindus were concerned,

90
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:14,485
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

91
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,950
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

92
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,143
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

93
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:28,063
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

94
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:31,996
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

95
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:34,681
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

96
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,432
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

97
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:45,673
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

98
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:50,690
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

99
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,012
So they could not get out of it.

100
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:56,452
So we have another one called Haji Malang

101
00:08:56,587 --> 00:09:00,200
who was worshipped by Hindus.

102
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,839
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

103
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,957
This Haji Malang

104
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:14,221
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

105
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:18,639
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

106
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,198
just to counter balance.

107
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:23,454
They did all kinds of things.

108
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,497
There are many saints like that.

109
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:33,606
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

110
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:39,835
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

111
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,446
of that place, which was very bad. Even

112
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,599
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

113
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,253
They all make an earnings,

114
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:53,850
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

115
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,995
So this saint died and was buried there.

116
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,650
There were many people who were depending on it.

117
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:07,301
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

118
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,471
 'What is your religion?'

119
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,873
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

120
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:16,478
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

121
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:19,362
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

122
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:24,591
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

123
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:26,694
They have no religions.

124
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,769
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

125
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:36,633
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

126
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,163
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

127
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:43,951
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

128
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,670
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

129
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:49,435
that they made a fanatic group.

130
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,620
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

131
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:58,866
against your innate religion within your-self

132
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,723
because it creates poison.

133
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,602
It's a venomous thing.

134
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:09,025
It makes you hate others.

135
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:12,094
When you start hating others,

136
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,144
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

137
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,880
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

138
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,936
Hating any one

139
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:31,129
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

140
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:34,631
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,454
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

142
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:40,115
They bite some one because that is their nature.

143
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,889
They cut some one because that's their nature.

144
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,113
They never hate someone.

145
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:49,061
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

146
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:54,431
is a speciality of human conception

147
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,141
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

148
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:03,490
And this horrible thing hatred

149
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:08,667
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

150
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,586
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

151
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:18,909
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

152
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,380
in every religion.

153
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,767
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

154
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:31,746
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

155
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:37,829
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

156
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:43,669
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

157
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,348
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

158
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,731
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

159
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,564
to overcome that hatred,

160
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:04,982
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

161
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,939
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

162
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:13,323
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

163
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:19,552
How? In the family when you have a household,

164
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:28,864
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

165
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:35,816
between the children, between the husband and the children.

166
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:41,060
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

167
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,645
then how can she subdue it?

168
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:49,863
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

169
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:53,065
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

170
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:56,099
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

171
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:01,765
But the housewife's job is to smooth

172
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,147
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

173
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,734
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

174
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,625
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

175
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:24,089
'wherever the housewife is respected,

176
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:27,665
there only the Gods reside'.

177
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:34,711
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

178
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,137
because we are no good for economics,

179
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:41,163
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

180
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,968
Men folk are useless,

181
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:45,914
they don't know any household work or anything,

182
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:49,470
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

183
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:52,143
 is maintained by the women of the household.

184
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,316
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

185
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:04,855
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

186
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:08,350
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

187
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:14,271
It's like the preservation of that

188
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:21,093
principle of a housewife.

189
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:26,259
But some men, I mean many of them,

190
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,930
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

191
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:35,331
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

192
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:39,939
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

193
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,200
 But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

194
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,139
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

195
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:50,276
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

196
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:55,377
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

197
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,508
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

198
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:03,767
 [you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

199
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,056
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

200
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:10,448
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

201
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:12,873
they have no love or respect for each other

202
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:15,947
but they have an awe or fear.

203
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:19,801
And they are afraid of such a woman.

204
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:24,954
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
 the husbands are better controlled.

205
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:30,374
But their basic principle they lose.

206
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:33,861
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

207
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:38,756
and they land up in difficulties.

208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,627
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

209
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,200
 is to respect her chastity,

210
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:52,604
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

211
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,348
That is the steadiness of her.

212
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:59,483
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

213
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,934
If the wife is docile or obedient,

214
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:10,911
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
 Alright!

215
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,860
 But this woman, the housewife,

216
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:21,659
has to know that she is not docile.

217
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:27,268
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

218
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:33,299
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

219
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,614
If the husband is stupid, alright,

220
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:40,275
he's stupid like a child, finished!

221
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,938
But the husband has to know that he must

222
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:47,194
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

223
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:50,275
he's good for nothing.

224
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,053
First thing is that he must see

225
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:59,961
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

226
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,704
Then the blessings flow.

227
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:08,502
But in no way he should insult her

228
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,932
 or be unkind to her

229
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,410
 and raise his voice or say things to her.

230
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:21,000
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

231
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:24,512
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

232
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:28,131
 give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

233
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:31,632
She has not to be dominating,

234
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:35,896
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

235
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:39,021
She is the source of peace,

236
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:43,320
she is the source of joy

237
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,140
and she is the peacemaker.

238
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:49,801
If she is the one who creates problems,

239
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,146
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

240
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,781
 So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

241
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:04,714
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

242
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:10,212
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

243
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:14,318
your left Nabhi can never improve.

244
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:22,017
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

245
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:26,069
 Now in the west the problem with women

246
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:30,510
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

247
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:38,901
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

248
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:44,501
 They do not feel their dignity 
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

249
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:47,379
They are the queen of the house

250
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,287
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

251
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:53,573
young frivolous girl.

252
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:58,365
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

253
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:02,593
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

254
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:07,567
that, does not behove a housewife.

255
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:10,411
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

256
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:14,613
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

257
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,791
and when they have to fight.

258
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:21,312
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

259
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:25,545
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
 that's the limit!

260
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:32,847
 They start always comparing themselves

261
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,471
with the husband, to begin with.

262
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:40,243
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

263
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:43,928
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

264
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,473
low family he has no money,

265
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:49,118
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

266
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:52,099
 Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

267
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:56,157
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

268
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:03,252
Also in her own ways

269
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,366
she will feel guilty,

270
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:09,623
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

271
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:13,769
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

272
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:21,493
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

273
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:26,171
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

274
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:30,497
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

275
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,013
by your strength, by everything

276
00:21:36,383 --> 00:21:40,473
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

277
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:46,988
by dominating others, by strangling others,

278
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:51,580
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

279
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,445
frog in the well.

280
00:21:58,556 --> 00:22:02,428
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

281
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:04,135
Lets have our house separately,

282
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,328
nobody should come in the house'.
 Even a rat won't enter that house.

283
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:14,460
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

284
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:20,166
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,726
is the negative form of understanding.

286
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:28,087
These are absolutely absurd things,

287
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:32,779
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

288
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,244
 All this kind of selfishness,

289
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,302
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:22:44,886 --> 00:22:47,658
But a thing of a housewife is,

291
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:51,287
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

292
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,332
 For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

293
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,953
 So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

294
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,413
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

295
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,413
 'But may be they would like to eat more.'

296
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:06,250
 'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

297
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,236
 'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

298
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:13,289
So she thinks of her generosity.

299
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,267
She enjoys her generosity.

300
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:17,418
I have known many like that.

301
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:20,457
 Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

302
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,001
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

303
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:26,977
 will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

304
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:29,255
 you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

305
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:32,172
 No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

306
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,351
Then she just start thinking immediately.

307
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:37,410
'What vegetables are available in the market?

308
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:39,817
What should I get? What is the best?'

309
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:44,824
 I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

310
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,245
I am just a relation,

311
00:23:48,088 --> 00:23:51,225
but they want to express their love through the food,

312
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:56,277
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

313
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,195
and this is one of  the quality,

314
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,695
 the generosity for woman doesn't have

315
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:06,295
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

316
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:11,556
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

317
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,404
but wife has to be very generous

318
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:19,213
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

319
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,695
not to her own children but to others.

320
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:30,020
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:34,009
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

322
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:38,901
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:44,606
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

324
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:49,953
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

325
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:56,683
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

326
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:01,425
 but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

327
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:06,940
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

328
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:10,461
about your own understanding.

329
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,200
You are not aware of yourself.

330
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:18,959
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

331
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:23,305
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

332
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,979
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

333
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:30,844
  Alright, leave it for a while.

334
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,208
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

335
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:36,129
 'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

336
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:40,898
The women must understand the men.

337
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,963
 They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

338
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,762
They see everything in a big way, you see.

339
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:53,289
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

340
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,235
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

341
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,195
They are too above these things.

342
00:25:58,565 --> 00:26:02,482
They are above these things. You must understand that!

343
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:08,361
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse 
and fall down.

344
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:11,944
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

345
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:16,099
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

346
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:20,152
It is coming to that point.

347
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:23,307
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

348
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:26,452
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

349
00:26:26,556 --> 00:26:29,129
without any moustaches.

350
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,955
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

351
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,871
But there is no subordination of any kind.

352
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,317
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

353
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,756
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

354
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,658
and, above all, to your righteousness

355
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,106
 because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

356
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,175
has to look after that side.

357
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,401
How many quarrels you create?

358
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:04,993
How can you be quarrelsome 
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

359
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,812
Supposing we send two peacemakers

360
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:11,746
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

361
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,201
what will you say to such a thing?

362
00:27:16,912 --> 00:27:20,191
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

363
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:25,712
you have  the one who has to bring such

364
00:27:27,098 --> 00:27:31,052
expression of love, such sweet things

365
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:40,069
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

366
00:27:40,604 --> 00:27:42,587
because you are the mother.

367
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:45,717
The family must feel secured within you

368
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:49,960
 and this love is your power.

369
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:55,062
 This is your power that you can give love

370
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:59,940
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

371
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,850
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

372
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:07,350
 I don't know I'll have to build another house!

373
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,788
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

374
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,677
 I will not take any individual presents."

375
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,385
Now still despite that. I don't know,

376
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:20,268
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

377
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:25,687
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

378
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,911
You are some times surprised.

379
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:33,894
 I'll give you one simple example of my own life

380
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,604
which will tell you how love can work it out.

381
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:41,544
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

382
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,501
And once I was in Delhi,

383
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:49,640
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

384
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:51,208
sitting outside in the lawn,

385
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:55,315
 when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

386
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:57,985
and they came and said, "See now we are...

387
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:01,606
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

388
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:04,396
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

389
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:05,795
and he is a Muslim,

390
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,201
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

391
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,002
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

392
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:13,312
 they were quite alright.

393
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,907
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

394
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,348
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

395
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:21,533
and a bathroom and this thing,

396
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,180
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

397
00:29:24,313 --> 00:29:26,569
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

398
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:29,947
In the evening my brother came in.

399
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,947
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

400
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,116
he said "What is this?

401
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,402
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

402
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:39,644
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

403
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:41,532
my husband came, he also joined him

404
00:29:41,636 --> 00:29:44,905
 because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

405
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:47,925
All men just the same, you see,

406
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:50,159
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

407
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,192
she has kept these three persons here.

408
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,297
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

409
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:57,801
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

410
00:29:57,937 --> 00:30:01,129
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

411
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,758
all kind of things.

412
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:06,342
Next morning they forgot about that.

413
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,781
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

414
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,268
I can't drag them out today, one night."

415
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,867
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

416
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,289
That's like men!

417
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:18,353
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

418
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:21,849
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

419
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:25,009
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

420
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:28,038
Next morning they went away for their work.

421
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:30,736
 They had no time. It was, you see,

422
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:34,365
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

423
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,709
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

424
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:42,260
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

425
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:45,806
Then this lady got a job

426
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:52,344
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

427
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,179
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

428
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:04,400
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

429
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:06,666
It had a reflection in Delhi

430
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:09,079
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

431
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:13,433
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

432
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:17,223
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

433
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,368
I said, "No. How can I have?"

434
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,023
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

435
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:25,208
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi), 
can you believe it

436
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,720
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

437
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:32,104
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

438
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,628
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

439
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:41,184
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

440
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:42,850
because I will not allow you!"

441
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,112
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

442
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:50,099
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

443
00:31:50,237 --> 00:31:52,144
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

444
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,811
 I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

445
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,583
His life was saved.

446
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:59,556
 Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

447
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:02,691
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

448
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,174
and this lady became a great actress,

449
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:09,519
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

450
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:12,201
 the one who used to act like a mother?

451
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:16,852
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

452
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,809
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

453
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:22,777
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

454
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:26,146
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

455
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:28,118
they will just go mad about Me,"

456
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,411
and I said "I have no time for all that."

457
00:32:30,753 --> 00:32:35,560
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

458
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:36,865
to give them some good films.

459
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:39,644
But it all made into a farce, later on.

460
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:42,018
 They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

461
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:46,790
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

462
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:48,788
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

463
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,010
 I have said, I have anything to do with it."

464
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:57,389
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

465
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,158
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

466
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,946
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

467
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:07,837
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

468
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,331
You will have to give me Sari.

469
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,173
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

470
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,181
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

471
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,024
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

472
00:33:15,136 --> 00:33:17,921
 big muhurat is the one where you start it.

473
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:22,017
 So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

474
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:24,276
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

475
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:26,064
 that she has seen Me after twelve years.

476
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,290
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

477
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:31,425
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

478
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:34,031
fell into my arms

479
00:33:34,454 --> 00:33:37,996
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

480
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:40,149
I have been trying to trace you out."

481
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:43,606
Then she started describing Me and all.

482
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:46,537
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

483
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:49,793
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

484
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:53,084
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

485
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:54,885
we'll give our lives for Her!"

486
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,509
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

487
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,250
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

488
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:01,531
Nothing doing. "

489
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
 See now,

490
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:06,399
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

491
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:10,355
I didn't have so many rights on

492
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:14,139
my husband's property, or anything,

493
00:34:14,243 --> 00:34:16,403
and my brother another dominating fellow,

494
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:19,262
both of them put together,

495
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,899
just were about to kill me that night,

496
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:25,753
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

497
00:34:26,555 --> 00:34:28,845
and then you know when I told my husband

498
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,084
and my brother, they were amazed.

499
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,753
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

500
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:35,699
 and see the change,

501
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:38,465
how much they have...",

502
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,747
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

503
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,685
no to any charitable institution.

504
00:34:43,796 --> 00:34:45,718
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

505
00:34:45,885 --> 00:34:50,905
And the whole idea of a...

506
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:56,005
earning and money just toppled down.

507
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:59,523
And she has acted in many films for charity

508
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:04,863
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

509
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:12,418
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

510
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,733
because she herself is charitable.

511
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:19,148
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

512
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:22,716
And she can create beauty around her,

513
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,959
in her household, in her family, in her society.

514
00:35:27,118 --> 00:35:28,962
Everywhere. But no!

515
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:32,583
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

516
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:37,867
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

517
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:41,740
 [UNCLEAR]

518
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,891
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

519
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,018
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

520
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:56,212
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

521
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,858
and that they have to be told.

522
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:01,361
But this is not the way!

523
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:07,379
 There is another way of improving these men, who try to

524
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,196
destroy the women,

525
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:15,405
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

526
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:20,466
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

527
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,708
He will never side with men if they are chaste

528
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,942
and do not try to show off their body

529
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,775
 and show off their beauty and want to make,

530
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:32,312
sort of, a capital out of it.

531
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:39,120
Such women are extremely powerful,

532
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:43,142
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

533
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,946
when it comes to anything

534
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:48,607
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

535
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,506
She fought the British.

536
00:36:50,713 --> 00:36:52,453
And the British also

537
00:36:52,874 --> 00:36:55,130
were surprised at her valour and they said that

538
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:56,854
we had got Jhansi, alright,

539
00:36:57,307 --> 00:37:00,143
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

540
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:05,673
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

541
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:09,390
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

542
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,972
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

543
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,892
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

544
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,489
who have been great women, who were housewives.

545
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:30,634
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

546
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:32,425
or potential of any energy.

547
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:35,473
 Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

548
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,928
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

549
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:41,407
 one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

550
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,644
So one has to understand that we are potential

551
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:48,789
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

552
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:51,855
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

553
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:55,686
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

554
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,093
 But men are another stupid stuff

555
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:01,184
because they will not respect a woman

556
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:03,956
who loves them, who is chaste,

557
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,324
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

558
00:38:07,478 --> 00:38:10,479
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

559
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:14,101
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

560
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,541
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

561
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:21,753
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

562
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,964
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

563
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:33,765
 What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

564
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,966
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

565
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,700
that the way they get attracted.

566
00:38:39,232 --> 00:38:42,093
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

567
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,507
women become very insecure

568
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:47,495
and they get insecured. As a result,

569
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:50,292
the men suffer and women suffer.

570
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,938
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

571
00:38:55,298 --> 00:39:00,387
will consequently get blood cancer.

572
00:39:08,408 --> 00:39:10,606
And the woman who behaves like this,

573
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:17,511
in this manner and if she ill-treats

574
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,276
her husband, will get asthma

575
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:27,283
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

576
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:33,256
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

577
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,874
could be complete dehydration of the body.

578
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,747
Because left nabhi is so important.

579
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,183
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

580
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:55,050
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

581
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:59,792
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

582
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,783
I have always seen

583
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:06,330
 that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

584
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:10,989
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

585
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,491
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

586
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:16,112
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

587
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,638
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

588
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:22,833
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

589
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:27,227
He gets something for the jumping

590
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:31,159
and she gets something for her torturing.

591
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:36,148
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

592
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:42,189
This so-called figure madness,

593
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:45,961
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

594
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:51,291
 It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

595
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:57,059
Women have to be settled down women.

596
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:00,303
They have to be Grahasthis,

597
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:03,026
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

598
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,664
 Said to be satisfied with her household.

599
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:08,097
If she is all the time running about,

600
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,781
 she doesn't want to stay in the house

601
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:14,094
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

602
00:41:16,523 --> 00:41:21,301
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

603
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:23,716
and then she was made a housewife

604
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,132
but she could not stop her running about

605
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:28,228
because she was a maid servant.

606
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:32,021
She doesn't settle in the household.

607
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:36,198
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

608
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:39,670
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

609
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:42,088
but for others to welcome.

610
00:41:42,787 --> 00:41:45,806
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

611
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,250
 to come and sit and enjoy.

612
00:41:49,345 --> 00:41:51,810
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

613
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:54,717
we find that people, after marriage,

614
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:59,118
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

615
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:04,260
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

616
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:07,778
and disobedient, torturesome.

617
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,994
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

618
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:16,102
Not that I punish this,

619
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:18,646
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

620
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:21,697
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

621
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,951
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

622
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:30,511
Then children become funny.

623
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:34,621
 Just for your family, just for your food,

624
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,249
just for your household, this selfishness,

625
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:42,655
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

626
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:45,799
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

627
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:48,771
but if the man is a gone case,

628
00:42:52,423 --> 00:42:54,773
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

629
00:42:54,918 --> 00:42:58,264
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

630
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:04,286
Our family is not of one man one woman

631
00:43:04,646 --> 00:43:07,142
but the whole universe is our family.

632
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:11,894
We are not on our own,

633
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:16,020
 and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

634
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:19,531
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

635
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:22,575
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

636
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,377
a day will come,

637
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:29,108
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

638
00:43:29,938 --> 00:43:34,950
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

639
00:43:35,058 --> 00:43:37,972
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

640
00:43:40,855 --> 00:43:45,125
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

641
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:49,106
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

642
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:50,449
group of women,

643
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:54,757
 she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

644
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:04,334
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

645
00:44:04,471 --> 00:44:08,098
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

646
00:44:08,308 --> 00:44:11,871
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

647
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:19,096
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

648
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:22,536
Not because it is a punishment from God.

649
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:29,691
 So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

650
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:36,238
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

651
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:40,342
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

652
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,231
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

653
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,611
Those women who have tried such tricks,

654
00:44:54,497 --> 00:44:57,599
 should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

655
00:44:57,715 --> 00:44:59,791
Nobody respects such a woman.

656
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:04,507
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

657
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:08,105
The leader's wife or the leadership

658
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:15,779
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

659
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,491
Most insignificant.

660
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:24,765
What you got is much higher than this.

661
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:31,681
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

662
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,781
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

663
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,692
Is the minimal of minimal.

664
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:44,719
Is the lowest of lowest.

665
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:48,873
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

666
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,933
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

667
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:58,212
But that service itself is enjoyment.

668
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:01,355
 But if you just keep to service.

669
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:05,669
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

670
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:12,195
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

671
00:46:12,865 --> 00:46:15,000
You can be used for a cross!

672
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:22,487
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

673
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:26,334
 unless and until you have that essence

674
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:29,862
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

675
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:36,817
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

676
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:41,983
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

677
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:44,272
then what is left?

678
00:46:45,352 --> 00:46:48,474
In the same way, all the so-called service

679
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,952
and seva and tapasya

680
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:54,439
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

681
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:59,509
So the essence of all this is sweetness

682
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,642
and that is generated by women.

683
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:08,038
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

684
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:10,134
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

685
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:13,685
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

686
00:47:19,218 --> 00:47:22,638
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

687
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,835
It's a good thing in a way.

688
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:31,132
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

689
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:37,761
But to make him all the time slave,

690
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,689
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

691
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:43,073
Is not the job of a housewife!

692
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:52,316
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain? 
Nothing.

693
00:47:53,554 --> 00:47:54,919
She gives you everything.

694
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:58,125
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

695
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,221
Such powers She has.

696
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,301
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

697
00:48:03,796 --> 00:48:07,464
 You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

698
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,285
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

699
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:15,933
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

700
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:18,643
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

701
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,440
Least expected!

702
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,309
Never in life-time.

703
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:27,598
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

704
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,891
First time, I said something and see the effect.

705
00:48:29,995 --> 00:48:32,518
Because I've never said him!

706
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:38,604
 So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

707
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:41,297
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

708
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,277
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

709
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:47,184
She has to give love because she is love.

710
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:50,204
She has to give all the services.

711
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:52,246
She has to give all the possessions,

712
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:55,701
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

713
00:48:55,821 --> 00:48:57,776
what a responsibility!

714
00:48:58,657 --> 00:49:01,874
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

715
00:49:02,044 --> 00:49:03,774
is the responsibility of a woman,

716
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:07,102
and she should feel proud of it,
 that such a responsibility has come to me.

717
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,205
A housewife

718
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:12,872
 has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:18,101
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

720
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:21,827
because they think they have become leaders.

721
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:23,544
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

722
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:27,253
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

723
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:33,276
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

724
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:37,836
 I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

725
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,241
and each one of them adores Me.

726
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:48,189
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

727
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,620
all of them will come from all over to see  me

728
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,821
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him. 
He always complains.

729
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:58,916
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
 and they come and see me, not him!

730
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,637
If I had not given them love,

731
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:06,188
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

732
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:08,502
they would have not come to Me.

733
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:14,079
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

734
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:17,281
 They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

735
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,715
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

736
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,480
many stupid women.

737
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:28,331
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

738
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:33,464
Because they don't know what power they have got.

739
00:50:36,948 --> 00:50:40,154
They don't know what responsibility they have.

740
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:44,158
 I'm an example before them.

741
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:52,057
 And this is the very big problem with me that practically

742
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:55,543
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

743
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:58,166
I must say, horrible.

744
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,235
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

745
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:06,183
They can't live in an ashram,

746
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,441
they will have their food,
 the husband must see that they have their food.

747
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,388
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

748
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:16,160
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

749
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:23,224
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

750
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,297
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

751
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:30,472
But No, they sit down,

752
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:33,409
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

753
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,793
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

754
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,788
Just do that! Do this!"

755
00:51:43,216 --> 00:51:45,564
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

756
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:50,346
Every wife of a leader

757
00:51:50,595 --> 00:51:55,491
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

758
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,053
They have to cook. And with heart.

759
00:52:03,525 --> 00:52:07,619
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

760
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,649
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

761
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:16,079
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

762
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:19,372
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

763
00:52:19,682 --> 00:52:22,756
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

764
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:25,084
encourage their niceness.

765
00:52:25,386 --> 00:52:27,842
 Also I have seen, some very good ladies

766
00:52:27,914 --> 00:52:30,796
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,157
After marriage they are lost.

768
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:35,426
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

769
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:41,449
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
 otherwise they are not there.

770
00:52:42,428 --> 00:52:46,272
Today I was asking Arnaud,
 he told me so many of them are like that here.

771
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,000
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

772
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:53,725
because before marriage they were better off.

773
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,882
 So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

774
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:02,181
for us to be together,

775
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:05,634
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

776
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:08,382
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

777
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:12,523
 So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

778
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,340
the Ragas we have.

779
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,385
Ra is energy.

780
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:21,025
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

781
00:53:21,184 --> 00:53:22,525
'which moves into everything',

782
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:26,750
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

783
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,581
etheric...... into which you see

784
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,621
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

785
00:53:33,431 --> 00:53:37,878
 So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

786
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,843
and touches your spirit.

787
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:45,179
That is the Raga.

788
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:51,281
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

789
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,385
Supposing if you stand with a military band

790
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:04,065
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

791
00:54:05,903 --> 00:54:10,000
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

792
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:15,060
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

793
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:19,914
 The way the housewife decorates the house.

794
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,506
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

795
00:54:24,717 --> 00:54:26,662
Then she's looking after everyone.

796
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:28,861
 Everybody knows she is standing there.

797
00:54:29,029 --> 00:54:33,143
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

798
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:36,964
some people for birthday cake of your child

799
00:54:37,218 --> 00:54:39,293
and you cut the cake first

800
00:54:40,238 --> 00:54:42,185
because you are the housewife.

801
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:46,649
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

802
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:50,861
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

803
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:54,404
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

804
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,420
Look after all of them,

805
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:04,299
and this is what is a Raga is.

806
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:08,970
It caters to all your angularities.

807
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:12,195
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

808
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,952
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

809
00:55:15,742 --> 00:55:17,368
It soothes you down.

810
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:21,341
It makes you settle down.

811
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:27,283
Like people come home for five days, live like

812
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,206
 I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

813
00:55:30,471 --> 00:55:33,417
and live in a tent-like thing

814
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:36,666
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

815
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:39,304
or they go and stay in a hotel.

816
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:41,950
Nobody wants to stay in the house

817
00:55:42,522 --> 00:55:45,747
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

818
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:52,104
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

819
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:55,416
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

820
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:59,205
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

821
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:03,219
So, one has to settle down

822
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:09,042
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

823
00:56:09,321 --> 00:56:10,942
who is a housewife,

824
00:56:11,245 --> 00:56:14,810
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

825
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:19,187
 As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

826
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,269
in the modern times, much more,

827
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:26,257
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

828
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,641
Is that the wife...

829
00:56:29,391 --> 00:56:32,480
normally in India before, you see,

830
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,848
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

831
00:56:35,078 --> 00:56:37,200
all the time his wife is not with him.

832
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:40,337
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

833
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:44,615
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

834
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,864
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

835
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:49,874
then they have a divorce.

836
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:53,492
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

837
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,952
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

838
00:56:56,447 --> 00:57:00,020
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

839
00:57:00,689 --> 00:57:03,009
sits on the ground, in India.

840
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,742
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

841
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:08,767
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

842
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:13,232
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

843
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,602
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

844
00:57:16,722 --> 00:57:19,390
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

845
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:22,694
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

846
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,000
That's why in India

847
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,207
 if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

848
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,361
 his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

849
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,398
That is how, they show their temper.

850
00:57:36,652 --> 00:57:39,604
 So then she fans the husband slowly

851
00:57:39,806 --> 00:57:43,458
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

852
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:47,748
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

853
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:51,308
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

854
00:57:51,573 --> 00:57:54,851
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

855
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,764
but you see all nice things, you see,

856
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:04,029
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

857
00:58:04,191 --> 00:58:06,260
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

858
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:07,992
And your sister is coming.

859
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,096
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

860
00:58:10,256 --> 00:58:12,272
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

861
00:58:12,518 --> 00:58:16,740
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

862
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,765
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

863
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:22,086
where there is a jam, always.

864
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:27,885
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

865
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:31,573
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

866
00:58:31,804 --> 00:58:34,076
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

867
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:36,713
that on the periphery of the

868
00:58:38,002 --> 00:58:40,115
wheel you have the speed

869
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:45,033
but at the axis it is not. 
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

870
00:58:45,781 --> 00:58:50,156
and so the husband and the wife,
 the left and the right side of a chariot

871
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,660
have to be on the axis

872
00:58:52,883 --> 00:58:55,718
and the left is left and the right is right.

873
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,913
 Now the women always take more time to get ready.

874
00:58:59,064 --> 00:59:01,399
Not me, I take less than My husband,

875
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,331
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

876
00:59:06,874 --> 00:59:10,439
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

877
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:13,887
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

878
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:16,270
Men must see their watches ten times.

879
00:59:16,694 --> 00:59:21,275
Women might see it once or may be 
their watches are lost or out of order -

880
00:59:21,498 --> 00:59:23,097
if they are real women.

881
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:26,567
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

882
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:30,231
But they are women and you are men,

883
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:33,336
and God has made men and women.

884
00:59:33,585 --> 00:59:35,483
If it was to make a unisex,

885
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:38,126
He would have made unisex, He did not.

886
00:59:39,499 --> 00:59:42,811
 So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

887
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:47,705
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

888
00:59:48,136 --> 00:59:50,645
And you must know this is Woman's party!

889
00:59:50,993 --> 00:59:54,042
 In India we have this thing like, you know,

890
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:57,301
I was married in a family,

891
00:59:57,388 --> 01:00:00,399
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

892
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:03,329
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

893
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:07,483
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

894
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:09,766
my friend come and see Me.

895
01:00:10,245 --> 01:00:16,039
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

896
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:19,584
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

897
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:23,263
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

898
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:25,560
See how beautiful it was,

899
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:31,677
how beautiful it was,

900
01:00:33,999 --> 01:00:36,485
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

901
01:00:36,597 --> 01:00:40,249
because after all that was the system of that family, 
alright, its alright.

902
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:46,915
 But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

903
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,037
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

904
01:00:51,334 --> 01:00:54,138
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

905
01:00:54,456 --> 01:00:58,767
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

906
01:00:59,686 --> 01:01:03,399
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

907
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,801
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

908
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:15,136
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

909
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:18,910
That person is the most sensitive,

910
01:01:19,403 --> 01:01:21,127
is the most intelligent.

911
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,533
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

912
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,919
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

913
01:01:28,078 --> 01:01:29,668
so, is better leave it to the book,

914
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,940
and today let us have the puja

915
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,638
May God Bless You.

916
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:35,450
 Any questions?

917
01:01:41,142 --> 01:01:43,801
This means, I'll be spending some money?

918
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:48,259
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

919
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:51,068
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

920
01:01:51,188 --> 01:01:52,822
 That's why the money is for.

921
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:54,674
Must give to others, you see.

922
01:01:54,737 --> 01:01:56,793
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

923
01:01:56,845 --> 01:01:58,737
Just enjoy giving others.

924
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:02,423
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
