1
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:04,252
I don’t mind to tell you about what’s
happening

2
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:13,827
in the other lokas, which we don’t see,
of which we are not aware.

3
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:21,270
It may frighten you a little bit. But
the time has come for us to know,

4
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:27,680
how are we placed in relation to the whole?

5
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:35,783
What are the plans of the Divine? And how
are we going to fulfil them?

6
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:43,910
Now most of you are here realized souls.

7
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:49,693
Some of you have come first time; you will
also get your realization.

8
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:53,644
But the common point is that you are all
seekers -

9
00:01:53,845 --> 00:02:01,749
seekers of God, seekers of peace, seekers
of love. That’s a common point.

10
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:10,753
But this seeking has come to you not
for your own sake,

11
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,150
for an individual ascent

12
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:22,619
or for some achievements of a place from
where there is no return,

13
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,700
but this is the last judgment that all
the human beings have to face.

14
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:37,803
They have to go through it and to achieve
their last,

15
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:42,599
achieve their places in the kingdom of God.

16
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:49,278
Today you are sitting before Me; you have
been with Me before and much before.

17
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:57,404
But today especially when you are with Me,
you have come here to face up to it

18
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:02,106
and to see for yourself that you are able
to bear the truth,

19
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:06,402
the love, the blessings of God.

20
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:12,920
That you can enter into the Kingdom of God
and abide there in His reign

21
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:17,775
with all His powers flowing through you.

22
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:24,146
It has been promised before. All promises
are to be fulfilled.

23
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:31,083
All scriptures are to be supported and are
to be proved.

24
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:41,534
But we must know that there is a great war
going on

25
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:45,720
between satanic forces and Divine forces

26
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:54,424
and all the satanic forces who symbolized
as devils –

27
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:59,268
in Sanskrit language they are called as
rakshasas, asuras and all that,

28
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,659
have taken their birth on this Earth

29
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:12,635
to demolish the kingdom of God, imagine.
What ambitions!

30
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:17,831
But they want to demolish this kingdom
of God in your hearts.

31
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:22,725
The kingdom of God exists, will exist,
it’s eternal.

32
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:25,064
It has created Universes after Universes.

33
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,653
aIt has created human beings from amoeba
to this stage. It has brought you

34
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:37,260
to this position that today you are here
to receive your ultimate goal.

35
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:48,345
It all has happened now. At this critical
moment,

36
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:54,506
at this precious moment when you are about
to enter into the kingdom of God,

37
00:04:54,707 --> 00:05:00,197
all these forces are built up to pull you
down.

38
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:07,018
It lies in your wisdom to understand that
the forces are very subtle,

39
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:12,922
extremely cunning beyond your
comprehension.

40
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:18,840
Even after entering into self-realized
state you have noticed,

41
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:26,290
how they act on you, try to drag you down,
pull you down.

42
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,360
This war is played not on the conscious
plane as it was played before.

43
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:37,339
Say one rakshasa coming in was all right
to kill him,

44
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,204
he came as a rakshasa, he came as a devil,
he was killed, finished.

45
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:46,311
But today they have come as Godly men,
as God men – as they call them,

46
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:50,867
as God women. They call themselves as gods,
gurus.

47
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:55,151
They have come in the garb of religion.

48
00:05:55,762 --> 00:06:00,226
These ancient rakshasas have taken their
births

49
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,883
and they have gone into the minds
of the people.

50
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,120
Thousands and thousands of seekers they
have captured.

51
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:13,475
Imagine the situation is so, so precarious
and so dangerous.

52
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:17,584
They have entered into the minds
of the people who are the seekers,

53
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,029
who are the ones who are to be bestowed
with this kingdom,

54
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:30,796
who are to be enthroned, who are to be
crowned,

55
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:41,863
have been destroyed, tortured by these
horrible forces.

56
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:49,089
And because it is not in your conscious
plane, you cannot see them,

57
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,600
you cannot feel them you cannot understand
them, how dangerous they are.

58
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,881
While they have learnt all the methods
of coming into your

59
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:02,707
ego or into your superego – to influence
you.

60
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,580
That war we all have to fight.

61
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:15,669
If we have to establish ourselves fully
in the kingdom of God, we must know

62
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,599
that we have to fight all those pulling
forces.

63
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:26,815
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless
people,

64
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:32,832
is not meant for people who have no
courage, is not meant for cowards.

65
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,934
It’s not meant for people who run after
money

66
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,344
and who run after all these material
things –

67
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:43,082
especially the first people who are
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

68
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:51,465
They have to be people of great caliber and
of great desire to achieve

69
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:57,932
their state of emancipation

70
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:06,834
because they are the people who are going
to save the whole humanity.

71
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:09,412
They are the redeemers.

72
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:16,789
They are the one who are going to manifest
the salvation of this doomed humanity.

73
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:24,880
Those who are weak can be strengthened
because the energy lies within them.

74
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:29,264
Those who are unhealthy can be cured.

75
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,259
Those who are mentally disturbed can be
brought round.

76
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,018
But there is no place for cowards in this.

77
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:45,221
You have to be courageous and cheerful
people. For one thing

78
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:50,515
because you represent that force which is
fighting for the Divine,

79
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:55,235
for God Almighty, you are His hands.

80
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,697
And you have to be wise also. Stupid people
are no good.

81
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:14,675
Stupidity can never help you to rise. You
have to be wise people.

82
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,582
Useless people, those who run after
nonsensical things,

83
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:25,895
let them go wherever they like. They’ll
come back

84
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:30,210
when their time and turn will come.

85
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:35,208
We need not be many people for this,

86
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:46,302
very few can save the world but they have
to be strong

87
00:09:46,905 --> 00:09:51,529
and absolutely established in their
understanding of the Powers

88
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:59,251
of their Spirit, powers of their Father who
is Almighty.

89
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:05,823
Don’t worry what happened to you before
getting realization.

90
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:11,374
Those who ponder over these things will not
achieve much.

91
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:14,004
Past is past, is finished. Now today you
are facing Me

92
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:19,010
and I am facing you. This is the present.

93
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:29,659
It is not possible for Me to give you the
complete vision of the great war that is on

94
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,126
and how you are to be saved.

95
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:42,894
The tempest I feel, in a boat, I have put
in My children in.

96
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:47,949
Try to keep in the center to keep
the gravity all right.

97
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:55,810
And when you’ll get strong enough, you will
row the boat with Me.

98
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:01,275
Do not hate yourself. Do not torture
yourself and don’t feel guilty

99
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:03,726
by which you become very, very weak.

100
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:07,271
What is there to feel guilty? I don’t
understand.

101
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:13,379
Imagine a warrior and a soldier feeling
guilty and the time when the war is on.

102
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:20,593
You have to be full of enthusiasm and full
of valor.

103
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:28,099
All these small, petty things, which
destroy your Spirit, throw them away.

104
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,343
No place for all these fashionable things
of feeling guilty.

105
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:36,217
This is the weakness of the West.

106
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:42,854
If you have to progress fast and if you
want

107
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:46,445
all this to be achieved, time is very
short,

108
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:50,805
you have to realize there is no time for
hanky- pankies as you call it.

109
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:55,533
But there is no time also for going round
the places.

110
00:11:55,734 --> 00:12:01,569
You have to settle down now. You have
to get to it.

111
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,006
So many realized souls are born today
as children in all the communities.

112
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:11,820
Even in Russia – can you imagine? Russians
are going to come to Sahaja Yoga.

113
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:16,532
I have been there. They may be the first

114
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:19,740
because they have reasoned out all
the nonsense of the so-called religious

115
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:28,863
and the religiosities and all the nonsense
of the false people who preach religion.

116
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:32,596
There is no place for false gurus
in Russia, no place.

117
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:37,065
Also for real gurus there is no place.

118
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:41,279
So you have to get, enter there through
their children

119
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,887
and children will recognize Sahaja Yoga.

120
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:52,524
Within ten years’ time everything has
to spark.

121
00:12:53,937 --> 00:13:00,824
It does not matter how you do it but you
have to do it.

122
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:06,414
For Me and for the Divine you are the most
important thing.

123
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:17,259
Doesn’t matter if there is an earthquake
and few horrible buildings fall down.

124
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:20,945
It makes no difference to the Divine.

125
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:26,711
What is important is how many are aware?
How many are progressing?

126
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:30,480
How many are settling down?

127
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:37,805
Those who are very frightened type have
no place in Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:44,379
That means you are still playing into
the hands of these negative forces.

129
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:49,354
Imagine frightened people coming as
soldiers for Sahaja Yoga?

130
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,555
I mean...

131
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,630
All the powers that are within you will
start manifesting when you show your valor.

132
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:06,551
When you are not even willing to raise your
hand, how your sword is going to work?

133
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:16,411
In India, now there are thousands and
thousands of Sahaja yogis.

134
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:19,555
And they are progressing fast.

135
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:22,382
You have to see now in the West,

136
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:27,890
how are we going to progress and how are we
going to settle down?

137
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:31,268
It takes time in the West, no doubt
to settle down.

138
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,179
Though realization is much quicker.

139
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,219
Indians get, as I always say that they are
difficult nuts to be cracked.

140
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,767
Even British are like that compared
to other Europeans.

141
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,759
But those who get realization also go down
very fast, sometimes.

142
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,273
But British once they get it, they get it
all right in their nuts.

143
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:57,181
They are good. There’s something about
their tradition maybe.

144
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:02,066
But still don’t take too much time to get
your realization.

145
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,792
Why should you get too much time to get
your realization?

146
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,994
You just desire it, it should work.

147
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:12,802
It’s only your desire that is going
to awaken it.

148
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:16,168
Desire it from your heart, not outwardly.

149
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:20,960
It’s a fashion nowadays to be a seeker. No!
It is an urge!

150
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:28,328
You cannot live without it. You have
to find it out. You try anything else.

151
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,738
People are committing suicide because they
have not been able

152
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,220
to find out their own meanings.

153
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:41,754
And that’s why it is very important that
you must take Sahaja Yoga,

154
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:48,505
not just like a shopping centre, as like
guru shopping, but very seriously

155
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:56,269
because your meaning is there to be
found out,

156
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:04,445
but your purpose and then the manifestation
of your purpose, that has to happen.

157
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:11,104
Sahaja Yoga started working in three
phases, in the West I think.

158
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:16,764
First – that people got their realization

159
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:22,563
to see that there’s wrong with them. Where
they have got something wrong?

160
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:28,633
The attention was taken inside by which
they could see that they have problems.

161
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:31,559
If you do not feel your problems and
somebody says that you have problems,

162
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,022
you’ll hit that person, very badly.

163
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:39,017
It’s better that you see for yourself that
there is a problem.

164
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:41,758
Once you see that problem within yourself

165
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,190
you will be anxious to see that you get
rid of it.

166
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,926
But if you do not see a problem you think
that you are doing very great jobs

167
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:55,416
and you are very great and you are
perfectly all right.

168
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:58,934
Or else if you see also some of the defects
because some people write

169
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,960
that this is wrong, that is wrong, then you
become guilty.

170
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,604
Both ways is wrong because one way you go
towards ego,

171
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:11,927
the other way you go towards superego.

172
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:18,069
So through awakening you start seeing
yourself

173
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,349
which side you lie? What’s the problem?

174
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,267
You start judging yourself. The first
judgment starts by yourself.

175
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:29,562
"Mr. so and so, judge yourself.

176
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:33,693
Here you are the mirror, now see: this is
what it is".

177
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:37,203
So you judge yourself and you want to get
rid of it,

178
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:41,142
you don’t want it anymore within you.

179
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:45,656
Then the second trouble starts when you
start judging others.

180
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,236
First you judge others, you get frightened,
“Oh God!

181
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:54,693
Horrible vibrations, run away. We’ll get
caught up”.

182
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:59,260
Gradually you get immuned. “Ha! We’ve known
this type, we’ve known that type,

183
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:04,828
we’ve known that type, we’ve know that,
all these types we know.”

184
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:12,729
Then you do not condemn anyone but you love
and in that love you judge it.

185
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:18,613
Because you want others to get rid of their
problems, you help;

186
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:22,994
you share their problems to begin with.

187
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:31,780
And the joy of giving realization starts
working in you, to others.

188
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:36,952
Now the problem starts when you look
around,

189
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:44,666
Western society I am talking about.
You find your society is in doldrums.

190
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:49,171
What’s the problem? Why the society is
in the doldrums?

191
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:51,661
What will happen? What basics have we lost?

192
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:57,195
What part of the sustenance of human beings
is lost? Why? Why?

193
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:01,969
So you find about your marriage
institutions,

194
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,710
about your relationship with each other.

195
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,499
That has to be settled. That has to give
you joy,

196
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,108
real joy of companionship and love.

197
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:17,387
And in the third phase the great who are
trying to be born

198
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:23,569
on this Earth, so many of them. They are
around here.

199
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,829
Just here, watching. They have to be born.

200
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:33,145
You have to be parents of those children.

201
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:38,092
They are going to blast all these satanic
forces

202
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:42,582
because they know what these satans are
like and how they are to be blasted.

203
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:47,669
They are experts. I have seen so many
of them and you have seen also.

204
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,048
They know what is Kundalini. They know how
to raise it

205
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:54,229
and they know how to blast all these
people.

206
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:07,343
And then the whole society of realized
souls

207
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:11,638
is going to pull out this humanity.

208
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,046
Every one need not be brought to Sahaja
Yoga; they’ll be all pulled out.

209
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:22,495
We must have sufficient pulling force
within us.

210
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:26,896
So those who come to Me earlier have
a greater responsibility

211
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:30,231
than those who’ll be coming much later say
after ten years.

212
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:37,800
They’ll be just jumping into it. You are
the ones who are going to do that.

213
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:42,364
So judge your self-esteem

214
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,197
and do not try to condemn yourself
for anything.

215
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:48,868
That’s forbidden in Sahaja Yoga, you know
that.

216
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:53,790
You are all saints. So many saints sitting
here imagine!

217
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:57,165
The Gods are singing.

218
00:20:58,141 --> 00:21:06,890
The Angels are showering all their joy
upon you.

219
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:14,924
What a meeting it is. What a force it is.

220
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:25,353
The auspiciousness of this meeting acts
not only in England,

221
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:32,162
not only in Europe, but in the whole
Universe.

222
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:36,625
But the channels have to be strong enough
to manifest it.

223
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:43,171
That’s why today I said, “I have to say
something really serious”.

224
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:52,094
On the 27th we are going to have a big
Puja, you know that (Guru Puja, 1980-07-27)

225
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:57,828
and I would like you to think about what
I have said today.

226
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:08,405
And I would like you also to proclaim
within yourself that you will establish

227
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:14,816
this Mahayoga on this Earth. That you will
bring

228
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:22,518
the blessings of this golden age on this
Earth, which was created for this.

229
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:26,301
The whole creation will find its own
meaning.

230
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:29,084
May God bless you.

231
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:43,528
I would request you to put your hands like
this towards Me - just like that.

232
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,913
Then the vibrations are so strong.

233
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:51,373
Like this there is not going to be any
difficulty in receiving realization.

234
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:58,514
Close your eyes. Put your feet straight on
the ground as far as possible. It's better.
