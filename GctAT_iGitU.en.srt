1
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,533
SY: ...know that we understand our meaning.

2
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,759
Is a tremendous seeking all over the world,

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,096
especially here in North America, so strong.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,342
And of course lots of people are taking advantage of that,

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,680
and exploited it for making money.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,120
The one thing that's obvious is that

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,040
none of the previous stages of our evolution

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,999
we had to do any effort or pay any money.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,273
It's just nature working out its process.

10
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:46,193
SM: Is it all right this way?

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,446
They can hear Me better like this?

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,321
All right?

13
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,308
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,947
The Truth that we are seeking

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,416
has to manifest in our consciousness.

16
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:44,888
It is not a mental projection.

17
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,585
It's not our imagination.

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,666
It has to express itself actually

19
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,107
on our central nervous system.

20
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:01,239
That is what the Truth is.

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,039
For example, you come to this room

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,879
and you see these things,

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,030
and you see them with your own eyes.

24
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:14,189
Through your central nervous system

25
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,945
you know what it is.

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,719
If you feel this is aluminium here,

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,582
you can feel it whether it is cold or hot.

28
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:31,359
On your central nervous system,

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,983
on your nerves, you have to feel the Truth.

30
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,829
But we live with mental projections.

31
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:45,120
All are mental projections I find.

32
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,492
We have conceptions about everything

33
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:53,959
which can be completely mythical,

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,483
absolutely wrong.

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,393
We have been building them up one by one;

36
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,422
like that we have built up,

37
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:08,606
so many different varieties of conceptions

38
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:13,487
and the people who represent one God and one Truth

39
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:18,115
are now fighting on the battlefront.

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,113
It's rather surprising for people to see how they talk of God,

41
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:30,560
they talk of love, they talk of all that is universal.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,449
Then why do they fight?

43
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,659
It's a big question today for your young people.

44
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:42,661
And that is the reason why they suddenly become

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,000
extremely against God, against His existence.

46
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:55,239
They cannot believe that there could be a God

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,879
manufactured by our mental projections

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,597
that has led them to this kind of warfare.

49
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,031
That is where we have gone wrong to understand

50
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:14,917
that mental projection is not the way to know God.

51
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,781
For example,

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,543
if I start thinking that, "All right, now I am in Houston."

53
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:30,759
I am facing people and I'm talking to them.

54
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,738
Do I do that?

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,853
I may not be able to even envisage or understand,

56
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:41,919
visualize the hall in which I am,

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,929
leave alone the people.

58
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,200
But in My own imagination if I start feeling,

59
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,439
"This is the Truth, this is the Truth",

60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,960
then even the falsehood can become the Truth.

61
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,960
And that is what has happened

62
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,583
to all those people who talked about God.

63
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:01,077
It's all their mental projection

64
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:04,076
which has led them to these problems.

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,840
Once Mahatma Gandhi was asked by some Christians -

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,840
it can be asked about any religion,

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,960
it's not only the Christians who are doing that,

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,614
everyone is doing the same stuff  -

69
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:20,096
that, "Why don't you join? Why don't you become a Christian?"

70
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:23,735
He said, "All right, but tell me which church?"

71
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,359
And if you then

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,553
think about the people who want to unite the churches also,

73
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:33,641
what they are uniting is nothing but these mental projections.

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,241
And then where do you lie with that mental projection?

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,948
So, we have to understand

76
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:48,280
that in every scripture it has been said

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,839
that you are to be born again.

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,240
Now, when you say that you are to be born again -

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,038
in 1970 I came to your great country

80
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:01,559
and when I told them about this,

81
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,643
then they started a very big campaign, "We are born-again".

82
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:11,276
This is all self-certification.

83
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:14,840
What is the difference between a person who is born-again

84
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,325
and who has, who is not born-again?

85
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:22,280
You cannot, just by changing your dress or by changing your name

86
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,452
you can become a born-again.

87
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,719
Or even a pattern of life

88
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,200
which is based upon only a mental projection if you change

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,827
you are not a born-again person.

90
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,536
Born-again means -

91
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:39,799
in Sanskrit language a bird is called as "dvijaha",

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,467
meaning the twice-born.

93
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,159
Bird is called as "dvijaha"

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,325
and a realized soul is also called as "dvijaha",

95
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,341
means born-again.

96
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:55,840
So, a person who is reborn

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,168
has to be a completely a transformed personality -

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,003
like an egg becoming the bird.

99
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:11,416
What is the similarity between the egg and a bird? Nothing.

100
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,239
That kind of an actual transformation

101
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,599
is the Truth which one must ask for,

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,603
and should not go in for some sort of a plastic transformation,

103
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,516
which is very easy to do -

104
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:37,400
you wear one plate around your neck and this, and this.

105
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:40,799
Do you become that?

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,519
If you say, "I am a Christian", do you become a Christian?

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,422
If you go to a church - why I am, say, telling about Christianity?

108
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:50,587
Because that's the main religion here,

109
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:53,040
but same thing you can about Hindus;

110
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:57,117
you can say about every religion just the same.

111
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,759
So, somebody comes and puts water on your head

112
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,040
and says, "Now, I have given you the baptism."

113
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:08,160
But is that the real baptism?

114
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,560
What is the living process that has taken place

115
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,604
in a person who is baptized?

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,707
We must face it

117
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,559
and that facing is difficult

118
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,720
because we have built those mental projections

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,280
and we want to live with the mental projections,

120
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,106
and our ego does not allow us to see the point at all.

121
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:34,080
But who is the loser?

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,801
Not God. It's you.

123
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,372
You are the loser who want to live and satisfy yourself

124
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:45,197
with those mental projections.

125
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,848
Now, one has to go beyond the mental projection.

126
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,479
And how do you do?

127
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,718
How are you triggered out into that space

128
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:02,199
where you are beyond thoughts

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,879
and you are completely aware?

130
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,640
Something has to happen within ourselves,

131
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,026
a living thing, just like a ...

132
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,644
an egg becoming the bird.

133
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,584
In the many rituals that we do

134
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:26,728
there's the hand of the Unconscious that guides us.

135
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:31,919
For example, on an Easter Day we give an egg.

136
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:36,328
I think many people don't know why we give an Easter egg.

137
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,999
The reason is, that is suggestive,

138
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,400
that you are an egg and you have to become the bird,

139
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,479
because Christ, by His ascent has proved

140
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,503
that you can transform into that subtler dimension.

141
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:57,577
But it is an actualization of the whole happening.

142
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,999
It is not just some sort of a false understanding,

143
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,039
and this is what people don't want to get out of it.

144
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,759
The reason is it's very comfortable to belong to one clan.

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,120
Only thing, either it is a Friday for Muslims

146
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
or for Christian the Sunday,

147
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
or for Hindus the Tuesday,

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,479
one day at the most you have to get ready,

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,109
go to the church, temple or mosque as their case may be,

150
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,432
and then it is finished.

151
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,800
You have done all your duty towards your Creator

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,154
and that you have listened to some sort of a boring lecture,

153
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:37,880
and it's done. That's what it is.

154
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,329
That's what it amounts to be,

155
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,451
but it is not so.

156
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,239
Something has to happen within us

157
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,377
when they said that you have to be reborn.

158
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:55,051
How much human beings can live with myth?

159
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:57,079
Is the limit!

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,159
I mean, the way they live with mythical things and falsehood

161
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,453
is really, cannot be explained.

162
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:09,400
The way they go on with it, for ages now,

163
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,239
one generation, two generation, ten generations, twenty generations.

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,240
They are going on like this with that mythical idea,

165
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,625
and they are becoming worse and worse and worse,

166
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:24,623
full of fanaticism which is a disease.

167
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:28,213
So now, if you cannot hold your fork properly

168
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:30,120
and your knife properly,

169
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,319
you are out of the club.

170
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,278
It's like that, is that superficial.

171
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:38,376
The whole stuff is so superficial.

172
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:42,400
So, one has to come to a point to understand

173
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,328
that all this is not God at all.

174
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,583
It's just talk, talk, talk and talk.

175
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,960
People will have conferences,

176
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,639
they'll have big-big seminars,

177
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,034
and what will come out of it will be

178
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:59,822
what are we going to spend for the building fund.

179
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:04,461
Supposed to be for God's sake.

180
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,624
Like yesterday I told you

181
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:10,520
that when bishop of Canterbury,

182
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:14,520
archbishop of Canterbury, was asked - on a TV it was happening -

183
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:16,640
that, "What is Holy Ghost?"

184
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,239
He said, "I am very agnostic about it".

185
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,731
That means he doesn't believe in God, just imagine.

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,308
So, the interviewer asked, "Then how are you there?"

187
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:30,685
So he said, "I'm doing my job".

188
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,786
Then what job is he doing there?

189
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:35,855
I saw it with My own eyes, I would not have believed it.

190
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,159
But what is your job then?

191
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,640
If you do not believe and you cannot explain what is the Holy Ghost,

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,199
then how do you bless people?

193
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,179
That, "In the name of the Holy Ghost I want to bless."

194
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:53,968
But we accept it, closed-minded we accept it.

195
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,238
Because they say, "It's, it's, it's a mystery."

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,960
"It's a mystery". But it is not.

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,797
Use your logic a little bit.

198
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:06,030
It cannot be a mystery. Use your logic.

199
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,134
That's how you have missed the point

200
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,280
that you have not used your logic

201
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
but you have used your rationality

202
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:16,869
to build up all these yarns and get entangled into it.

203
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:20,719
Now, what is the Holy Ghost? Let's see that.

204
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,119
You have the Father

205
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,982
and you have the Son.

206
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,120
And you have the Holy Ghost, but not the Mother.

207
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:34,055
Now, can you tell Me of a father getting a son without a mother?

208
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,192
Simple common sense.

209
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,879
Absolutely a simple common sense.

210
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,520
My father who was a very learned man

211
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,438
and I should say in a way he was My guru

212
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,120
because he told Me about human beings, how absurd they are

213
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,919
and he explained to Me why they behave like this,

214
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,322
he told Me that they try to avoid the name of the Mother

215
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:08,926
because the Muslims may feel hesitant to join Christianity.

216
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:13,651
But Martin Luther himself was a realized soul

217
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:17,440
but poor thing, he must have been pressed by everyone,

218
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:20,128
"Oh, baba, don't say like this".

219
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:26,520
He could not think that it will go on forever.

220
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,016
He thought once Christianity is established,

221
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:32,696
people will be able to say about the Mother.

222
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,999
And this is what I am here to tell you

223
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,072
that it was the manifestation of the Father,

224
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:47,732
then of the Son, and then of the Holy Ghost - the Mother.

225
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,354
Surprisingly, only in India people accept that.

226
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:57,358
For them Holy Ghost is nobody else but they call Her as Adi Shakti.

227
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,280
And any incarnation they talk of,

228
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,759
first they take the name of the Shakti, the power, the Mother.

229
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,315
They will not take the name of the Father.

230
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:14,658
First the Mother, and then the Father.

231
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:18,555
Now, when we talk of the motherhood

232
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:22,784
we have to know that it is this motherhood

233
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:25,680
which is going to nourish.

234
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
It is this motherhood

235
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,263
which is going to soothe.

236
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,282
And this is the motherhood about which Christ has said,

237
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,273
"I will send you the Holy Ghost".

238
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,960
He didn't say, "I have finished, nobody is going to come."

239
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,255
He clearly said, "I will send you the Holy Ghost,

240
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:45,209
the Counselor, the Redeemer".

241
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,996
All these things, He has said it clearly.

242
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:53,578
But we do not want to see that.

243
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,500
We prefer Christ, because He's no more.

244
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:01,532
Because when He was there, we preferred Moses.

245
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:08,032
And when Moses came, we preferred Abraham

246
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,080
because it's very easy to handle the situation.

247
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:12,590
They are in your pocket.

248
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,338
Whenever you want you can take it, "Oh, that is Christ!"

249
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,685
All right, so it's selling in the market very well.

250
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,382
It's the market issue.

251
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,159
So, when Christ said

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,599
that, "I will send you the Holy Ghost,

253
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,959
and that Holy Ghost is going to comfort you,

254
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,400
redeem you, and council you",

255
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
what about looking forward to that?

256
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,280
Nobody bothered about it

257
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:44,840
because it was too much beyond the ego of people.

258
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,919
They just don't want to see that point.

259
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:51,759
Now, this motherhood

260
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,635
is represented here as the Kundalini, in the triangular bone,

261
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,679
which is the Mother.

262
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,159
It's called as the Kundalini because "kundala" means

263
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,679
the coils, it is coiled up.

264
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,452
And this is the Mother within you.

265
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:18,199
This is the Mother that is existing within you,

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,364
is there all the time, and She is the one

267
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:23,839
who is going to give you the re-birth.

268
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,199
She is the reflection of the primordial Holy Ghost.

269
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,673
And She is the one who is going to give you

270
00:17:32,874 --> 00:17:37,814
this second birth which is expected.

271
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,935
So far it has been as I told you,

272
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:45,920
the manifestation of the Father and of the Son.

273
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,027
And the tree of life

274
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:51,963
has grown outside too much.

275
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,641
The development, the science,

276
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:59,800
all these has created what? The monsters of bombs.

277
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,920
Nobody could stop it.

278
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:05,799
Why not?

279
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,040
Because they could only move on one side - outside.

280
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
They were moving outside

281
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,247
and they found the big tree grown

282
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,439
without growing to the source.

283
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,880
And now the time has come for you to go to the source

284
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:26,157
and that source is this one, is the Kundalini.

285
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,439
She is the subtle energy within us

286
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,383
which manifests outside

287
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,083
the motherly qualities in you.

288
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,839
Now, you may say that the man is the one

289
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,879
and the women are now having a feminist movement.

290
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,724
That's one of the expressions.

291
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,959
But the feminist movement

292
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,040
is not what I am talking about.

293
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,280
Is very mislead, is another kind of a religious, mental projection.

294
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,360
The feminist movement is

295
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,239
like a pendulum movement of your consciousness.

296
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,120
Like, a woman wants to become a man,

297
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,960
man has to become like a woman,

298
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,279
and the fight going on.

299
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,839
I'm not talking about a rebellion at all.

300
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,839
I'm talking of a revolution.

301
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,999
And the revolution has to take place where

302
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,399
you move spirally higher than what you are,

303
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,239
not in a pendulum from one to another end.

304
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,719
So this new consciousness of motherhood

305
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,359
has to manifest.

306
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,160
And when this new consciousness will manifest

307
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,800
you will see a man will be changed

308
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,680
into a compassionate, kind,

309
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,919
soothing and nourishing personality.

310
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,760
It is for woman as well as for man.

311
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,319
The whole, entire idea of competition, of domination,

312
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,254
of occupying others territory,

313
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:04,800
all these has gone too far of the manly qualities.

314
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,436
They have crossed all the limits.

315
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:10,360
Imagine, to come to some country, occupy it,

316
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,640
throw away all the people, kill them nicely,

317
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,710
is it a sign of a good person?

318
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:22,119
Is it good to do these things to anyone?

319
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,240
Somebody, somebody comes into your house

320
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:27,280
who is a very mighty person with a gun

321
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:30,559
and throws you out of your house, and settles down nicely.

322
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,807
What will you call him? A very nice person?

323
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,162
All these things have been  so far.

324
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,119
We have had enough of this.

325
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,699
Now, what do we want?

326
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,599
People, who are compassionate.

327
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Really compassionate,

328
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:49,123
not just talking of love and making money out of it.

329
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:55,399
But the one who can emit compassion, like Christ did.

330
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,760
What was Christ?

331
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,204
Did He compete with anyone?

332
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,692
He was nothing but compassion. It used to just flow from His being.

333
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:07,169
A lady touched Him and she got cured.

334
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,508
Such people we have to create who will emit compassion.

335
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,000
So all these centers as he said - is the Vishuddhi chakra

336
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,960
which is very important as he said

337
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:23,521
is a center represented in the universe -

338
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:26,520
your country, America, represents that.

339
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,960
Is a very important center,

340
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,239
is a completion, where the human beings raised their heads up,

341
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,009
is a very, very important center.

342
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:39,399
But where are they?

343
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,106
I don't think they find that responsibility within themselves.

344
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,079
Now, what is the responsibility?

345
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,592
Is that at that center you feel

346
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:01,210
that there is nobody who is the other.

347
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,440
That means you feel the collective consciousness. You actualize it.

348
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,519
It's not just a lecture, "You are all brothers and sisters."

349
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,174
It's again mental projection.

350
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,479
We say brothers and sisters. Even husband and wife,

351
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,359
any relationship,

352
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,720
it just breaks like that because it is mental projection.

353
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,637
But it becomes actualization within you

354
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:30,635
when you become collectively conscious. You become that.

355
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,742
That means you start feeling others within yourself.

356
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,640
You don't have to think that, "I am trying to do good work

357
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,640
or missionary work

358
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,017
and I am going to sort of  build some churches

359
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:53,959
or some sort of a place for the poor to come and live."

360
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,401
Who is the other?

361
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,719
You are doing for yourself.

362
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,584
It's just for yourself you are doing.

363
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,319
If I help this finger of Mine

364
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,602
am I doing any good to this finger

365
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:11,291
or am I obliging this finger?

366
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:14,239
Is there any obligation on this finger?

367
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,359
It's paining, I have to sooth it,

368
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,093
because it's part and parcel of Me.

369
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:22,479
Because it is part and parcel of Me,

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,815
how can it thank Me or how can I feel that I have obliged it?

371
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:30,127
How can I have ego about it?

372
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,680
Because it is just My part and parcel.

373
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,600
So what you have to become

374
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,386
is to become part and parcel of the whole.

375
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,399
As they say, "The microcosm has to become the macrocosm."

376
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,879
A drop has to become the ocean.

377
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,400
Has to become, again, I say, the becoming is the important part.

378
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,352
It's not the lecture. This you must have heard from many people,

379
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:58,689
"We all must become saintly". How?

380
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,879
Ask them. How do we become saintly?

381
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,959
By putting one red mark here can I become saintly?

382
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,720
Or by wearing some sort of a dress

383
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:12,128
which can be colored in three dollars,

384
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,422
can I become saintly?

385
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,199
Let's face it up.

386
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,840
There must be something happening within us

387
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,840
that makes us saintly despite ourselves.

388
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,919
We just become.

389
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,520
So that happening is the thing here

390
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,479
which is called as

391
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,479
the awakening within us.

392
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,120
Now this power is the power

393
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,599
of your pure desire,

394
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,634
true desire, pure desire.

395
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,359
All other desires are impure,

396
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,039
because they don't give you satisfaction,

397
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,879
they don't give you the ultimate.

398
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:58,359
Take any desire. Say, you want to have a house.

399
00:24:58,534 --> 00:24:59,999
All right, have it.

400
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,366
Then you want to have a car.

401
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:03,618
All right, have it.

402
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:06,719
Then you want to have an airplane, I don't know how it goes on.

403
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,840
That's why in economics it is said

404
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,106
that wants in general are not satiable.

405
00:25:11,307 --> 00:25:13,416
They are very honest, is... that's fact.

406
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:17,839
But there's one want within us which is satiable,

407
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,258
and that's the true want.

408
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,920
To become one with the Divine,

409
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,971
to become one with God,

410
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,160
to enter into the Kingdom of God

411
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,120
is the only true desire within us

412
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,679
and is sleeping in that triangular bone called as sacrum.

413
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,120
I would like to point out, the word sacrum means sacred,

414
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:48,079
that means Greek knew about it.

415
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,595
This is the Greek word and they called it sacrum.

416
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:54,039
Why don't we think why did they call it a sacrum?

417
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,120
They could have called it by any other name.

418
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,919
That means it is a sacred power of pure desire

419
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
that resides in it.

420
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,119
And this is what,

421
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,960
that is the reason in Sanskrit language it is called as Mooladhara.

422
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
Mooladhara means

423
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,679
is the support of the root. This is the root.

424
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,160
And this is the support of the root.

425
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,359
The center that is below this

426
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,559
is the center which manifests it,

427
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,039
is the center of our innocence.

428
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,080
When we were material beings

429
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,079
or when till we reached the carbon stage

430
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,584
we were having only this center within us.

431
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,228
And this center is the center of our innocence.

432
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,066
And the deity that rules the center

433
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:53,880
is the one who embodies innocence within us.

434
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,542
You can see it very clearly that the center of innocence

435
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,507
is below the Kundalini.

436
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,999
It is below the Kundalini.

437
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,476
That means the Kundalini doesn't pierce through this.

438
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:15,159
That means this center supports the Kundalini,

439
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,640
but the Kundalini rises above this center,

440
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,125
that means sex has nothing to do with your ascent.

441
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,009
That means you cannot achieve your ascent through sex.

442
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:32,864
This kind of a myth has been on and on in the West,

443
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:36,199
but in India nobody is going to believe such stories.

444
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,319
Because they are not so naive.

445
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,896
Here Mr. Freud - I don't know what to call him,

446
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
you may call him whatever name you like -

447
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:49,560
he is responsible for giving you AIDS.

448
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,415
Please, send him some letters of thanks.

449
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,759
He is the one who has given you.

450
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,868
And the way you accepted him, you denied Christ.

451
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,799
Christ had said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes".

452
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Not only the adulterous behaviour

453
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:14,720
but even the eyes should be innocent if you are a Christian.

454
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,425
Which church has achieved that, I would like to know.

455
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:23,255
That is what He asked for

456
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,719
that, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes".

457
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,399
That's only possible when the Kundalini

458
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,320
passes through that center of Christ and awakens Him,

459
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,200
your innocence is awakened in your eyes,

460
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,199
and you really have innocent eyes.

461
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,157
This is what has to happen.

462
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:47,959
But actually whatever has happened you know how far we have gone

463
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,400
with our ideas of licentiousness and permissiveness,

464
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,960
and our perversion,

465
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,320
thanks to mister Freud

466
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,283
who was the real guru of the western people to begin with.

467
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,759
There was only one person who was Jung,

468
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,999
who was a sensible man.

469
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,680
He talked of sensible things because he got his Realization,

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,239
but nobody has accepted them much.

471
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,306
In the whole of England we have only 12 Jungians.

472
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,159
And the other day I happened to meet about hundred of them

473
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,559
in New York.

474
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,477
And I was amazed at their quality of mind,

475
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:32,160
the way they understood the whole subject of Kundalini awakening,

476
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:34,000
and that the time has come

477
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,600
for this nourishment to work out within us.

478
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,694
I was amazed at their brilliance.

479
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:44,159
You have to have basically some intelligence to understand,

480
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,559
and not your ego which just repels you back all the time,

481
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,200
takes you away from the Truth.

482
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:51,960
But have your intelligence,

483
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,280
your pure intelligence to understand

484
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:57,200
that you have not achieved anything so far

485
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,985
so there has been some mistake, let's see what it is.

486
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:07,280
And they did, and they all got realized, you'll be amazed.

487
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:11,359
And the president of the organization who was the...

488
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,340
who was 82 years old, and who is a Jew, got up,

489
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:19,560
With such humility he said that, "Mother,

490
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,619
You know our language of psychology, which is a child science.

491
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,447
Now we have to learn Your language

492
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:30,520
which is the greatest of all."

493
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,543
Just imagine, for him to get up and say that.

494
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,635
But hardly you find people of that quality.

495
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:40,959
I thank Jung that he created at least hundred people in this country

496
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,135
who could understand what I am talking about.

497
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:52,355
Now, so we have within ourselves this center

498
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,519
which is responsible for our innocence,

499
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,960
and when we play about with it too much

500
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,959
we fall into traps of diseases.

501
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:04,491
It is very easy to understand for us

502
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:10,368
by our own natural instinct what is wrong and what is right.

503
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,148
But even if you avoid all your naturalness

504
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:17,759
with your all your artificiality and try all artificial methods

505
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,923
still you'll be amazed

506
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:24,238
that those people who lead this kind of life, have always suffered.

507
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:29,520
At every port, if you travel, there is a free clinic

508
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,759
for people who suffer from these dirty diseases.

509
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,607
It has been there since long, for all the sailors.

510
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,800
But the sailors don't understand

511
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,280
that we must be doing something very wrong

512
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:43,432
to get this kind of a disease.

513
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:47,836
Why do we suffer from such a disease? So that

514
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,239
we have done something wrong

515
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,040
or something we have gone against the nature.

516
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,919
When you go against the nature, you get diseases.

517
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,118
That's a simple thing, is to go against the nature

518
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,960
is the way you get diseases.

519
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,600
And you must understand your own nature,

520
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,306
and integrate with the nature outside -

521
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:11,759
you will never get a disease.

522
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,314
And when you get a disease,

523
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:17,933
understand that nature is punishing you and teaching you.

524
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:28,999
Secondly, this is the biggest achievement in Sahaja Yoga

525
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,484
that people who have suffered on account of their misdeeds

526
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:38,239
very much, in every way

527
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,999
have been cured.

528
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,560
Once the Kundalini rises, they get cured completely

529
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,999
of all these horrible diseases

530
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,960
which are hidden, which are always kept as secrets.

531
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,839
They can be easily cured if your Kundalini could be awakened.

532
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,839
But those who have problems in this center are the most difficult

533
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,841
because this center is the one which communicates

534
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,599
everything that happens within us.

535
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,479
The left-side line that you see here, the blue line,

536
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,239
is the one that collects all the information,

537
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,771
called as the Ida Nadi, which manifest outside

538
00:33:22,972 --> 00:33:25,799
the left sympathetic nervous system.

539
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,320
And it passes all that information to this center

540
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,079
and this center passes all the information

541
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,482
to the Kundalini which is like a tape in a tape recorder

542
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:43,079
and tapes all that you have done.

543
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,440
All the wrong and the good, the imbalances,

544
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,816
and all the nonsense you have done is recorded in this Kundalini.

545
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,159
Some people think no end of themselves, I've seen them.

546
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,239
But when I look at their Kundalini, I feel like crying.

547
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,917
The poor Kundalini is like a dead personality,

548
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:08,559
is like a dead snake trying to rise, trying to raise its head.

549
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,646
It's impossible for the poor Kundalini to rise

550
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:16,960
because you have neglected all that is noble, all that is kindness,

551
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,520
all that is righteous and auspicious.

552
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,999
We have forgotten the word sacred at all, completely.

553
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,800
We have forgotten the word sacred,

554
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,559
we have forgotten the word that is chastity,

555
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,468
as if it was something foolish to talk about these things.

556
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:39,919
Now, when people start suffering, you start reflecting back.

557
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,960
Now the new organizations have started I have seen

558
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,679
with a result of that,

559
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,200
that they think now you should lead a very chaste life,

560
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,995
one man, one woman and all that.

561
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:51,760
We have in India the same thing - one man, one woman

562
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,359
but have we solved the problem? We have not.

563
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,516
That's just a temporary thing

564
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:59,879
by which you cannot solve... At the most you may solve one center

565
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,359
but what about the other six centers?

566
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,159
What about them? They still exist to be solved.

567
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:12,160
And these six centers are very difficult in certain places

568
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,328
according to the way and style of life you have.

569
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:19,759
Now the second center that we have, actually,

570
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,760
is the center that comes out of the third center,

571
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,759
so you can change it, the number, doesn't matter.

572
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,715
This center is the center of our creativity

573
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,969
by which we go into action.

574
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,679
The activity.

575
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,439
The colour is that of the bile.

576
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,079
You see the bile colour existing.

577
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,839
When you are very active the bile starts acting,

578
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,759
and your liver becomes overactive.

579
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,960
When the liver is overactive you start feeling like vomiting,

580
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,199
and you always feel very bad,

581
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,440
and you feel there's something wrong here,

582
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:59,959
and all your attention is all the time in a very unhappy state.

583
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,199
This is because of your overactivity.

584
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,913
That's not the only thing that happens to you

585
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:08,240
with the overactivity of this center

586
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:13,199
because this subtle center does some more than that.

587
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,079
It has to look after other, other activities also,

588
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,559
that is of the spleen, and the pancreas, and the kidneys,

589
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,440
and the part of the intestines,

590
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,756
also you can say part of the uterus.

591
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:42,534
Now, when you start using this center too much

592
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:49,760
what happens to you that you start neglecting these centers.

593
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,294
Where do we use this center maximum?

594
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:55,960
When we think too much,

595
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,423
the Grey cells in the brain have to be replaced.

596
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,119
And who replaces them?

597
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,089
The centers from your stomach

598
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,547
which is this center which manifests the aortic plexus

599
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:18,320
converts or transforms the fat cells from the stomach

600
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,672
for the use of the grey cells.

601
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,927
And when you start thinking too much,

602
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:26,359
when you are futuristic, you are planning too much,

603
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,439
then the whole extreme behaviour puts you out of gear.

604
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,840
And that's how you start developing all these problems.

605
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,000
So, with the liver, you develop an active liver -

606
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,519
you cannot sleep, you feel like vomiting, you can't eat,

607
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,870
you grow very thin,

608
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,720
you can be very hot-tempered.

609
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,987
Such people can be very irritable. At the slightest thing -

610
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:52,760
and I see that in the car when they are moving -

611
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,879
slightest thing and they start honking.

612
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,800
They are very irritable,

613
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,080
they have no patience for anything,

614
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,245
they are very angry people,

615
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,014
hot-tempered, aggressive.

616
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:10,599
All other these things suffer, so you get diabetes.

617
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,608
If you are not very hot-tempered

618
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:14,694
if you don't know how to give vent to it

619
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,479
then you get diabetes,

620
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,486
you develop diabetic temperament with this right-sidedness.

621
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:24,489
Those who are overactive people mostly get diabetes.

622
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,862
The reason is they cannot show their temper.

623
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:30,080
If they are in the business, they have to be very sweet with everyone

624
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:32,319
and there's a temper burning inside.

625
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,999
They have to be extremely, say,

626
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,470
good and very gentlemanly, otherwise they'll lose the money.

627
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:43,839
So the temper is inside, all boiling up.

628
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,360
Here you have to be very nice.

629
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:48,006
At the back you may say all kinds of abuses.

630
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:51,336
But outside you have to be extremely sweet.

631
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:55,718
And that time, what to do? You get this horrible diabetes

632
00:38:55,919 --> 00:39:00,890
because your pancreas gets out of order.

633
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,720
Then the third thing that happens which is a very,
very serious thing,

634
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,599
which is very serious, very common in your country

635
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,559
is leukemia.

636
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:13,759
And that takes place as a result

637
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,239
of a very hectic spleen.

638
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,930
Spleen in you is the speedometer.

639
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:26,123
And when a person - say, for example, our modern life is such:

640
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:30,760
we sleep, I mean we drink first of all, nicely spoil our liver,

641
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,599
see to it that it is completely spoiled.

642
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,199
Then we take some drugs to sleep.

643
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,519
Then we cannot get up in the morning

644
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,079
because there are hangovers, naturally.

645
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,081
So we get up about the time when the birds are about to retire;

646
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:48,919
say about nine o'clock or so.

647
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,087
Then we somehow get into our clothes if possible

648
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,032
and rush to the car,

649
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,406
start driving, the wife brings the food,

650
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:03,188
one, somethings like a sandwich or whatever it is,

651
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:05,519
putting that in the mouth you are driving.

652
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,159
There's a jam on the road, so we are cursing everyone.

653
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,973
And here we are eating food, we are cursing people,

654
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:13,680
we are thinking about the office,

655
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:16,199
all kinds of emergencies at the same time.

656
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,560
At one emergency only

657
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,011
this poor spleen has to work so hard

658
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,905
to produce the blood cells.

659
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,799
And when you put so many emergencies on that

660
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,510
you can imagine, the poor spleen, what can happen to it.

661
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:35,720
It just goes... It doesn't know what to do, it becomes crazy.

662
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,328
You are crazy and the spleen is crazy.

663
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:41,400
And the parents who are like that

664
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,414
give their trouble to their children,

665
00:40:44,615 --> 00:40:47,120
because they make their children very funny too:

666
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:49,446
"You must sit here, you must eat like this."

667
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,879
"This is carpet is spoiled. Now, better clean it".

668
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,319
The carpet is more important than the child.

669
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,046
If the carpet is not cleaned out then the parents

670
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:59,174
will beat the child, do all kinds of things,

671
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,629
always make the child so tensed

672
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:07,252
that the child feels all the time edged up.

673
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:10,015
He doesn't know what to do, you see, all the time

674
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:12,485
the poor spleen of a child is this thing.

675
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:15,520
Even when the child is not born,

676
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,599
the pregnant mother -

677
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,040
mothers are so upset all the time.

678
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,119
With what are you upset?

679
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,720
"Oh, you know, this,

680
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,880
the milkman came, and this happened, and that happened,

681
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,360
the telephone came at the same time and

682
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:34,263
here it is, I had to receive somebody and there's a bill..."

683
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,680
All these modern things just make the women crazy,

684
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,439
worse than the men sometimes

685
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,519
because they can't bear it.

686
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,320
And then, at that time, the child gets the problem

687
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,756
and that's how they are born with leukemia.

688
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,796
Just imagine,

689
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:56,423
it is such a simple thing to lead a life of simplicity.

690
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,799
You need not be that complicated.

691
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,999
What is the need to be that complicated, I don't understand.

692
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,333
All these complications we human beings have made, isn't it?

693
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,079
Like, now I'm wearing a sari

694
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,006
then I must have a matching blouse, I must have a matching shoe,

695
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:19,591
I must have a matching purse, I must have My matching hair,

696
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,739
matching eyebrows, matching everything

697
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,149
If it is not matching, then I'm nervous.

698
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:31,880
All these stupid norms we have created,

699
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,203
just to make ourselves miserable for nothing at all.

700
00:42:35,404 --> 00:42:38,003
So the young people decided, "Oh, get out of it,

701
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:42,559
this is all nonsense, so let's have anti-culture."

702
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,199
That's another extreme.

703
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,477
Take drugs. Imagine,

704
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:50,496
to compensate for this madness, take to another madness.

705
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,159
Like one boy came to see Me

706
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,109
and he was all smelling, you see,

707
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,159
had all lices in the head,

708
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,852
with hair like that,

709
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:02,359
son of a very rich man, I knew about.

710
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,665
Horrible, you see, could not make him sit in the drawing room,

711
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:08,879
[as he was] smelling like a dirty pig, I tell you.

712
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,680
And I asked him, "My child",

713
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,080
- because I knew the father very well, a very well-off man,

714
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:15,376
he's a managing director of a very big shipping company.

715
00:43:15,577 --> 00:43:18,039
I said, "Why are you like this? What is the matter with you?

716
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,080
Why can't you be normal?"

717
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:23,639
He said, "I am trying to become primitive".

718
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,199
I said, "Why?"

719
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,199
"Because they are simple people".

720
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,079
But I said, "Your brain is not simple.

721
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,894
It is a modern brain. By growing hair like that

722
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:36,319
and putting lices in your head, you don't become primitive.

723
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,999
It is absolutely outside.

724
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,800
This is not the way you are going to be a simple person

725
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,560
by - you see, he was wearing pants with cuts in that and all that.

726
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,000
I said, "By this, how are you going to cut your brain

727
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,706
which is so modern, which is so complicated,

728
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:56,119
which is thinking all the time about the future.

729
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,248
This is all outside, don't you see this?

730
00:43:58,449 --> 00:43:59,960
And you have become so horrid

731
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,501
that you cannot meet normal people at all".

732
00:44:03,702 --> 00:44:05,903
So I made him going to the bathroom, have a bath,

733
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,202
I gave him a change and made him a proper person,

734
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:10,000
and then I gave him Realization.

735
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,840
Now he is a normal person,

736
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,760
given up all his drugs, everything.

737
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,960
He is a normal man, behaving all right.

738
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,978
But sometimes they come in a coma.

739
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:22,369
And still with that mental projection that they have become primitive

740
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,186
they said, "We are very happy. Let us die like this."

741
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,240
They are waiting for their doomsday. Most of them tell us,

742
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,189
"Oh, the doom has to come in any case.

743
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,960
That will solve all our problems."

744
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:40,320
Look at this. From this to that madness. I cannot understand.

745
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,640
Is a very common thing these days that, "The doomsday has to come

746
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,520
and we are all going to be solved."

747
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,840
You see, they are all going to be taken up like this

748
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,469
and put in the God's Kingdom because they have become primitive.

749
00:44:53,683 --> 00:44:54,879
This is the idea.

750
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,920
There are some who believe that if they are preaching,

751
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,399
if they are talking big about God, they will be there.

752
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,719
Christ has said very clearly,

753
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,883
"You will be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ!' and I will not know you".

754
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,999
Do we think about it? Why did He say so?

755
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,080
So, don't live in a mythical world.

756
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,759
Come to reality and face it,

757
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,159
that you are to be born again,

758
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,720
that Kundalini has to be awakened,

759
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,280
and that you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

760
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,560
out of your head and out of your hands.

761
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:33,205
This is the first time you feel the All-Pervading Power

762
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:35,679
as I told you yesterday.

763
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,759
Now I met all kinds.

764
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,282
So, there is one fellow very ego-oriented, came to Me.

765
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:44,440
He got Realization luckily somehow,

766
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,120
his ego, the balloon, went down and he got Realization.

767
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:49,620
I was amazed. How?

768
00:45:49,821 --> 00:45:52,200
The Divine is so anxious to give Realization

769
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:54,538
that this fellow came with such a big balloon

770
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:57,803
and how it has reduced. It reduced really I must say.

771
00:45:58,004 --> 00:46:01,236
He got Realization. But then it came back again.

772
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:04,759
Because it was just there for a while, again it came back.

773
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,788
So he says, "Mother, why You are the one who has to do it?"

774
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:11,280
I said, "My son, you do it. I'll be very happy.

775
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,378
Should I change My seat with you?

776
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:16,179
I'll be very happy if you come and do it yourself.

777
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,471
That's the best thing that you can do to Me is to do the job.

778
00:46:19,672 --> 00:46:21,826
But only thing, you will have to awaken

779
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:25,280
the Kundalini of thousands of people at a time

780
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:28,319
which is like a mountain being lifted with a finger.

781
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,239
That's one only thing you have to do.

782
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,080
Secondly, you have to know all about it

783
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
and you have to tell people what it is,

784
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:38,159
all the complications, all the decoding and everything

785
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,800
and you have to have tremendous patience

786
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,119
with people who have this big balloon on their heads."

787
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,996
So then he sat down, he wouldn't accept it.

788
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:50,799
I said, "What I get out of it?

789
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,880
Why do you feel so hurt if it is Me?

790
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,241
I don't know, really, even to handle a camera,

791
00:46:56,442 --> 00:46:58,357
I don't know so many things that you know.

792
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:00,759
I don't  know how to drive. I never feel hurt.

793
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,599
I know only one little thing is how to raise Kundalini.

794
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,083
Why should you be so much hurt about it?"

795
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,239
This is the thing that crucified Christ.

796
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,199
The ego.

797
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,960
They crucified, not only crucified Him,

798
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,698
they gave poisons and they tortured.

799
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:21,878
Anybody who came with the Truth had to be tortured

800
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,998
because everybody had such an ego and a collective ego.

801
00:47:27,573 --> 00:47:30,280
Why blame the Romans and why Romans blamed them?

802
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,039
Even today I find so many sitting like that before Me.

803
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,172
The same style of people who have crucified Christ.

804
00:47:39,144 --> 00:47:42,555
So, this is the kind of people who are very ego-oriented,

805
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:44,880
and when this center works fast

806
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:48,929
the ego starts rising like a by-product as you see in the head,

807
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,194
that yellow stuff which is horrid.

808
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,879
But when you start seeing it, you see the joke

809
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,479
that "This is the one which makes us stupid,

810
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,239
this is the thing which has really made us idiotic,

811
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,599
otherwise we will be normal people".

812
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,453
And then you want to ran away.

813
00:48:08,654 --> 00:48:11,799
Like one gentleman came to Me, said, "Mother,

814
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I just want to know one thing, but if it is true, don't tell me."

815
00:48:15,201 --> 00:48:17,366
I said, "What is it?"

816
00:48:18,171 --> 00:48:19,573
I said, "What's the problem?"

817
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,960
He said, "Please, tell me if I was Napoleon in last life".

818
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:26,399
"If I was, don't tell me, because I'll really collapse".

819
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,879
He is, he is a Frenchman.

820
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,319
So, I said: "Why, what makes you think that you were Napoleon?"

821
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,445
"Because I am so ego-oriented,

822
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:38,159
and I can draw very well which he used to do.

823
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,240
So, was I Napoleon?"

824
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:43,959
I said, "Should I tell you? You were not". "Thank God", he said.

825
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,439
"Because I was thinking if I was Napoleon

826
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,079
what will I do in Sahaja Yoga? I just cannot become spontaneous

827
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,600
because this ego will be coming like Napoleon's ego every time".

828
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,800
And it's - nowadays once upon a time

829
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:58,080
Napoleon who was supposed to be a hero

830
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,920
today is regarded as a curse on people.

831
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:04,155
If you call somebody Napoleon, never call a Frenchman

832
00:49:04,356 --> 00:49:06,859
because you'll have a black eye, I can tell you this much.

833
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,119
Napoleon is the worst word for them. They don't like it.

834
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,831
So this is what has come out of all this ego-behaviour

835
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,293
that people don't like it.

836
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,054
What about Hitler? You talk about Hitler to a German,

837
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,319
he says, "Don't talk, that was a big mistake on our part."

838
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,008
What did Hitler do? The same thing, he pampered the ego of people,

839
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:28,319
he said, "You are a special race with a special nose."

840
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,441
So, God is going to measure your nose

841
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:32,559
and put you on a higher pedestal.

842
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,199
Just imagine.

843
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,759
Then why did God create all the rest of them?

844
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,190
This kind of mental projection

845
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,439
makes you feel higher,

846
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,399
sometimes lower,

847
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,160
all kinds of these mythical things are there.

848
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,331
God has created you in sweet beautiful varieties

849
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:54,159
because without variety there is no beauty.

850
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,800
Imagine all of you

851
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,823
looking like military bowls sitting down here. How will it look?

852
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:03,311
You have to be people of variety,

853
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:06,079
so God has created a beautiful variety.

854
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,559
Enjoy that!

855
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,959
Enjoy the integration of that variety.

856
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,680
That is what one has to really enjoy,

857
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:15,800
but I think it's only possible when you get your Realization.

858
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,529
Before that it's just talk, talk and talk.

859
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:22,479
So now we come to the third center -

860
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,152
I won't be able to cover all of them today, I'm sorry -

861
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:31,895
which is very important because it is the center of your seeking.

862
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:35,439
First, we seek as animals our food.

863
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,093
Even now, we behave like animals, no doubt.

864
00:50:38,294 --> 00:50:40,800
So, we seek food, the attention is only on food.

865
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:43,039
Anybody talks of food,

866
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,479
we want to turn our face to that.

867
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,199
So, the food is the first seeking we had.

868
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,760
The second seeking we had of shelter,

869
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,519
to have a proper shelter,

870
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,900
and that has gone beyond any human understanding.

871
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:02,164
I have seen people building houses

872
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:05,491
which look like nothing on earth, you know.

873
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:07,341
We just can't say this is a house,

874
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:11,326
I mean, it's some sort of a funny thing that they make -

875
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:14,360
call it a house - where you feel you are in a nightmare, you see,

876
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,880
the way it is built upside down, going like that and...

877
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,996
You don't know what sort of a place it is and where you are living.

878
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:24,120
And that has gone to such a limit, specially in America I find

879
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,931
that you have to enter into any bathroom

880
00:51:26,132 --> 00:51:28,532
first enquire how to open,

881
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:32,357
otherwise you'll have a problem. Such varieties.

882
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:34,960
Like into one bathroom who was a very reach man's

883
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,372
I placed My foot and I was drenched in water. I said, "What's that?

884
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:40,028
From where is it coming?"

885
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:45,080
So, this kind of an unnecessary mental exercise

886
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,680
to select even the handle of the car.

887
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:50,269
If the handle of the car you don't know, better don't get in

888
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,340
because something happens you can't get out

889
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:54,959
because you don't know how to open the car.

890
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,398
It's such a madness to go on worrying

891
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:01,440
about the varieties of little, little, little, little things.

892
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:04,853
You know what kind of a thing - like today I went for shopping

893
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:07,759
and there were some ladies who were trying to decide

894
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,760
what kind of a ladle they should have.

895
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,599
Hours they took to decide for a ladle.

896
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,040
Can you imagine? What difference does it make

897
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:18,400
of one ladle or the other ladle?

898
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,320
And tomorrow if they see somebody else having a more modern stuff,

899
00:52:23,521 --> 00:52:25,325
they'll again be back and to find out

900
00:52:25,524 --> 00:52:27,639
that more modern stuff to do it.

901
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,494
I mean to amount of decision taking we have gone is maddening.

902
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,960
Specially on a table, if you go,

903
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,920
I have seen people - because I have to attend so many parties -

904
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,320
I just can't understand,

905
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:44,050
half an hour they discuss what they are going to have today.

906
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:46,479
I mean everybody must have what they want

907
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,266
and very particular on that point.

908
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:51,479
When the food comes they see they have got the same thing or not.

909
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,534
What is so important? The whole joy of eating,

910
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:56,301
the whole joy of meeting,

911
00:52:56,525 --> 00:52:59,399
everything is lost in that nonsense of decision.

912
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,993
What does it matter whether you eat a pizza

913
00:53:02,194 --> 00:53:04,120
or you eat that, I don't understand.

914
00:53:04,321 --> 00:53:07,418
At the most you can have one thing for all of you and just enjoy it.

915
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,240
But on the contrary, so much time we waste on nonsensical things,

916
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:17,400
and when we do that we develop funny diseases within ourselves,

917
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,920
because we put our nerves to too much tension.

918
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,640
It is too much of a tension for us.

919
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,879
We build up our own tensions for everything.

920
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,960
I have ordered for this, you have got this.

921
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,839
I wanted this kind of a handle, I got this one.

922
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,599
That's how we go on building up tensions in our stomachs,

923
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,600
and then we talk of our tensions. We have tensions,

924
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:42,482
and we have this tension and that tension, and what is to be done?

925
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,137
And then we get people coming out in the market.

926
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,168
They want six thousand pounds to reduce your stomach tension.

927
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,959
How can they reduce? They cannot.

928
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,280
And you believe it, because they advertise very well.

929
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,181
They put up a big show, "We'll remove your tensions

930
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:05,840
and we are here for your tensions, and this and that."

931
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,760
And you just go there and attend to them,

932
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,079
and you think, "Oh, now we have removed our tension".

933
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,534
Mentally you feel like that but the tension is all there.

934
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:21,342
That's how we build up our stomach in a very funny way.

935
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:25,737
Our real seeking should not be in politics,

936
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,291
should not be in any social behaviour,

937
00:54:30,492 --> 00:54:34,649
but it should be only towards our ascent,

938
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,439
towards our Spirit.

939
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,680
That should be our seeking,

940
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,960
and when that stage comes in

941
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:45,304
then they are the people of a special category

942
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:47,522
which William Blake has described

943
00:54:47,723 --> 00:54:49,808
that the men of God,

944
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:53,680
means the people of this special category, will become prophets,

945
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,280
and they will have power to make others prophets.

946
00:54:56,481 --> 00:54:58,800
And that's the time, today we are here

947
00:54:59,001 --> 00:55:03,890
that those who are men of God will become prophets

948
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:07,119
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

949
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,236
That is the sign, that if you can make others prophet as you are

950
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:13,210
then you have achieved your goal

951
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,639
and that should be the real seeking.

952
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,319
Politics is a mad world, you know that.

953
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,399
It's a mad world. And is a mythical thing

954
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,239
because when we talk

955
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,759
of capitalism,

956
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,215
what is your capital?

957
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,239
These worldly things, these stones, these plastics?

958
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,298
What are your possessions?

959
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,710
You have one possession which you do not know - that is your Spirit.

960
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:47,737
The one who has known that possession is a real capitalist.

961
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:53,317
And once he becomes that capitalist he spreads it, automatically.

962
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:57,120
For example, Me, I am a very happily married woman,

963
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,137
extremely happily married woman

964
00:55:59,338 --> 00:56:03,039
with a very good husband, very well-placed in life

965
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,999
with very good children, grandchildren,

966
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,400
very good family life, everything there,

967
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,759
but I can't enjoy it,

968
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,199
because I have to give this.

969
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,239
So, I become a communist in that way, in the real sense of the word.

970
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,079
I am a real capitalist and a real communist.

971
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,759
I spend My own money,

972
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,239
go and meet people, talk to them, make them understand

973
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,280
and ask them to be their Spirits,

974
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,025
to be themselves, to be their own power.

975
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,040
For what? People don't understand.

976
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,479
The people who are with My husband,

977
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,520
their wives say, "What are you doing?"

978
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,639
"Oh, why are you wasting your time?"

979
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,760
They can't understand, "What is She up to?"

980
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:48,322
because they are busy with other things,

981
00:56:48,523 --> 00:56:50,630
joyless pursuits.

982
00:56:51,178 --> 00:56:53,805
But I am here, working for you,

983
00:56:54,006 --> 00:56:56,039
working for everyone,

984
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,395
just that you also enjoy what I am enjoying.

985
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:02,056
So politics is all nonsense,

986
00:57:02,257 --> 00:57:04,612
it has no meaning at all, you can see that clearly.

987
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:07,960
That's why no politics has been successful.

988
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:11,920
I've been to Russia, it's another gone case; I've been to America.

989
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:15,559
We do not know how to bear our freedom.

990
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,338
We don't know.

991
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:19,919
We don't know, we want to have freedom of

992
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,969
Abraham Lincoln said that, because he was a realized soul,

993
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,559
but he didn't know that all the others are not.

994
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,159
Once you have your freedom, you go to abandonment, violence,

995
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,362
you don't know how to be free.

996
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:36,080
That glory is not within us,

997
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:40,199
to be free you have to be a king, to be a free personality.

998
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,079
If you are not that than you go hither, thither, do this, do that.

999
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,342
All the time what you do is self-destruction.

1000
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:51,039
Morning till evening you are thinking how to destroy yourself.

1001
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,330
Ultimately, all those who are affluent

1002
00:57:55,531 --> 00:57:57,759
democratic countries

1003
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,719
if you meet their young people, if you ask them

1004
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,519
you'll be amazed

1005
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,199
that they are doing nothing but planning about their suicide,

1006
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,759
which is the most sophisticated way of committing suicide.

1007
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,839
Can you believe it? That's a fact.

1008
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,600
We had three girls from Sweden, very young girls -

1009
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:18,319
in Cambridge they came to see Me -

1010
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,840
and when they came to see Me and I felt their vibrations

1011
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,934
I was shocked, I said, "Oh God,

1012
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:25,360
they have vibrations just like a dead man is.

1013
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,182
Is numb, complete numb." I said, "What are you doing?"

1014
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,040
They said, "You know, we think we are worth nothing. It's useless".

1015
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,199
I said, "Why? You are rich people, you have so much money,

1016
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,559
you are very well off, you have a very organized country,

1017
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,650
and everything is fine.

1018
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,711
What, what's the matter with you?"

1019
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:48,592
They said: "Actually, we are all planning how to commit suicide".

1020
00:58:49,697 --> 00:58:52,359
This is where you go with your affluence,

1021
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,079
with your so-called achievements,

1022
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,693
that either you try to destroy yourself,

1023
00:58:57,894 --> 00:58:59,310
or try to commit suicide,

1024
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:02,640
or can have a collective destruction

1025
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,225
by your great achievements of science.

1026
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:11,617
Because we do not know what freedom is.

1027
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:15,059
We do not know how much God has worked out

1028
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,519
to create these beautiful human beings,

1029
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,141
how beautiful, fantastic we are within ourselves.

1030
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:23,800
Because we have no idea as to what we are,

1031
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:26,518
that's why we accept all these things,

1032
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:29,575
go on living with it and destroy ourselves.

1033
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:34,650
So the main seeking within us is the seeking for God,

1034
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:37,119
seeking for our evolution,

1035
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:43,359
seeking for our higher dimension of collective consciousness.

1036
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,523
And that is what we have to achieve.

1037
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:50,622
Without that this world cannot be saved, cannot be emancipated.

1038
00:59:50,823 --> 00:59:55,316
There's no other way out but the transformation of human beings.

1039
00:59:55,517 --> 00:59:59,079
It's only the transformation that is going to work it out,

1040
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,079
nothing else.

1041
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,409
The time is short, one has to get transformed.

1042
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,039
Only those who will be transformed will be saved,

1043
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,199
all the rest will be sorted out at the end of the era,

1044
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,828
when you will find

1045
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,472
someone

1046
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,879
extremely powerful, destructive will come on this earth

1047
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,053
and will destroy everything else.

1048
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:33,767
Because that is what according to that personality

1049
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:36,419
would be the end,

1050
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:41,110
that would be a deserving punishment.

1051
01:00:42,082 --> 01:00:44,239
So one has to get transformation.

1052
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,931
That is the time that is given to us -

1053
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:51,596
is called as Krita Yuga in Sanskrit language -

1054
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:54,739
means this is the time when the All-Pervading Power,

1055
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,284
the Brahma Shakti, is working it out.

1056
01:00:57,485 --> 01:00:58,919
Better get it out.

1057
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,719
This is the Blossom time,

1058
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,839
better get it transformation within yourself,

1059
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,563
establish yourself as transformed human beings.

1060
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:10,759
Don't get to your egos.

1061
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,799
Don't mislead others, don't mislead yourself.

1062
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,759
I tell you, intelligence itself is such a funny thing;

1063
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,079
it has a capacity to cheat itself.

1064
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,846
This is the worst thing of intelligence is

1065
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:28,216
that it can cheat itself.

1066
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:31,575
So, this living process has to work out within us

1067
01:01:31,776 --> 01:01:37,035
so that we achieve our seeking, our fulfillment, our absolute.

1068
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:41,276
And that is something that cannot be discussed,

1069
01:01:41,477 --> 01:01:43,182
talked about. It has to happen.

1070
01:01:43,383 --> 01:01:46,479
Supposing, you want to know it on your mental level,

1071
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,960
I can only take you up to a point

1072
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:55,389
and find for you some sort of a logical conclusion.

1073
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,546
But ascending is your own.

1074
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:00,514
I cannot guarantee that.

1075
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:02,519
If it works out, well and good;

1076
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,239
if it does not, I cannot say that I can do it,

1077
01:02:06,479 --> 01:02:08,189
nor can I say you can do it.

1078
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,280
But once it happens, of course,

1079
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,199
you can give it to others, and to others, and to others.

1080
01:02:14,347 --> 01:02:17,167
You can work it out also, the same way,

1081
01:02:17,368 --> 01:02:21,280
as one light which is enlightened can enlighten another light,

1082
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:23,876
and you can go on enlightening others.

1083
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:28,365
A gentleman in India, who was not a very educated man, a farmer,

1084
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:32,427
has given Realization to more than ten thousand people.

1085
01:02:32,628 --> 01:02:36,478
So you can imagine how one can be powerful.

1086
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:40,487
I wish he had come to America but he had to go back to India.

1087
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:42,599
He came all the way to England

1088
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,889
then he went round with Me to Europe where

1089
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,153
he explained to people things in such a way,

1090
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:54,919
that they were surprised, an uneducated man

1091
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,000
talking like such a great saint.

1092
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,278
They could not understand how can he talk like that.

1093
01:03:00,479 --> 01:03:02,119
I asked him, "How are you?"

1094
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,159
"Are you all right, are you comfortable?"

1095
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,505
He says one Marathi words he says,

1096
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:10,119
[Marathi].

1097
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,244
"Whatever is the Eternal, wherever it keeps you

1098
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:15,051
let the Eternal look after me."

1099
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:17,624
Means when you are worried about the eternal,

1100
01:03:17,825 --> 01:03:19,243
when you are in the eternal,

1101
01:03:19,444 --> 01:03:21,676
why are you worried about these transitory things?

1102
01:03:21,877 --> 01:03:24,372
And I was so happy to hear these words from him.

1103
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:27,662
But there's one thing I must say that

1104
01:03:27,863 --> 01:03:31,040
he was a fortunate man

1105
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:36,310
to be born in a country where they know about it;

1106
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,246
and more fortunate to be born in Maharashtra

1107
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,032
which is a country of saints

1108
01:03:42,233 --> 01:03:45,140
who have written beautiful things

1109
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,917
and that country which is not so materialistic.

1110
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:52,950
For them materialistic achievements is not the success.

1111
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:55,459
That's why people don't understand. They always ask,

1112
01:03:55,684 --> 01:03:57,719
"Then why people in India are poor?"

1113
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,599
I said, "Not at hearts".

1114
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,611
They are smiling, laughing, festive people.

1115
01:04:02,812 --> 01:04:05,486
If you go to even a poor man's house,

1116
01:04:05,687 --> 01:04:10,193
they will offer you a cup of milk. They have a large heart.

1117
01:04:10,394 --> 01:04:11,709
Why they are poor?

1118
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,145
The reasons are we were slaves for three hundred years.

1119
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,122
Can you think of slavery of three hundred years?

1120
01:04:20,328 --> 01:04:22,651
Who is responsible for that?

1121
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,839
Who made us poor?

1122
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,253
We would have been much richer than anyone of these countries.

1123
01:04:28,454 --> 01:04:30,146
We were, once upon a time,

1124
01:04:30,347 --> 01:04:33,012
the richest people in the whole world.

1125
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:38,119
There is a rich site called the richest site of the world in Iran,

1126
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,360
is a hall four times bigger than this,

1127
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:45,559
and the every, the door that opens into it is six feet wide.

1128
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,079
And when you go inside, what do you find?

1129
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:51,840
A gentleman called Muhammad Ghazni who invaded India,

1130
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,719
only about six hundred years back

1131
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,393
and carried all the gold and wealth of one temple.

1132
01:05:00,385 --> 01:05:02,920
And the whole place is filled with diamonds

1133
01:05:03,121 --> 01:05:06,039
as if like the peanuts are kept in baskets.

1134
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,159
And a complete huge big globe is made out of gold

1135
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,789
with all these diamonds and pearls and emeralds

1136
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:16,359
and such big, big emeralds you see there,

1137
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,697
all brought from our country.

1138
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:21,800
How can we be rich when we were so docile people?

1139
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,737
Everybody came and lynched us like this?

1140
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,421
And then they ask us, "Why are you poor?" Very nice.

1141
01:05:28,622 --> 01:05:30,157
You enter into somebody's house,

1142
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:32,769
take away all his money, take away everything,

1143
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,640
nicely rule him, don't allow him to grow at all

1144
01:05:35,841 --> 01:05:39,195
and then you come and ask him, "Why are you so poor?"

1145
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:41,536
Wonderful people.

1146
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,879
That's what it is.

1147
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,920
So that country has survived despite all these

1148
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,459
because of their faith in God,

1149
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:52,200
in the faith that one day they will ascend.

1150
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:55,149
In India - I'm not talking of the westernized Indians.

1151
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,598
They are hopeless people, they are absolutely uprooted.

1152
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:00,308
Don't think of them, they are absolutely useless.

1153
01:06:00,509 --> 01:06:02,479
They are not the ones who represent India.

1154
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,369
But the Indians, the real Indians,

1155
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,199
who live in the villages, who are simple people,

1156
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,160
for them one thing is the most important is Atma Sakshatkar -

1157
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,339
means "to get your Realization".

1158
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,810
That's the highest for them.

1159
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:22,079
Nothing more higher than that.

1160
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,199
Their attention is not materialistic.

1161
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,486
Even if a woman is dying, she'll not sell her chastity.

1162
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,112
That is the great country,

1163
01:06:33,313 --> 01:06:36,680
which people have not realized, have not understood.

1164
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:39,400
They have exploited us, completely exploited us.

1165
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,483
You have no idea to what extend they exploited us.

1166
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:45,440
And today they are asking, "Why are you poor

1167
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:47,815
despite the fact you believe in God?"

1168
01:06:48,016 --> 01:06:50,703
I mean we are existing because of that.

1169
01:06:50,904 --> 01:06:52,960
Just because of that we are existing,

1170
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,800
otherwise we would have finished for long time back,

1171
01:06:56,001 --> 01:06:58,320
the way we are invaded on and on and on.

1172
01:06:58,521 --> 01:07:00,880
While it is surprising in the history of India

1173
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,999
we have never invaded another country.

1174
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,459
Never. Can you imagine?

1175
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:09,760
This is what it is.

1176
01:07:09,978 --> 01:07:14,792
So, some people say, "Why should we learn from Indians?"

1177
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,757
Very wonderful.

1178
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,928
We have learned all your science, all your things from you,

1179
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:21,960
we should go on learning everything from you,

1180
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:24,685
even your dominating nature, everything we learn.

1181
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:29,094
And you don't want to learn even about God from us. Why?

1182
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:31,799
Was Christ born in England?

1183
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,679
Where was He born?

1184
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,079
He also came to India.

1185
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,479
So one should not develop such ideas

1186
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,336
that, "We are the one highest in religion,

1187
01:07:41,537 --> 01:07:44,239
highest in science, highest in everything."

1188
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,400
It is the East and the West has to combine.

1189
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,519
As I said the tree has grown too big.

1190
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,407
There has been movement also downward,

1191
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,159
and that downward movement was in India.

1192
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,989
Of course, now you have many thugs coming from India,

1193
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:03,999
because you like them.

1194
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,299
For the last sixty years all the thugs also came out of jail

1195
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,439
are nicely have add in the market.

1196
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,201
And you like them very much.

1197
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:14,479
You see, let one of the thugs come here

1198
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,920
you won't be able to see even the chairs.

1199
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,137
They'll be all crowding here if they are thugs.

1200
01:08:22,815 --> 01:08:25,360
For a real person you don't have here anyone.

1201
01:08:25,561 --> 01:08:28,703
When I came in 1970, they told Me very clearly,

1202
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,199
"Mother, You cannot impress these people.

1203
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,959
You must know how to pamper their ego by taking their money.

1204
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,119
If You don't take their money, they are not going to look at You."

1205
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,074
And I went away.

1206
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:43,919
They've advised Me that, "These people will not understand You

1207
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,335
unless and until You take money."

1208
01:08:47,573 --> 01:08:50,039
These are the Christian nations.

1209
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,459
How much did you pay to Christ?

1210
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:58,347
And He was sold for 30 rupees.

1211
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:00,999
This is what it is.

1212
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,319
A day will come when you'll be asked about many things.

1213
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,359
Only thing is that if you become the Spirit

1214
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,839
then you are in the Kingdom of God.

1215
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,373
You are there.

1216
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,599
Everybody can enter into it.

1217
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,120
It doesn't matter whatever country you come from.

1218
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:22,006
Whatever is your past just forget it now and have it.

1219
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,819
You, please, have your Realization,

1220
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,676
enter into the Kingdom of God.

1221
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:28,679
But you have to be humble,

1222
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,679
you have to be humble about it.

1223
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,039
You cannot purchase Me,

1224
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,921
you cannot organize Me.

1225
01:09:35,122 --> 01:09:38,879
It is you who has to organize yourself.

1226
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,084
And I hope it will work out.

1227
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:45,442
Definitely it has to work out in this country, very important,

1228
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:48,359
because as I told you this is the Vishuddhi chakra

1229
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,519
which is a very important center of the whole world.

1230
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,960
And if America cannot do it

1231
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,199
I don't  know what's going to happen.

1232
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,003
May God bless you all.

1233
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,639
Now if you have any questions, need not be aggressive with Me,

1234
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,039
you can ask Me some questions.

1235
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,280
Oh, you don't know, in one of the places I went

1236
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:13,720
a lady came with a big Bible to hit Me.

1237
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:16,120
And she was about to beat Me with the Bible.

1238
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,800
And they, they photographed that.

1239
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,880
I was just laughing. I didn't know what to do.

1240
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:22,000
You see, I just was roaring with laughter.

1241
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,840
And everybody got upset. Of course, she didn't hit Me, thank God.

1242
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,949
But if she could have hit Me, she could have hit Me, what can I do?

1243
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:31,257
She was in such a big temper. I don't know what made her so upset.

1244
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:34,182
And then I asked, "What are you?" She said, "I am twice born".

1245
01:10:34,383 --> 01:10:36,415
I said: "Must be".

1246
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,320
So now relax.

1247
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,840
I would like to have some questions, sensible questions.

1248
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,759
We shouldn't waste others' time.

1249
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,520
Lady: Could You tell me which...

1250
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,919
well, which would be the best way to wake up the Kundalini?

1251
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,839
SM: That I will do now. That part is Mine.

1252
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,439
The reason is, you see, when the light is not enlightened

1253
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,800
the one that is enlightened can enlighten the light, all right?

1254
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,759
That's a simple thing like that, absolutely simple.

1255
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,839
Or you can understand the seed -

1256
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,520
if you have to sprout the seed what do you do?

1257
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,519
You just put it in the Mother Earth,

1258
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,079
and the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it.

1259
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,199
It's as simple as that.

1260
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,320
So that I'll work out and then you will work out for others.

1261
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:38,906
All right? That's very simple. That's a very good question.

1262
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:40,643
Shows the earnestness.

1263
01:11:40,844 --> 01:11:44,454
Man: When the seed sprouts then you continue your spiritual growth

1264
01:11:44,655 --> 01:11:47,360
into higher realm of spirituality?

1265
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,170
SM: I beg your pardon.
SY: He's asking

1266
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:53,199
if once the seed has sprouted does the growth continue?

1267
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,440
SM: Yes, yes, that's true.

1268
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,280
First the sprouting takes place, awakening takes place,

1269
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,120
you become first thoughtlessly aware -

1270
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,320
I'll tell you all these status you go into -

1271
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,600
and then you become doubtlessly aware.

1272
01:12:05,801 --> 01:12:09,199
And with those you start manifesting your powers of love,

1273
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,960
and you grow into it very much

1274
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,360
till you become a tree, you become your own guru,

1275
01:12:14,561 --> 01:12:18,599
and others call you a guru then, a real guru.

1276
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,615
It's true.

1277
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,652
M: Mother, interacting with other people,

1278
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:41,242
there are along the path, of the spiritual path

1279
01:12:41,443 --> 01:12:45,358
and, in any type of environment...

1280
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:49,150
SM: What is he saying? Just... Gavin you have to...

1281
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:53,956
M: Ok. Interacting with other people in any type of environment,

1282
01:12:54,184 --> 01:12:59,466
such as work or such as [unclear], whatever,

1283
01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:05,161
and they are not born Spirit yet,

1284
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:07,888
your discussion with them

1285
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:10,701
got, you want to reveal something to them.

1286
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:12,999
How would you go about doing that?

1287
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,248
SM: What's he's saying?

1288
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:17,760
SY: How can you awaken the seeking in others who are not seeking?

1289
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,639
SM: No, no, no, that I can't do.

1290
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,800
If you are not seeking really I don't want to make you seek.

1291
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:25,880
This is impossible. That's an impossible situation.

1292
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:28,960
If you are a seeker then I can help you.

1293
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,758
If you are not a seeker then, please, save Me.

1294
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:36,503
I cannot make, you see, a stone into a tree, can I?

1295
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:38,359
That's it.

1296
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,984
So that's not possible.

1297
01:13:40,185 --> 01:13:43,339
If you are a seeker, if you are seeking something,

1298
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,074
then only it can work out.

1299
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:48,359
Otherwise, I have seen the frozen Kundalini of many people.

1300
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,520
Now supposing if Hitler says, "You give me Realization".

1301
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:54,145
Can I give him Realization?

1302
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:55,840
That's it.

1303
01:13:56,041 --> 01:14:00,222
But you are a seeker, out and out. Don't worry about yourself.

1304
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,840
L: Don't You think there are a lot of people who are seeking

1305
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:07,039
but they don't know what they're seeking?

1306
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:08,715
SM: Very much true.

1307
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,560
L: [How can we address them or how can You...]

1308
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,919
SM: I mean, you see, today we advertised in the newspaper.

1309
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,919
We spent lot of money on other things,

1310
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,760
and we had television in Los Angeles,

1311
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,525
and they were very much impressed

1312
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:27,782
because the lady who interviewed Me felt the vibrations.

1313
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:30,291
So now they want to have a nationwide thing,

1314
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,240
something might work out with that.

1315
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,680
But what... we have everything with us;

1316
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,120
even My photograph works out, you will be surprised.

1317
01:14:37,321 --> 01:14:40,319
Even if you have My photograph, you can work out with My photograph.

1318
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,599
But the trouble is how to get them here.

1319
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,280
L: Tricky.
SM: Very tricky, you know.

1320
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,559
You have to have horns

1321
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,808
and a band in front of you.

1322
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,639
You know, you have seen your election campaigns, I have seen them,

1323
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:01,080
and I've said, "Ah, how can you do that?"

1324
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,168
But one has to do all those things, you see,

1325
01:15:03,369 --> 01:15:06,252
people are used to this kind of a circus.

1326
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,713
Yes.

1327
01:15:10,914 --> 01:15:14,599
M: Yes. Is tomorrow's programme is something different from today's?

1328
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,040
SM: Yes, tomorrow I'll be speaking about other centers

1329
01:15:18,241 --> 01:15:20,240
and how one can cure,

1330
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,000
and then day after tomorrow

1331
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:25,678
I'll tell you after Realization what is to be done.

1332
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,000
Yesterday I talked about the general things,

1333
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:33,081
about the three, three nadis that we have got,

1334
01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:36,239
left and right and the center one.

1335
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,560
And today I'm talking about the centers

1336
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,119
and tomorrow about the rest of the centers,

1337
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,680
and after that I'll be telling you

1338
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:47,799
after Realization what is to be done.

1339
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,594
That's how I put it for Houston

1340
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:54,296
but in another places I'm speaking in a different way.

1341
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:57,418
That's how we decided for four days.

1342
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,295
First, let us see,

1343
01:16:00,496 --> 01:16:04,043
I mean is talking is different and getting is different.

1344
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,640
Like talking about food you don't eat it, isn't it?

1345
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:12,057
So, better have it.

1346
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:15,668
Now, it's a very simple thing,

1347
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:18,759
is first of all I have to request you to

1348
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:22,241
little bit take out your shoes,

1349
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,604
because shoes - nothing wrong with it but they little bit stand

1350
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:31,751
between you and the Mother Earth.

1351
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,083
As it is, there are nylons here and nylons there. Doesn't matter.

1352
01:16:57,081 --> 01:17:01,639
Now the first block you have, I must tell you,

1353
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,999
is that here,

1354
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,920
is the first one - here,

1355
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:09,119
and that comes from feeling guilty.

1356
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,920
If I have said anything that makes you feel guilty,

1357
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,036
please, forgive Me.

1358
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,520
You are not to feel guilty at all to begin with,

1359
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:21,809
that is the first condition - not to feel guilty.

1360
01:17:23,838 --> 01:17:26,960
Now tell yourself that you are not guilty at all.

1361
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,877
At this time, you are sitting here.

1362
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,259
This present time, you don't have to think about the past.

1363
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:43,511
Just tell yourself that "I'm not guilty at all, not at all guilty.

1364
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,120
Whatever I've said, it doesn't mean it implies to this moment.

1365
01:17:50,321 --> 01:17:53,038
It is for the past.

1366
01:17:57,585 --> 01:18:00,093
Still there.

1367
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,427
In the beginning it was too much.

1368
01:18:04,628 --> 01:18:07,415
I also could not speak with that because you are all within Me

1369
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,824
and this was all caught up. I didn't know what to say

1370
01:18:10,025 --> 01:18:11,744
but thank God it's released a little bit.

1371
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,011
Don't feel guilty about anything, first of all.

1372
01:18:25,924 --> 01:18:27,993
Now, you have to put your hands like this.

1373
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,514
As I told you yesterday

1374
01:18:29,715 --> 01:18:32,920
that these are the five centers of the sympathetic left side,

1375
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:36,410
and six and seven centers. So these are the seven centers,

1376
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:39,659
and there are seven centers on this. This is the right side,

1377
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,626
means the mental and the emotional, mental and the physical side,

1378
01:18:43,827 --> 01:18:45,449
and this is the emotional side.

1379
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:47,680
So now, these are the centers,

1380
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,319
and you have to place your hands just like this.

1381
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,259
Now, the left side is the power of your desire.

1382
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,879
So, put this left side towards Me.

1383
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,287
Not of pure desire,

1384
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,919
but of your desires.

1385
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,879
So, put the left hand towards Me like this,

1386
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,804
and the right hand also like this,

1387
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:12,040
and I will tell you how to use the right side;

1388
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,564
because the right side is the power of your action.

1389
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:17,319
Please, sit down, all of you

1390
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,359
with your both the feet on the Mother Earth, properly,

1391
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:26,572
with a little humble attitude towards it.

1392
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,187
Now,

1393
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,925
you have to close your eyes,

1394
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:47,040
and don't open your eyes till I tell you.

1395
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,119
You should not open your eyes at any cost.

1396
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,520
If you open your eyes, then the Kundalini won't rise

1397
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,880
because something has to happen within,

1398
01:19:56,081 --> 01:19:57,999
so keep your eyes shut.

1399
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,950
Comfortably, just keep your eyes shut.

1400
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,960
Now, please, do the things I tell you,

1401
01:20:10,161 --> 01:20:12,599
just put your left hand towards Me,

1402
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,479
and the right hand is now to be lifted to your heart.

1403
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,239
On the left-hand side is your heart.

1404
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,542
Put your right hand on your heart.

1405
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,639
You have to sit straight

1406
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,762
with your neck straight, not bending forward or backward.

1407
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,601
With a cheerful mood you have to sit down,

1408
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,720
and not with a laughing or a smiling one

1409
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:52,839
but a cheerfulness inside.

1410
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,965
Not with unhappy mood either.

1411
01:20:58,511 --> 01:21:03,607
Because this is you are going to achieve which

1412
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,599
has been your longing for ages now, and you are going to get it.

1413
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,499
So, look forward to that.

1414
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:16,159
On your heart now you ask a question

1415
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,039
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

1416
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,777
So you can address Me as Shri Mataji

1417
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:25,648
or as Mother, "Mother,

1418
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:30,471
am I the Spirit?" Ask thrice.

1419
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:34,400
Without feeling guilty, with full confidence.

1420
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:38,640
Put the left hand on your lap, parallel to the ground, yes.

1421
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,482
Now, ask a question.

1422
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:47,749
Left hand parallel does not mean upside down, but open hand,

1423
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,999
open hand, the palm is upward.

1424
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,729
Put the palm upward.

1425
01:21:54,752 --> 01:21:58,905
Now, ask a question, with full confidence.

1426
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,960
Now to know that you are the Spirit

1427
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:30,926
you have to know one more thing,

1428
01:22:31,127 --> 01:22:33,577
that the Spirit is your Master.

1429
01:22:33,778 --> 01:22:35,640
And once you become the Spirit

1430
01:22:35,841 --> 01:22:38,679
you become your own Master.

1431
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,319
So put your right hand on the left-hand side of your stomach,

1432
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,679
left-hand side of your stomach, in the center, and press it hard

1433
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:53,690
because that is the place resides the power of your mastery.

1434
01:22:54,192 --> 01:22:56,816
Now, ask a question:

1435
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,800
"Mother, am I my own Master?", "Am I my own Guru?".

1436
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,785
This you have to ask ten times

1437
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:11,485
because there are ten guru principles within us.

1438
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:11,942
Now again put the right hand on your heart.

1439
01:24:13,064 --> 01:24:15,479
Now, here, assert yourself

1440
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,400
and say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1441
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,960
Say it twelve times, with full assertion and assumption:

1442
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,334
"Mother, I am the Spirit".

1443
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,759
Now, put this right hand on your shoulder

1444
01:25:46,946 --> 01:25:50,119
near your neck, on the left-hand side,

1445
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,840
on your shoulder, near neck.

1446
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:55,043
This is the place, where I showed you,

1447
01:25:55,244 --> 01:25:57,759
that people, when they feel guilty, there's a catch.

1448
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,247
Press it hard. You'll find it's quite a hard place.

1449
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,418
Here you have to say: "Mother, I am not guilty".

1450
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:10,239
Say it with full confidence sixteen times.

1451
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,179
And if you have that habit, better say thirty two times.

1452
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,305
Sixteen times, please say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

1453
01:26:23,506 --> 01:26:26,445
You have to forgive yourself.

1454
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,959
You have to forgive yourself

1455
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,880
by saying, "Mother I am not guilty at all, I'm not guilty".

1456
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,960
Put it next to your neck.

1457
01:26:55,832 --> 01:26:58,919
Now, put the right hand

1458
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,502
on the forehead.

1459
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,039
And at this point - across, put it across -

1460
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,532
and now say,

1461
01:27:11,656 --> 01:27:15,109
"Mother, I forgive everyone".

1462
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,039
After forgiving yourself,

1463
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:21,370
you have to say, "I forgive everyone".

1464
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,749
Across, put your hand across.

1465
01:27:33,703 --> 01:27:37,313
Across, not with your finger but across.

1466
01:27:41,705 --> 01:27:45,359
From your heart you have to say that, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

1467
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,969
You'll feel very much relieved, you just try it.

1468
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,331
Half of your tension will drop away.

1469
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,600
Now, put this hand at the back of your head and hold it tight.

1470
01:27:59,415 --> 01:28:01,399
Hold it tight.

1471
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,537
Now without feeling guilty, without thinking about the past

1472
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,176
in a general way, you have to say

1473
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:11,152
that, "Oh Lord, oh God,

1474
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,505
if I have done any mistake, please, forgive me".

1475
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,599
Without feeling guilty, that's very important.

1476
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,576
On the back of your head, on the back of your head.

1477
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,815
At the back of your head,

1478
01:28:34,016 --> 01:28:37,029
not on the neck but on the back,

1479
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,732
over the optic lobe, we can say.

1480
01:28:54,407 --> 01:28:57,067
Now put your hand on top of your head,

1481
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,679
in the center of it,

1482
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,680
and press it with your palm,

1483
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,880
and try to move it clockwise.

1484
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,667
Move it clockwise.

1485
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,520
At this point as I said I cannot cross your freedom.

1486
01:29:22,726 --> 01:29:24,991
Keep it in a comfortable way.

1487
01:29:25,599 --> 01:29:27,648
Comfortable way. From the front if you put it,

1488
01:29:27,815 --> 01:29:29,599
it will be comfortable.

1489
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,719
And move it a little bit.

1490
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,589
And now, at this point, as I cannot cross your freedom

1491
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:40,283
you have to say: "Mother, please give me my Realization".

1492
01:29:42,236 --> 01:29:44,800
Because I cannot do it without your permission.

1493
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,199
"I want my Realization. Please, give me Realization".

1494
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,870
Just ask for it.

1495
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,255
Seven times.

1496
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,879
Now put your hand down

1497
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,679
and with your left hand,

1498
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:30,519
feel if there's a cool breeze coming,

1499
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,362
on top of your head.

1500
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:45,742
Raise it higher to see

1501
01:30:45,943 --> 01:30:49,699
not very high, but at a higher point. Because close to your head

1502
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,719
you might feel the heat coming out of your head.

1503
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,605
So little higher, not much, about six inches.

1504
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,236
See now, if there's cool breeze coming.

1505
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:13,253
Don't think about it. If you think about it, it will stop.

1506
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,346
Now change your hand if you want.

1507
01:31:16,547 --> 01:31:18,439
Again see with your right hand.

1508
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,000
Just see, if there is a cool breeze coming here.

1509
01:31:51,944 --> 01:31:55,071
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

1510
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,280
Now I'll teach you how to raise your own Kundalini.

1511
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:05,858
You can open your eyes.

1512
01:32:06,059 --> 01:32:09,200
Now do it without thinking, try to see Me without thinking.

1513
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:11,360
You have to do it. Don't think about it.

1514
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,680
It's just an action of your hand because it is awakened now.

1515
01:32:14,881 --> 01:32:16,299
So we have to establish it.

1516
01:32:16,339 --> 01:32:19,399
Just put this left hand in front - by sitting only -

1517
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,117
in front of your Kundalini, like this.

1518
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,618
Like this.

1519
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,439
Can you see? Just like this, while you're sitting. Left hand.

1520
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,160
Now, with the right hand you have to move it like this,

1521
01:32:32,361 --> 01:32:34,635
forward, downward, backward, upward.

1522
01:32:34,836 --> 01:32:36,360
Like that, you see? Like this.

1523
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:40,159
Now, let us start. We have to go up.

1524
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,159
Take it up, through your head up and

1525
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,325
twist it now and give it a knot.

1526
01:32:53,547 --> 01:32:55,380
Again, let's try.

1527
01:32:55,581 --> 01:32:57,360
Once more.
