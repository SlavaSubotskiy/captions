1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:08,829
So, the time has come to say farewell to all
of you. I must say this time our Tour has

2
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,870
been really very successful. There have been
no obstructions no problems nothing, except

3
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,870
for one stupid article, we had no problem
and which they are going to look after. On

4
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,960
the whole, we have learnt a lot this time
and I think everybody has been feeling very

5
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,030
much better because of Shivratri Puja. I’ve
got reports from other countries that they

6
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,370
said Mother: ‘What did You do this time
on Shivratri that we all felt so much higher

7
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,210
and better’.

8
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,210
Now the, few things I have to tell you that,
luckily you have a very good National leader

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:08,310
here, who has brought you all round very wise
person, and he is a very gentle as well as

10
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,610
very sensible person, and who has done, such
a good work that really I must say it’s

11
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,160
very remarkable, and now I have decided to
separate his work with National. See we Indians

12
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:51,910
feel very hot anywhere. We have too much of
sun within us I think. So, there, one has

13
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,180
to be thankful for that, that you have such
a nice leader here. Now I have to tell all

14
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,660
the people specially from Melbourne, that
you should not take things into your hands,

15
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:24,660
and start another sort of an organization,
arbitrarily doing something under some lady

16
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,879
like that Trish. If you have any problems
you can always write to Me I’ve told so

17
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,980
many times, but Australians don’t write
to Me is My main complaint about them. And

18
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,650
they should not start anything. I’m surprised
that there are so many Indian girls in Melbourne

19
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,370
and they also did not understand that they
have to write to Me.

20
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,370
So, once you are caught up you get lost, you
get vibrations in a very funny way so much

21
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,500
so that I can’t even really treat them in
this short time. So there is a list of people.

22
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,690
Can you bring the list? I’ve made the list
now, please write it down. Is there anybody

23
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,690
from Melbourne here? Yes. Go and tell them,
that you have to get all these people every

24
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:24,859
day, to sit down, Sunday morning maybe, and
see what sort of vibrations you have. You

25
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:31,969
can see it on the candle, there’s not to
go anywhere, just on the candle you can understand,

26
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:45,009
what’s wrong with you, and, you are getting
caught up. I’m surprised that you are supposed

27
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:53,159
to be Sahaja Yogi how could you not feel the
vibrations of this woman Trish. It took Me

28
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,569
not even a second to know that she is a bhoot.

29
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,339
But there’s a fraternity I think, that’s
why such nice Sahaj Yogis beautiful Sahaj

30
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:09,460
Yogis, got involved into it. So this is a
very serious thing and I hope this doesn’t

31
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,939
happen next time. Now the list is like this.
I made the list. Can somebody read it for

32
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:20,939
Me. Please, take it. It’s a serious thing,
otherwise you’ll be lost, I’m telling

33
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,830
you.

34
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,139
Leader: Michael Davies, Jackie Hodge, Peter
Hodge,

35
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,210
Shri Mataji: Go slowly.

36
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,819
Leader: Mother shall we give them a photocopy
of this?

37
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:45,669
Shri Mataji: Still you read it.

38
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:52,669
Leader: John Poulianakis, Fred Millar, Ian
Lowry, Greg Bradshaw, Lyndon DeValle, Philip

39
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:07,869
Noone, Martin Purcell, Colin Berry, Jeff Platford,
Bruno Archello, Glen Pulolovich, Ben Flora,

40
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:34,610
Savita Noone, Cheryl Bradshaw and Helen Platford.

41
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:44,330
Shri Mataji: They are all first class Sahaj
Yogis I tell you, all of them. And it’s

42
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:52,050
really beyond Me, even when he’s reading
the thing I’m getting on the left, you just

43
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,039
see, you’ll feel it, terrible. Getting the
pain here. Now how are they going to be all

44
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,569
right? I’m worried about them.

45
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:07,569
Now also in Melbourne, I thought I’m sending
a very very good sensible leader. But I don’t

46
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:15,619
know why people, got after him, and formed
a group outside. If I am sending somebody,

47
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:24,949
I should know that I know what I am doing.
So you become anti Me or what? So please all

48
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:39,379
those people, who have got, these problems,
work it out every night, every morning on

49
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,960
the three candle treatment, and you can go
in the garden, sit down there, also say Ganesha’s

50
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,469
mantras. It will take some time for you to
be all right, I can tell you. Even taking

51
00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:02,469
their names you get left swadisthana, aren’t
you getting left swadisthana, the whole left.

52
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:12,399
This can happen to anyone, because somebody
like that comes up and starts her own. Anything

53
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:19,740
without the leader should not be done. They
went to such a limit, that they have taken

54
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,360
out the name out of the list of telephone
of these people, can you imagine. This is

55
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,289
too arbitrary, it’s very dangerous. It should
not happen anymore. People are very good at

56
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:49,230
combining together when it is some sort of
a, negativity. You see if you want to hate

57
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,040
someone, immediately, fundamentalists will
join together to hate someone.

58
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Now for Adelaide I would say, Adelaide has
one problem also people are very arbitrary,

59
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,120
they have given Me lots of trouble before,
and if they want Me to come back, now I have

60
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,820
asked Michael Sweet, because he’s quite
good at organizing, to organize all the people

61
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:28,450
in Adelaide. And please support him. Now don’t
get after his life now. That shows that the

62
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,690
leaders who are unscrupulous, who are dishonest,
are more appreciated and, can dominate people,

63
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,800
while those who are good nice people, are
to be dominated. So please in Adelaide, unless

64
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,720
and until you have an Ashram I’m not going
to come there. Get an Ashram, all of you shift

65
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,750
to the Ashram and work it out. If twenty-five
people Sahaj Yogis cannot live together, how

66
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,440
do I expect the whole world to be there? Just
think of our vision.

67
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,110
Then Wollongong, another thing, the other
day we had very nice people, I don’t know

68
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:30,110
how Sahaj Yogis are working out Wollongong.
They have to have, a proper Ashram, no individual

69
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:39,350
houses. Same in Newcastle. You all can have
a big house. Now these are the best days when

70
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:48,450
you can take a house on rent. It’s such
a God sent thing now for us, that you can

71
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,230
really get a house for a such a cheap price.
Take a big house outside, outside the city

72
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:05,660
somewhere, not in the city, and sit down with
your meditation. I hope you must have realized,

73
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:14,270
that a very great work, we are doing in Sahaj
Yoga, the greatest of greatest, and you are

74
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:23,130
all part and parcel, of that work. So please
try, to find out methods by which you all

75
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,970
could be closer, and understanding each other,
loving each other. Also beware of Indian girls,

76
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,310
in this respect, they have a tendency, that’s
what everybody’s informing, that they always

77
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,280
want to separate out and Indian boys also.
Otherwise they are all right.

78
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:53,280
But one of the reasons I know now why it is,
that you see the girls, or the boys, from

79
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,720
the west have led a different type of a life
a very different culture, and we can say it’s

80
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,720
not Sahaj, and they try to tell them, what
kind of a life they have led, and that makes,

81
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,440
them very miserable and they develop a nausea
with that. Then they are frightened. We don’t

82
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,970
have to discuss these things with anyone,
past is past is finished why do you want to

83
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:28,970
talk of that, filth now? So, nobody has to
discuss about the filth through which they

84
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,540
have come out. Do you mean to say that when
the lotuses come out, do they talk, or do

85
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,360
they smell of the filth out of which they
have come out. No. They spread fragrance.

86
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,170
In the same way now you are lotuses, try to
assume your powers. Even if you put somebody

87
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,780
on the throne and make him king, still he
is in a beggarish way. Everybody comes, he

88
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:07,740
says; ‘Give me one dollar.’ Then what
to say? It’s the same situation. Now you

89
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,310
are out of it, finished now, so don’t discuss
these dirty things and filthy things, that’s

90
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,910
why these Indians are frightened. Because
there is a cultural difference, and they want

91
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,910
to run away. So if you don’t talk about
it, they’ll be all right. Don’t discuss.

92
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,440
It’s filthy it’s dirty why to discuss
it?

93
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I’ve told hundred times when you are getting
married, not to talk about your past. There’s

94
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,240
no confession and all that in Sahaja Yoga,
you know very well, and people write to Me

95
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,820
and you’ll be surprised twelve pages fourteen
pages, of their confessions. ‘I’m trying

96
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:57,260
I’m trying’. I don’t read even one word
out of it because immediately I know the filth

97
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,720
is there. Burn it off. So no use writing to
Me also, I don’t want to know. Finished.

98
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,810
I don’t know what is the need for you to
write all these things. There’s no need

99
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:14,810
to write. All right? After all you are My
children, how you are born, is important than

100
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:23,340
from where you came is not important. You
are all beautiful people. I’ve already told

101
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,670
you what you are. Believe Me, you can check
out whatever I’ve said is true or not. Also

102
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,840
I’ve told you as I work without taking any
money, you too work without taking any money

103
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:41,840
don’t you? So please don’t discuss these
things. It’s not worth discussing talking,

104
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,920
filth. If some outsider starts tell them now
we don’t want to talk about. It’s finished

105
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,800
now, it’s gone.

106
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,800
That’s how things are working out now properly.
You see I depend on you very much for one

107
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,570
reason that you are from Ganesha’s country.
If you just know how to forget it, it can

108
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,890
be worked out. You are Shri Ganeshas in the
sense, that you are now innocent. Innocence

109
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,050
is born within you, there’s a fragrance
of innocence. Why do you want to remember

110
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,810
those dirty things. Now I’m telling you
again, if I hear from anyone, that anyone

111
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,330
is discussing this, then we’ll ask them
to get out of Sahaja Yoga. Because why do

112
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,330
they want to remember the filth? Again go
back to the same filth then. All right? This

113
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:47,370
is not to be done again, please.

114
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,370
So now we’ll come to another point of schooling
the children. I find that, still people are

115
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,410
very money oriented, as far as the school
is concerned. Very money oriented. Very. Now

116
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:12,050
for Indian schools we have calculated, how
much money will be needed and we have to also,

117
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,480
spend some money for equipping that to equip,
that school. Nobody is eating money there,

118
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,589
for heaven’s sake. As soon as it comes to
Indians immediately we’ll say, he eats money.

119
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:34,540
And when so many have eaten money in schools
here, Australians, nobody even thought they

120
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:41,540
will eat money. So, try to understand, is
much less the price that you are paying here,

121
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,640
even for preschool. While, not only it’s
education, but also food, also other amenities

122
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,640
they have to travel and this. There is some
little profit if they get will be good idea

123
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,330
so that we can equip them.

124
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:04,029
Now we have to build a high school. Who is
going to pay for the building? Is school for

125
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:11,029
your children, not for Indian children. Who
is going to pay? So that is it. We have to

126
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,079
have for, even for middle school that is after
the sixth of seventh that, what you call this

127
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:33,330
sixth class you call it or fifth class, we
have to have computer. They have to learn

128
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:40,330
about computer. Indian schools are not like
this. They have to have a science laboratory.

129
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,220
If you see the subjects they have to learn
you’ll be amazed. English they have to know

130
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:56,220
grammar very well, they must have proper spellings,
proper handwritings. This is the minimum,

131
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:04,809
I’m saying the minimum of minimum. My grandson
was studying in a school, it’s a very well

132
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,399
know school [INDIAN NAME] School and they
were paying much more there it’s a very

133
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,529
famous… We have private schools which we
call them as public schools and they’re

134
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:24,529
all, somewhere away from the cities. He was
paying much more. But when he joined another

135
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:32,340
school in Delhi, which is a day scholar, he
had to pay seventy-five thousand rupees only

136
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:40,470
to enrol himself, and every month he is paying
ten thousand rupees when he is just a day

137
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,049
scholar, in Delhi.

138
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:53,049
And this school is going to be much better,
much more equipped, various things we’ll

139
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,720
be doing. But every time I find such a money
orientation about schools. Same about preschool

140
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:08,580
I’ve seen it. See we must understand that
children are to be educated by us. The first

141
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:19,110
thing is you should never doubt the teachers,
no way. You must respect. This is what is

142
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:26,440
lacking in your education here. That’s why
children have no respect for anyone.

143
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,440
I told you the story, again I’ll tell you
the same story. That my father, had a, generous

144
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:41,220
habits of educating boys from poor classes.
That all we do, if we have money we just don’t

145
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:50,070
put it for ourselves and indulge into it but,
we always try to help our poor relations or

146
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:56,330
poor people. So he always had four five boys
studying. They stayed in our house and they

147
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,129
looked after them. One of them, did his matriculation
then he was doing his intermediate. He felt

148
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:06,909
little obliged and he said: ‘Sir if you
allow me I would like to teach your children’.

149
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:13,909
He said: ‘All right go ahead’. We had
two, gates to enter the house one, which went

150
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,239
through the, courtyard another through his
office. One day I don’t know why he came

151
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:26,279
through his office and immediately my father
stood up for him. Know he was extremely embarrassed

152
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:32,860
you see, he didn’t know, just thought, everybody
got up. Who is this gentleman has come? Then

153
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,119
he went inside, and he told My mother that:
‘I touch your feet but tell Sahib not to

154
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:44,119
get up for me it is too much I can’t just
bear it’. My father came in and he said:

155
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:50,369
‘Why should you be embarrassed? If I don’t
respect you, then my children won’t respect

156
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:57,369
you.’ You must try to be nobler people,
it’s ignoble habits, should be given up

157
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,539
otherwise your children will be ignoble.

158
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:11,299
Now whatever has to be paid to the teachers
has to be paid. Apart from that sometimes,

159
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,580
you must in the presence of children you must
try to give them some presents or some flowers,

160
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:23,580
respect them. That’s what they do in India,
and why most of the rich people donate money.

161
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Absolutely if they have more money they donate,
money to the schools, that’s a sign of a

162
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:40,330
noble person. For a Sahaja Yogi it is important.
Supposing now we have somebody who doesn’t

163
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:47,409
have money or maybe not a job, and he cannot
educate. Now this is a good Sahaja Yogi who

164
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:51,850
has been in Sahaja Yoga for two three years,
has been giving realizations to people but

165
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,850
he doesn’t have a job. It’s our duty in
a way, to support his children to be educated.

166
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,139
See when this hand is self-supporting is all
right. I mean this is self-supporting is all

167
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:11,139
right, but in case it needs the support of
this, this has to give the support.

168
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,049
As we call scholarships or sometimes we call,
now we have got at least five or six children

169
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:27,049
in our school there, who are absolutely free,
absolutely. Food, some of them I am supporting,

170
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,739
some of them Yogi’s supporting and some
of them are absolutely free, absolutely hundred

171
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:38,739
percent. Will not tell you the names. Their
food their clothes everything and nobody knows.

172
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,950
We don’t want them to develop a feeling
[INAUDIBLE around?]. So all the time, to be

173
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:56,789
very calculating about things is bad. I’ve
seen a complete, manifesto typed [INAUDIBLE]

174
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:03,789
I don’t know what, about having a committee
on top of this little preschool. That is not

175
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:11,639
proper. It’s conditioning, everything, even
if you have to put these, balloons you’ll

176
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:18,639
have a committee. This committee on top of
that another committee another. Trust, trust

177
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:28,739
and trust. We have now one committee I had
to do it, is called as the finance committee

178
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:39,350
all right. They are all audits, experts and
accountants and they will be here in Sydney.

179
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:47,190
That doesn’t mean Sydney is dominating as
someone. Some subjects have to be central,

180
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:54,519
as in any government. That you should understand,
and that these can go and see your accounts

181
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:03,529
if they’re all right or not. But nobody
has to dominate in Sahaja Yoga, we have to

182
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,609
help support and trust.

183
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:18,029
Now in this preschool I find there are only
seven children of that age group who are studying.

184
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:25,029
There are smaller children also. I have suggested
to him that why not use this area for the

185
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:29,230
school there’s a school there. And I would
like children to be in My Room than anybody

186
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:36,230
else. So use this. You save money like that
and children will feel comforted. Everybody

187
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,700
should see if they have time what can I do
for children, can I come and help you. Instead

188
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,179
of that, how much money you spend this that.
You see there’s no income tax in Sahaja

189
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,989
Yoga, is there? We want to get rid of these
kind of things. Everybody feels frightened

190
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:04,989
and insecure, all the time. Forget about these
things. Trust. You don’t know how many thousands

191
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:13,710
of dollars I’ve lost, by trusting people.
Thousands. But we have to trust. What can

192
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:21,629
you do? We have to pay for our principles.
The main principle is trusting and not to

193
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:26,989
ask about money where is what what is right.

194
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:32,519
The second is a very bad situation here is,
because every parent can go and interfere

195
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:38,279
with the teacher. Because they think they
are paying for it. You’ll spoil your children

196
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:45,279
completely. Should never never interfere with
the teachers, never. With the school. I mean

197
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:01,659
if you don’t have money all right. Again
you can have a committee, to find out if they

198
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:09,470
really don’t have money or not. But if somebody
says I have no money I have no job all right.

199
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,470
Somebody should help them But it should not
be a kind of a police force behind these teachers,

200
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:22,179
or behind the school or behind the leader.
Where is the money gone where is that gone

201
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:28,869
this that? Those who worry too much of money
will never have money I tell you. Though I

202
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:35,869
lose money quite a lot, but I get double I
tell you, never a problem. I never have a

203
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,529
problem of money, never never never. One must
trust.

204
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:49,529
I’ll tell you one example, very nice example,
which shows how Sahaja Yoga works out things.

205
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:57,690
I went down to Rome, and we wanted to start
a school in Rome. We saw the land everything

206
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:07,739
is very nice, but we had to deposit the money
immediately. And Guido said: ‘Mother we

207
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:14,739
need about sixteen thousand pounds worth of
liras to deposit this’. I said: ‘I don’t

208
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:20,539
know if I have that money with Me in the bank
or not. I’ll have to see, but doesn’t

209
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:27,299
matter’. I reached the airport and I was
leaving. Suddenly, Sandra came with a packet

210
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:34,299
and she said: ‘Mother this I have saved
for You’. I said: ‘What is this?’ ‘This

211
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:41,649
is money, liras’. I said: ‘But why I don’t
need I don’t take any money why why do you

212
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:48,229
give Me?’. Suddenly it struck Me. ‘How
much it is? What is the value?’ She said:

213
00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:55,229
‘Sixteen thousand pounds’. I said: ‘That’s
it’. So I got that money from her. I said:

214
00:27:55,359 --> 00:28:01,269
‘All right give Me give Me I’ll take it,
and give it to Guido’. I said: ‘Guido

215
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:08,269
go and book your… He booked that. Then it
so happened that, the whole thing fizzled

216
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:18,609
out, and he got back his money again, like
a bad penny.

217
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:24,710
So we were starting this Shudy Camps. I went
there. Guido said: ‘Mother don’t change

218
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,710
your money. I have got all these liras with
me. All the things that I had to buy were

219
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:41,440
bathroom fittings and all the, what you call
the wc’s and all that, plus the, all the

220
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,440
marble and all the curtains and what not,
every sort of thing. And do you know, in one

221
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:58,359
day I did all that, for such a big place like
Shudy, in one day, really. It was a fast movement.

222
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:07,489
And after that, I told them that you pay them
and send Me the bill what ever it is. I also

223
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:12,090
gave them hundred pounds more I said: ‘These
curtains are very nice also get some more

224
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:18,929
for Me maybe, because they’re dark shade’.
And can you imagine when the bill came it

225
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:25,929
was sixteen thousand one hundred pounds. Exactly.
So I had forgotten about hundred. I said:

226
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:35,479
‘How is it sixteen thousand, what have you
done? Must be some manipulation’. They said:

227
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:40,499
‘Mother no it’s, grace of God it has worked
out’. I said: ‘Then this one hundred from

228
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:47,460
where?’ ‘It’s Yours. You gave us. You
forgot, this is Yours’. Then we bought the

229
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:54,460
land and sold it for double the price and
now they have an Ashram.

230
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,600
But where people are stingy about money, think
about money, things do not work out. And also

231
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:09,039
worth knowing, when we bought these two very
big Ashrams in Rome, I don’t know if anybody

232
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:16,039
has seen them, here, very big, two Ashrams
we’ve got them. That too, I told him just

233
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:25,009
be on the lookout. So he said: ‘Mother there
is one advertisement for a house, nearer the

234
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,739
main road or something’. I said: ‘Main
road won’t be good’. ‘No no it’s quite

235
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:36,700
in the inside but it’s away from the main
city. I said: ‘Have you seen it?’ ‘No’.

236
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,409
I said: ‘I have no time now, you’re telling
Me now, and I have to catch the plane’.

237
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:48,729
He said: ‘Mother I had no time to tell You’.
Luckily that day we heard that the plane was

238
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:52,889
cancelled because there was some trouble.
I said: ‘Very good, now we have got one

239
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:58,309
day’. I said: ‘Can you talk to the owner
and ask him if he would like to show Me the

240
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:05,309
place’. The owner accepted, and We went
there about, three o’clock, reached there

241
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:14,470
about three. My plane was about eight, to
India. So immediately I saw this, and that

242
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:23,970
amount which we had spent, I mean, for the
buying of the land had doubled and we could

243
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,559
buy both the houses. And it’s such a big
land. Immediately I said: ‘Buy it now.’

244
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,299
We bought it and I caught My plane and went
to India.

245
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:41,099
Nobody will believe that in such a short time
we got that beautiful, it’s a very very

246
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:48,099
beautiful school, and also very beautiful
area. Just see it worked out. So I have a

247
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:58,659
feeling that, when you start worrying about
money it slips out somehow, nothing works

248
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:05,659
out. To feel the grace is to leave everything
to God, now you do it I don’t know. You’ll

249
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:14,729
be amazed how things work out. It’s beautifully,
it works out and you’re amazed because that’s

250
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:21,369
how you know that you have the blessings,
how God has blessed you. Money is what, is

251
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:28,369
the dust of His Feet. So, I told you when
I came these people Customs troubled Me I

252
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:39,779
said: ‘I don’t know what they are going
to have now here in recession’. But doesn’t

253
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,830
matter. It’s not going to affect you at
all, if you are in a witness state you can

254
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:52,830
see all that, and things will work out, everybody
will have sufficient money, but don’t worry.

255
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:02,249
And the more money people have, the more they
are worried about money I have seen that.

256
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:07,769
Those who have less in any case they know
that they have less so what is there to worry,

257
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:13,999
like Me.

258
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:20,999
But about school now, we have three classes
and I’ve already talked to Stephan, let

259
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:28,080
him solve the problem. If you find anything
wrong, you can tell them, but no parents should

260
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:36,629
go and disturb the teachers, absolutely. You
have no right to do that. Even I would say,

261
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,279
Indian school. Nicely all the people go, stay
there this, in which school is it allowed

262
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,239
like this? After this, all those who have
to see their children have to stay in a hotel

263
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:03,599
and see them only on a particular date which
is being told that you have to see. You’ll

264
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:10,220
be disturbing your children all the time.
It’s not that anybody can go anytime live

265
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,150
there nicely, and interfere with the working
of the school. We have to bring some system

266
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:22,150
into it, otherwise your children will suffer.
Even the Dharamshala school was really absolutely

267
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:31,780
there were a visitation, of all these bhootish
people, they tortured the lives of these teachers

268
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,929
there. This is never done.

269
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,929
So now next time, nobody is going to go there
like this. I have told him, that if they’re

270
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,280
going to Dharamshala then they should stay
in a hostel, and the children can also stay

271
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,280
with you, not hostel we can call it a kind
of a, inn or it is a, can call it, what is

272
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:03,790
it a, it’s not a big hotel but a kind of
a inn sort of thing. You can take your children

273
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:09,520
there with you, but you should not go to the
school all the time, and sit with them, because

274
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,520
even there they have to study. The trouble
is, Indian standards are very high. All the

275
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,580
children, though they have holidays, only
take holidays for one month and the rest of

276
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,600
the time they are all studying. You’ll see
how your children will improve, they don’t

277
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:33,600
know even how to spell c-a-t cat. Because
of the interference of the parents children

278
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:42,430
are so bad. So now if you have real love for
your children allow them to grow properly,

279
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,850
and you’ll see how they’ll come up.

280
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:52,850
Another thing they have no immunity for anything.
Like if there’s any jaundice, they are the

281
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,080
first to get it, if there’s malaria they
are the first to get it, if there’s typhoid

282
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,870
they are first to get it. While Indian children
have that immunity, because I have seen here

283
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:13,430
also, everybody is carrying the child. Don’t
touch the child all the time. Keep the child

284
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:20,430
away from your body, has that, warmth which
goes to the child also. Yes sometimes you

285
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,240
have to look after the child, the child must
know you love the child, but all the time

286
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,100
carrying the child like this, I have seen
many ladies who are in my lecture also, doing

287
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:38,100
like this. Why what is the need? You make
the child so much conditioned, and the child

288
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:46,230
cannot remain quiet unless you do like this.
Massage the child nicely. Massaging is very

289
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,430
good. You should massage yourselves also,
but at least the child. Let them learn how

290
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,130
to take bath everyday. Everyday they must
be cleansed, so that they develop the habit

291
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,270
of cleanliness. They never wash their hands,
they don’t want to wash their hands, and

292
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,790
their hands smell, they just use paper. Whatever
you tell them they’ll use paper never wash

293
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:15,790
their hands. The hands smell, mouth smells.
With all your development, children have no

294
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:25,810
sense of personal cleanliness.

295
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,290
We have to know that they’re born-realized
children, and that they have to have, a very

296
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:38,150
different type of attitude towards life, as
the same way as the parents have to have,

297
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,650
a very different attitude towards the school.
It’s a very patronizing, and you should

298
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:51,650
be proud that you have such a school here.
Thank God, they are not in the same mess as

299
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:59,650
you have been. It’s so much protection to
them. So change your attitude entirely about

300
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:08,090
the schools, about the children, and look
after them as if you are their trustees. They

301
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,670
are in your trust and also, they should know
that you love them very much, as anybody else

302
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:21,340
also loves them. They must learn how to respect.
They must have good manners.

303
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,300
This can be done when the children are here,
because they don’t know how to say namaste,

304
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,700
they don’t want to say thank you, they don’t
want to say sorry, nothing of the kind. All

305
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,830
the time they’ll go on asking why, why,
and the Indian teachers start looking, Indian

306
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:43,830
children would not. Here they have no right
to ask. They will all be brats here, I tell

307
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,110
you all the children who are going to all
these schools whether private or to the municipal

308
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:55,180
schools. But the other schools that are where
there’s, horrible schools are there here

309
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,100
I know. Because anybody who comes from those
schools, we don’t want to admit them. We

310
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:07,190
have had three of them, we sent them back.
It’s cheaper all right, but we can’t admit.

311
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:14,190
Three children have been sent away. If you
feel that you must share your money with your

312
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:21,210
children, then see that they get proper education,
proper grounding. Of course I am going to

313
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:28,210
make a proper complete sketch of how with
the teachers, how to deal with the children,

314
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,820
how to make them understand, how to put them
into proper way.

315
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,790
But this is a very important age from three
to five years I think. Till one year they

316
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:44,500
should be with the mother and father. But
mother should not too much also all the time,

317
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,500
handle the child, and should look after the
child, in a way as if it is in her trust,

318
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,670
massage the child, look after the child. I’ve
seen some children just go on crying. I don’t

319
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:04,770
know maybe the mothers must have been very
unhappy, when they were bearing the child

320
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:11,770
maybe they had a bad time, with the mother-in-law
maybe with the husband whatever it is. All

321
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:19,580
the time crying. All right that can be corrected,
but they are our property and we have to look

322
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,730
after them. But again I say that doesn’t
mean, that a mother should expect others to

323
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:32,500
give bath or look after them all the time
it’s not so. So I hope you’ll use your

324
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,870
discretion now as far as your children are
concerned. I am very much concerned about

325
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,960
them.

326
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,950
Now the story goes about, people start talking
like that. About the Indian school there’s

327
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:53,760
lot of criticism. I would like to know how
much you have paid for the school, to build.

328
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,760
It’s only your children studying there,
nobody else’s. How much money did you pay

329
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,960
to buy the land? Nobody enquired. How much
it has cost to build this school? Nobody enquired.

330
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:16,730
But if you are sending about, ten dollars
for their food and everything. Hundred and

331
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:29,990
fifty dollars for four weeks, where they eat
their food, live there, they have all facilities,

332
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:38,310
everything, plus their education. But that
will be very much discussed. You have to know

333
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,400
that it’s a very big headache to teach the
western children in India because every money

334
00:41:53,830 --> 00:42:00,830
has to be accounted for our FERanies Foreign
Exchange Regulations, and every six months

335
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:10,310
we have to give the report, to the Reserve
Bank of India, how we are spending this foreign

336
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,040
exchange. And they are experts. Despite all
that, the people loose-tonguers are saying:

337
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:37,520
‘Somebody is eating the money there’.
It’s very difficult, you don’t know, to

338
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,760
manage the western children in India, first
of all as they are, and then secondly, that

339
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:55,600
the government is on top of our head, they’re
sitting.

340
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:03,060
Then third is about food. Your children are
used to tinned foods. Like they’ll say we

341
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,730
want baked beans in the morning. We want this,
we want that, every child wants something

342
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:09,730
else. Now the people will go crazy cooking
for all of them separately. You have agreed

343
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:10,760
to such a thing, all right you want this habit.
You should not compromise: ‘No, better eat

344
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,880
this’. He won’t eat today, he’ll eat
tomorrow. Whatever is cooked for everybody

345
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,240
in the family please have it. And these tinned
fruits I am absolutely against it and I am

346
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,490
sure you also don’t want them to have tinned
fruits. They want to have, fried fish and

347
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,590
baked beans and potato chips. That’s all
they know about food nothing more, or less.

348
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:12,680
So don’t send them any tinned fruits, foods,
tinned fruits. I think you better not send

349
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:12,770
them any food, is a better idea. Because if
you send them chocolates, their liver will

350
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:12,860
be spoiled. They are getting everything there,
so please if you have to give you can give

351
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,510
them clothes or anything, but not something
to eat. Somebody brought lots of chocolates.

352
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,920
That’s how they got this, problem. Chocolates
should be avoided for children up to some

353
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,390
age, and also ice cream, but ice cream still
is not so much fat, but chocolate specially.

354
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:14,640
You can have lollipops and all those things
they are perfectly all right, lollies are

355
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,850
all right.

356
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,850
Be careful as to what habits you give to them.
And tinned food should never be given to children.

357
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,850
It’s very bad. There’s some preservation,
and for that preservation they put some chemicals

358
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,920
and that’s why the children are very susceptible.
They have no immunity. It’s easy to get

359
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,180
fresh things here. Not difficult specially
in Australia, you have no problem. Get them

360
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,430
fresh things, fresh fruits, fresh food. You
should give them. If you form that habit and

361
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:15,650
not from restaurants and thing. See everything
you get it in the market bring it home, and

362
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:15,880
just shove it into thing and give them. No.
For children be careful. Once you spoil their

363
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,230
stomachs it’s difficult to make them all
right. So be very very careful as to what

364
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,670
kind of food you are giving, even if you have
to give something, then you should read what

365
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,720
is in it you see. If there are anything artificial
things please try to avoid. These are very

366
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,610
precious children we have, and we have to
look after them.

367
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:19,860
Again and again I would request you, to be
very kind, to Me by looking after them in

368
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,090
a proper sensible manner, till they are with
you. Also you have to give them some discipline.

369
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,840
It’s very important. By giving them self-esteem:
‘You are Sahaja Yogis you are this’. If

370
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,090
you give them, they have no self-esteem at
all. If you give them the self-esteem you’ll

371
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,110
be surprised they’ll start behaving very
well. By saying that see: ‘You are special

372
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,130
children, you are Sahaj Yogis, you can’t
behave like that,’ how they have to be.

373
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,220
There has to be some discipline, otherwise
at the age of six years you cannot start,

374
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,280
and even if you start it, it takes some time.
It’s exhausting, absolutely exhausting.

375
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,330
Some children are very exhausting.

376
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,100
So I hope you’ll remember this. We have
to be kind and nice, discreet, sweet to them,

377
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,680
but first we should know what is going to
be helpful to them, what is benevolent for

378
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:22,930
them. And just some book comes about children,
you read it, done. In Sahaja Yoga you don’t

379
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:22,970
have to read all such books. I’m already
going to write and I’ve already told you

380
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,090
these things. Just in a wider way, you use
your discretion. After all you are all realized

381
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,610
souls and the spirit within you, can see in
the light of that, what is good for your child.

382
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,020
But avoid tinned food as far as possible.
Anything tinned is horrible and please don’t

383
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,360
take that for your children. I think you people
all need not also have tinned food what is

384
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,610
the need?. This cancer and all that so rampant,
in the west. In India, thank God at least

385
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:24,740
what ever poor they may be they don’t eat
tin food. We can’t afford. In tin food is

386
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:24,820
more expensive in India than fresh food, because
tin is expensive, luckily.

387
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,500
All right, so now this is we have done, I
have a little present for your, leader. You’re

388
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,570
an inch short of one pen, so I borrowed his,
and he said that: ‘Mother You have already

389
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:26,820
given me a pen’. I forget. I hope I have
never given you a watch. I never gave you

390
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:26,860
a watch so you can’t say anything. All right
this is one and today is his wife’s birthday.

391
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:26,890
So let us sing something for her, and a little
present for her. May God bless. What a nice

392
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:26,930
day to be here when it’s your birthday.
May God bless.

393
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:26,950
Now last but not the least, very important
thing is that the senior people in Sahaja

394
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,100
Yoga should not be called by their names.
We can say Uncle or something Uncle Tom, is

395
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,150
to be done. It’s very important, and even
I’ve heard some Indian girls calling somebody:

396
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
‘John’. I said: ‘What? He’s like your
father. How can you call like that?’ ‘Our

397
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
husbands insist.’ No, please, call them
with some sort of a uncle and aunty. Shouldn’t

398
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
say like that, it’s not proper, doesn’t
look nice. Or address to elders always: ‘Sir’

399
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
is a better idea. Shows you have some culture.
We are not brats, first of all. And also we

400
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
are not people who are hippies, you see. We
have to respect the elders. Very important,

401
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
it is that we have to respect all the elders,
that are within you. That’s how you will

402
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
be respected also. See to it that those ladies
or gentlemen who are senior people always

403
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
call them by, either ‘Mr’ or ‘Uncle’
or ‘Aunt’.

404
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
He was all the time with Me but I somehow
or other sneaked out tying. Ah beautiful.

405
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Suits your hand very well. It’s really very
[INAUDIBLE] Very very [INAUDIBLE] All right,

406
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
so on a very happy note we should end up now.
Feel very sorry that I have to leave you all

407
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
here, and there are people waiting, as you
know in the eastern Asian countries for Me,

408
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
counting every minute, so I have to go.

409
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: Shri Mother before you go. It’s
not quite over. We have a little presentation

410
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
for You.

411
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: Ah no. You see you can’t…

412
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: Although it is Your…

413
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: It’s not My Birthday.

414
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: No Shri Mataji. But as it is the month
of March Shri Mother we feel that we can celebrate

415
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Your Birthday in a small way but…

416
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: You have already given Me. Oh
chandan.

417
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: First we would like to..

418
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: Oh maa. It’s the, beautiful.
How can I blow so many candles. I think you’d

419
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
better do it for Me.

420
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: It’s a map of Australia Shri Mother.

421
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: Is it? Ah.

422
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280

426
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280

432
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: And the second part also. Very

433
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Leader: A little piece on the side. We vow

435
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,280
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Beautiful,
beautiful. Children, you must see what Austrians

436
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,360
have sent Me is beautiful things, and they
wanted Me to be there for My Birthday but

437
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,700
I don’t know how I’ll do it. In any case
you can have a look at the way they have wished

438
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:27,950
Me. Oh, this is very beautiful. Children have
done it? Oh My. What’s that?

439
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:27,990
Leader: I’m not sure Shri Mother. I’m
trying to find my way into it.

440
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,020
Shri Mataji: Prohibited. So beautiful it is.
It’s too much, much too much. I don’t

441
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,020
know what to say because, pearls are, the
Adoration of the Sahasrara you know that.

442
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,020
There are stones on different chakras of which,
every chakra is made and the pearls are for

443
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,030
the Sahasrara. So beautiful of you to think
of that. It’s very kind. Thank you. Thank

444
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,030
you very much. Now you’ve bought it but
I’m now going to cancel also pearls from

445
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,040
My list.

446
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,040
Leader: And one final thing Shri Mother You
travel so much You have so many things to

447
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,040
remember we noticed You looked at one of these
and You thought it might be useful.

448
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:28,040
Shri Mataji: Ah. I’ll need somebody to operate
it. Just imagine. Budget planning period.

449
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,050
What a joke. Now then this, morning meetings.
As soon as You come out of Your bed it starts.

450
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,050
Then lunch engagements. Plan next meetings.
Then interviews. Finished.

451
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,050
Leaders: Not for those Shri Mother but for
telephone numbers and, all those sort of things

452
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,060
that You have to keep somewhere.

453
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,060
Shri Mataji: It’s quite a lot of things
I must say. I am very bad at, but somebody

454
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,060
has to look after it, because I don’t understand,
how will I work it out. [HINDI] Two thousand

455
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,070
five hundred ninety names and numbers, and
one thousand eight hundred and twenty scheduled

456
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,070
appointments. Large forty character by eight
line display. What are these characters are?

457
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,080
Leader: We have one appointment to put in
there straight away Shri Mother and that is

458
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,080
for the early part of next year in Australia.

459
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,080
Shri Mataji: Oh My. And the best part is,
that built in help, screens available, for

460
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,090
major functions at the touch of a button but
how do you find the button. You see these

461
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,090
buttons are so soft You just touch anywhere,
they work. All right so thank you very much

462
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,090
I hope I’ll learn something. Thank you very
much thank you. What these are doughnuts?

463
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,100
Yogi: Profiteroles. Profiteroles.

464
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,100
Shri Mataji: Oh. Oh My. Nobody has eaten so
far I’m the only One. [INAUDIBLE] Thank

465
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:28,100
you very much. I must thank you all for really
making everyday new things for Me, taking

466
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,110
so much trouble looking after Me so well.
I feel very comfortable, all the time with

467
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,110
My children and, I was driven around in a
very comfortable car. I’ve really enjoyed.

468
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,110
And I don’t look as if I’ve done the tour
already, I’m quite fresh.

469
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,120
Leader: Disappeared strangely Shri Mother
none of us know quite how it came about

470
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,120
but it’s all bits of Australia. We thought
You might like it. It’s a calendar. Of the

471
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,120
Snowy Mountains. Doesn’t look real does
it.

472
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,130
Shri Mataji: It’s very nice. What colors,
very colorful country. Just imagine. Unbelievable.

473
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,130
Thank you very much, thank you. It’s beautiful.
Thank you very much, beautiful photographs.

474
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,130
I will take your leave now.
