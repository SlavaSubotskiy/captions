1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,380
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
a four day festival called as Diwali.

2
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,980
Diwali comes from the word ‘dipali’; ‘dipali’
in Sanskrit.

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,220
The word ‘deepa’ means ‘the lights’,
and ‘ali’ means the ‘line’, the ‘rows’.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,980
Now, there are many things that have happened
during these four days and that’s how it

5
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:45,360
is celebrated with such a great enthusiasm.

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,520
The first thing is the day of the Lakshmi’s
birth.

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,570
That is the thirteenth day of the moon, “dhanteras’
they call it.

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:05,239
[Which] is the real day when Lakshmi was born
out of the sea; that’s why She is called

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,500
as Miriam or Maryam.

10
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:20,009
The word ‘Marie’ or ‘Marine’, also
comes from the word ‘sea’.

11
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:31,289
So, She’s born out of the sea, She’s created
out of the sea.

12
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:41,090
And the wealth of the sea, so far, thank God,
human beings have not yet exploited.

13
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,020
But they may, one day, start doing that also.

14
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,130
And a lot of wealth is still there, so when
people start getting worried about exhausting

15
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:00,170
the Mother Earth, we must know that sea is
much more than the Earth is, so nothing is

16
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,170
exhausted.

17
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:10,709
Still there is such a lot in reserve for you,
and one should not worry as to the supply

18
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,120
of wealth that can come from the sea.

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:26,140
Now, this Lakshmi is the goddess who stands
on the lotus.

20
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:51,770
She represents all the well-being, the wealth,
the glory of wealth, the decoration of wealth;

21
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,910
whichever is auspicious.

22
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,870
Whatever is not auspicious is not wealth according
to Sahaja Yoga, or according to any scripture.

23
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,890
It is not wealth at all.

24
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:14,980
So She is a lady who stands on a lotus: showing
that a person, who has got wealth, has to

25
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:23,730
be a person who doesn’t assert his pressures
on people, who doesn’t push people around,

26
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,500
who doesn’t pressurise.

27
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
And then She’s a lady, She’s a mother.

28
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:45,609
So wealth, is the first opening to our seeking.

29
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:49,719
But when you start seeking the wealth, you
realise that the superficial wealth that you

30
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:54,969
are seeking is not sufficient, is not going
to give you complete joy.

31
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:58,590
So you start seeking the deeper wealth.

32
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,689
As I said that: on the Mother Earth you have
exploited all that is possible [but] still

33
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,219
there, deep down in the sea, a lot of wealth
is still there.

34
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:13,099
So then the seeking moves towards the deeper
seeking.

35
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:17,419
So the same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

36
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:26,610
When you start expanding yourself to higher
and deeper, valuable things then this Lakshmi

37
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:36,560
doesn’t lure you much: She’s just there
for your glory, but not for your satisfaction.

38
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,890
The wealth is there for distribution only.

39
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:48,220
You enjoy the…there’s no word for ‘dhan’
[in English] I think?

40
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,780
Yogi: Generosity.

41
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,900
Shri Mataji: Oh, “generosity’!

42
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,009
But generosity is different.

43
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,470
But what I’m saying [is] generous fondness.

44
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,669
It’s a fondness that you should be generous.

45
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:18,750
Sometimes it’s a very great 

46
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,060
happiness and joy that you feel — that is
the greatest — when you are generous, when

47
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,199
you give away.

48
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,889
That’s a fondness, that’s a kind of a
human expression of one’s own being: that

49
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,210
you want to be generous.

50
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,699
And this generosity only can come when Mahalakshmi
principle is born in you.

51
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:49,880
But at Lakshmi principle also She stands like
this; Her hand is like this one: as giving.

52
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,400
And the other is like this.

53
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,820
So miserliness is not a sign of wealth.

54
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,470
I mean, if you are miserly that means you
are not wealthy.

55
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,680
If you are really wealthy, why will you be
miserly?

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,730
This simple question is there.

57
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:11,240
That means if you are really wealthy, you
will just give away.

58
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,780
If you cannot give away, then you are poor,
you are a beggar.

59
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,129
[If] you are still hankering after that, that
means you are still a beggar, and you are

60
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,129
hankering for it.

61
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,690
So [with] this left hand She is giving all
the time, and with the right hand She protects

62
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,720
people.

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,979
She gives protection to people.

64
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:40,900
The wealth must give protection to people,
in the way [that] it must look after the well

65
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:49,080
being of others, not your own self-indulgence:
like having all the best things to yourself

66
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,970
while others are starving.

67
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,080
That’s not a sign of a wealthy man.

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,780
A wealthy man is a person who knows that,
unless and until he shares his things with

69
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,690
others, he is not going to be happy, ultimately.

70
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,210
For the time being he may be.

71
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,639
People live with imbalances, they live with
wrong ideas.

72
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,099
But ultimately they have to correct it.

73
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:18,780
If they do not correct this, there are problems.

74
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,810
Then there’s upheaval, lots of changes come
in.

75
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,789
People start seeing that, “Oh, this doesn’t
work out, that doesn’t work out."

76
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:34,790
The children run away from the houses, the
family goes into problems.

77
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,430
All sorts of things happen, and then they
realise, “This is the reason: I have been

78
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,430
very miserly.

79
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,680
I have not been generous.

80
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,090
I have not been using money for the sake of
others."

81
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,419
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you become
a Divine person.

82
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:51,600
Definitely you become Divine.

83
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,159
You are now a Divine personality, you are
not a human personality.

84
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,689
So you have to give up all that is human within
you, then only you will be fully Divine.

85
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,250
But it’s very difficult.

86
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,199
That’s [what] the problem is: that it is
very difficult to really accept that you are

87
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,639
Divine, and that you have to take to Divine
policies and Divine attitudes, and Divine

88
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,639
temperament.

89
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,100
Now, the Divine temperament is generous.

90
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,630
It is not bothered, as to what happens next.

91
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,949
It’s not bothered, because it is connected
with the Source.

92
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,669
If you give one you will get a hundred.

93
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,900
It is sure about it.

94
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,010
And to a Divine person, worldly things have
no meaning, if they cannot give pleasures

95
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,010
to others.

96
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,950
A person who is very self-indulgent, always
bothered about himself, is not a Divine person

97
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,950
at all.

98
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,380
In no way he’s Divine.

99
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,850
It’s very common.

100
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,850
It’s human.

101
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,410
Everybody does that.

102
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,730
Everybody is self-preserving.

103
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,079
But after Sahaja Yoga, you do not start all
this nonsense again; you give it up.

104
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,170
And who looks after you?

105
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,130
Who looks after your self-preservation?

106
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,980
Is God Almighty.

107
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,209
You are now completely dedicated to Him, and
He looks after you.

108
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:17,670
You don’t have to worry as to how to look
after yourself, how to do this, how to do

109
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,670
that.

110
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,670
It is His work.

111
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,680
The more you go on worrying about yourself,
the worse it will be.

112
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,170
The moment you give it up, it is looked after.

113
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,840
Many Sahaja Yogis must have experienced this
in their lifetime: that when they try to give

114
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,360
it up, they get all the help from God; but
whenever they try to assert, and worry about

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,420
their well-being and things like that, then
there is a problem.

116
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,540
You don’t know from where the help comes
in.

117
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,030
And we have had so many examples, so many
so-called miracles, where people wanted to

118
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,709
do something, and suddenly they got the money
from somewhere they least expected.

119
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:08,940
So for a Divine person, the attitude should
be of giving and of protection: protect.

120
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:18,700
Now, we are very good at protecting our bhoots,
and protecting others who are bhoots.

121
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,370
You see, the sympathies always go to bhoots,
because they have a way of creating a sympathetic

122
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,050
attitude in your heart.

123
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:34,300
So you start looking after that person because
that person looks so much miserable.

124
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,120
You have to protect the saints.

125
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,090
You have to protect the principle of God,
the Divinity in others, and not the bhoots.

126
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,930
You are not here to care for all the bhoots
of the world.

127
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,420
So the idea of Lakshmi must be understood
in a proper way.

128
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:02,120
In Sahaja Yoga it’s a very different thing
from all other people know about; like charity.

129
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,960
Like, people say now, “We must be charitable,
start a charitable organisation."

130
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,740
In that, you look after this kind of people,
that kind of people.

131
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
We are not bothered.

132
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,300
That’s not [what] you are given Realisation
for: to look after every sort of a person.

133
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:24,000
You are here to look after all the saints
and all born-realised children.

134
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,730
And you are not to bother about people who
do not matter to God and Divine.

135
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,820
When they came to Realisation, if they get
Realisation, if they become saints, all right.

136
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:39,080
But you don’t worry about every Dick, Tom
and Harry, on the street: “Oh Mother, he’s

137
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,620
so miserable!” and this and that.

138
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,910
So the charity must be understood in a Divine
light.

139
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,029
And the Divine light will give you discretion,
to understand whom to be charitable [to].

140
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:57,339
You have to be charitable to your brothers
and sisters.

141
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,760
You have to be kind to them.

142
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,790
Now you will say: “What about worrying about,
Mother, people who are starving?

143
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,870
Who are this?”

144
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,240
That’s not your headache!

145
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,019
Why should you do their jobs?

146
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,510
You are all good at doing others’ jobs.

147
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,740
For example, you are driving in the car: “Oh,
look at this!

148
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,420
There should have been this properly done!

149
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,019
That they should have done properly!” but
that’s not your job!Why should you waste

150
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,290
your energy in finding out what the others
should have done?

151
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,899
You should do what you have to do.

152
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,100
And don’t waste your energy in these things.

153
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,950
You see, [in] all these charitable institutions,
I have seen [that] those people who work there

154
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,850
are very difficult for Realisation.

155
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,740
This is the proof of the pudding.

156
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,730
Because to whom to do the charity?

157
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,839
If there is no other person, you do not do
charity to anyone!

158
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,260
I mean, sitting down here, I can do charities
to people, so-called, which are not charities,

159
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,699
they are part and parcel of my being.

160
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,990
I just do it, because they are part and parcel
of my being.

161
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,880
I don’t have to go all out to sacrifice
something to do charity, because that’s

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:15,149
nothing but ego pampering and ego-oriented:
“Oh, I have helped this man, and how dare

163
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,490
he say such a thing!”

164
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,589
So this is one quality of the Divine, one
should know, that It is generous.

165
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:33,300
It is generous to a fault, to a fault.

166
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,890
It is generous because It is generous.

167
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,890
It is not bothered.

168
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,710
It doesn’t reason out Itself: “Why should
I be generous?”

169
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,839
It is generous because It is; because it’s
the whim, it’s a fondness.

170
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,589
The fondness of generosity is such, as you
have fondness, say, people have fondness to

171
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,790
drink, for example let’s say.

172
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,190
That’s not fondness, that’s a habit, I
think.

173
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,029
But you can say some fondness people have.

174
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,580
What kind of a fondness you have, without
forming a habit, I don’t know.

175
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,850
Because you always have a habit and then you
form the fondness.

176
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,980
But supposing you just have a fondness.

177
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:20,699
For example, you are fond of, say, good food,
let us take it.

178
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:27,190
Now, if you have fondness of good food, then
you will just do it because you are fond of

179
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,190
it.

180
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,230
Now if somebody says, “Why are you fond
of good food?”

181
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,660
You said, “I am just fond – finished!

182
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,509
Who are you to ask me such a question?”

183
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:41,339
If somebody is fond of generosity, he will
be generous whether you like it or not.

184
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:47,930
And it is sometimes, to a reasonable man,
may look to be a bit too much.

185
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,339
The greatest generosity a human being can
do is to forgive.

186
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:58,070
I mean, it’s not generosity to others but
to yourself.

187
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,690
If you forgive others you are generous to
yourself.

188
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,450
First of all be generous to yourself, that
is you forgive everybody else.

189
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:14,430
If you forgive everybody else, then you are
not tortured by them; you spare yourself from

190
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,730
their tortures.

191
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,610
This is a generosity towards yourself.

192
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:26,410
Towards yourself, the greatest generosity
is that you do not bear any malice or bitterness

193
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,470
about anyone.

194
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,959
But clear-cut ideas that, “He’s like this
and he is like this."

195
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,020
Just a clear-cut idea, but no reaction out
of it.

196
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,250
If somebody is a man, say, he’s bhootish:
all right he’s a bhootish fellow, we know

197
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,889
he’s a bhootish, keep yourself in bandhan,
but don’t have a reaction out of that.

198
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:51,399
Then you have really forgiven everyone.

199
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,640
Forgiveness gives you a big kavacha; is a
big bandhan, is a big protection, we can say,

200
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,040
a shield, from all kinds of evil that other’s
can put on you.

201
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,170
Just forgive them, and then you see what happens
to them.

202
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:15,910
You just try this trick: just forgive, and
see what happens to others who try to torture

203
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,910
you.

204
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,730
Of course, the Divine never wants to torture
anyone; that is definite.

205
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,240
It never wants to torture.

206
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,290
It is extremely generous, It likes to forgive.

207
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,410
It enjoys Its forgiveness, It really enjoys.

208
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,790
Generosity is to be enjoyed in the same way
forgiveness is to be enjoyed.

209
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,589
It’s very enjoyable.

210
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:43,510
When you forgive others it’s the most enjoyable
thing, that you see the play, you become the

211
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,510
witness.

212
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,490
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa, when it develops
into you: first of all you have to forgive

213
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,460
if somebody has borrowed money from you and
has not returned — it doesn’t matter.

214
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,360
It’s difficult for people to forgive people
who borrow money and don’t give.

215
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:12,170
(laughter) And beyond that is also another
problem I have seen (laughing) that: if you

216
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,130
lend some money to somebody, then run away
from that person.

217
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,690
Because even to give is easier, but [to] take
is even worse.

218
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:25,990
A person who takes money from you, will never
forgive you all your life, because you have

219
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,150
lent money to him!

220
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,420
So, one has to understand that, when you become
Divine, you just give.

221
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,210
You just give.

222
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,470
This is Mahalakshmi tattwa.

223
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,540
Mahalakshmi tattwa is that you give.

224
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,550
Don’t worry about what is the result, how
others react to it, what happens to it, what

225
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,790
is the ultimate result, and what you achieve
out of it, and how the person has taken.

226
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,790
Just give!

227
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,190
That is Mahalakshmi tattwa.

228
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:04,170
But when I say give, also you must use discretion.

229
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,020
That is the part we always forget.

230
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:14,510
Sahaja Yoga must teach you discretion, that
is the Divine truth.

231
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,580
Divine is the most discreet thing.

232
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,670
Now, when I say, “Give,” I know people
will just start running on the street, finding

233
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,960
out somebody where you can give something!

234
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,760
You don’t have to run about to find out
somebody that you should give something to

235
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,850
someone: there’s no need.

236
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,420
It’s just flowing.

237
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,980
It’s just flowing.

238
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:51,000
Whenever the chance is, just try to give:
material things, something kind words, sweetness,

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,500
comfort.

240
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:00,690
But never give one thing, which I sometimes
do by mistake: never give advice! (laughter)

241
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:14,530
That’s a very dangerous thing.

242
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:20,559
You can give bandhan, you can beat the person
at his back with shoes.

243
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,280
But never give an advice in words.

244
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,670
That is one of the principles of Sahaja Yoga,
for the time being.

245
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,430
Because giving advice, you know what it means.

246
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,990
You may have a boxed nose or something!

247
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,410
It’s a very dangerous thing.

248
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,880
So best is, on that part I would say, as far
as advice is concerned: you have so many ways

249
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,280
and methods of handling a situation.

250
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,350
So better not speak about it, just handle
it in complete silence.

251
00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:02,220
Whatever you have to do about a person, just
handle him without talking to that person.

252
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,370
The more you try to convince the person, the
worse he will get.

253
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,260
Because they are not Divine.

254
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,200
They haven’t reached that Divinity.

255
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:19,100
They are a special type of people who cannot
become Divine, and do not break your necks

256
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
with them.

257
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,370
Also don’t give advice to other Sahaja yogis.

258
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,400
Everybody at this stage thinks that they know
all about Sahaja Yoga.

259
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
It’s all right, good idea!

260
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,900
Very good idea!

261
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:40,820
But never try to tell them what they should
do, what is good for them, unless and until

262
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,740
they come and ask.

263
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:52,661
Now, this Mahalakshmi tattwa, when it grows
into collectivity: what happens [is] that

264
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:57,270
you learn that you have to just give, and
you don’t worry about the receiving.

265
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,500
As Krishna has said, “Karmanye vadhikaraste
phaleshou Ma kadachana” (meaning) “Our

266
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,870
job is to do the karmas (the work) and we
are not to worry about the phalas (fruits)."

267
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:16,360
Just try to give whatever is possible to everyone:
vibrations, Realisation.

268
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,810
I know it is wasted so many times — you
give Realisation and it is wasted.

269
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,330
It’s like the seeds that are thrown on the
rocks.

270
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,020
Yes, I know, it is.

271
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,820
So many times I have wasted thousands of them,
but doesn’t matter, you give them.

272
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,950
It is not [that] you are giving them for their
sake, but for your sake.

273
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,630
It is for your satisfaction you are doing
it, for your fondness you are doing it.

274
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:49,130
So just try to give Realisation to everyone,
anyone who asks for it.

275
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,290
But, as Christ has rightly said that, “Don’t
throw pearls before the swines."

276
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:01,460
I mean, I shouldn’t use this word today,
on such an auspicious day, but doesn’t matter.

277
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,770
So, this, He has said it.

278
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,880
Now, this kind of people, who are they?

279
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,880
They are the people who don’t deserve it.

280
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,770
So there is no need to give Realisation to
every person you come across [or] talk to

281
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,770
everyone.

282
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,870
Gradually you will meet such people who will
ask for Sahaja Yoga, for Realisation: you’ll

283
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,440
give it to them.

284
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:33,530
Gradually those pigs, or what you call them,
whatever Christ has called them, they will

285
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,210
evolve, I am sure, one day, and they’ll
come to you.

286
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:47,470
So, let us try on the first level, where there
are genuine seekers of a high level, and you

287
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,010
will be amazed how they are sorted out.

288
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,430
You see, there isn’t much space in the Kingdom
of God, to be very frank.

289
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:03,590
And we should not worry if we don’t have
many people over there.

290
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:10,290
For us, it is a responsibility we must have
all the population of this world going up

291
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,500
there: is a wrong idea.

292
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,720
That’s not needed at all.

293
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,300
We should not crowd them there.

294
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,130
Here only, we can’t sit all of us you see,
we’ll have to have a bigger place.

295
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:28,150
So we should not bother so much as to the
quantity, that the quantity is not much.

296
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,750
Of course we should try our level best to
pass the message; Because they should not

297
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,670
say that, “We didn’t get the message."

298
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,230
To pass the message is all right.

299
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:44,690
But we need not in any way force people or
ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga or make them

300
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,690
Sahaja Yogis.

301
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,690
It’s a difficult thing.

302
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,650
The more you will try, the worse they will
be.

303
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:56,560
They will be so troublesome that it’s going
to be an impossible task.

304
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,640
So in your generosity you must have discretion:
how far to go with people, how far to work

305
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
it out.

306
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:13,280
This is the Mahalakshmi tattwa which comes
to you as a result of Shri Ganesha, who blesses

307
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,210
you with wisdom as to how to be generous with
others, where to give, what to give.

308
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,210
The discretion starts working.

309
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:26,700
You don’t have to think about it, it just
works out.

310
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
It will just work out.

311
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,640
Discretion in Sahaja Yoga doesn’t mean,
at all, thinking or rationally coming to a

312
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,301
conclusion, but it means that it just works
out that way: in the sense that you feel it

313
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,400
in your vibratory awareness.

314
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:54,130
Once such a discretion is developed, you will
be amazed that those who are not to enter

315
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,650
into the Kingdom of God will just shun it,
will not come close to you.

316
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,590
And it’s better for us, less headache, you
see.

317
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,040
Because they think that we need them, while
they don’t know [that] they need Realisation,

318
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
not we.

319
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,750
We have got our Realisation.

320
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:19,010
So this is about generosity, today, I wanted
to tell you; about being generous to Sahaja

321
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,010
Yogis.

322
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,300
Now, I’m not going to tell you that you
go on giving presents to Sahaja Yogis and

323
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,560
all that, because, as you know that, these
material things have no value except they

324
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
have symbolic value.

325
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:38,680
And symbolically if you work for them, and
if symbolically if you try to express yourself,

326
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:46,020
it is going to work out much better than in
a material way: that it should be so expensive,

327
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,330
it should be so much.

328
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,090
That’s not good.

329
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:55,190
Symbolically you should work out material
gifts and things among yourselves.

330
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,750
But the main thing one should understand [is]
that collectivity will only grow when you

331
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,870
do not, by any of your attitude or behaviour,
suggest that others are lower than you or

332
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,040
others are higher than you.

333
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:17,760
For example, you see something straight, you
see quite far away; I see much more than what

334
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,070
you can see.

335
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,900
It’s a fact.

336
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
You know that.

337
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,900
But I don’t tell you.

338
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,320
I just say, “I don’t know, maybe try this,
try that."

339
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,030
I keep quiet.

340
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,280
I just try to play about.

341
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
I say, “All right.

342
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Let’s see."

343
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,760
I’ll consult you, I’ll consult him, everybody
I’ll consult: “All right, try this."

344
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,040
Or I’ll do all these tricks, because I don’t
want you to feel that, “Mother knows everything,

345
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,620
so why should I know?”

346
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,800
First of all you can say that.

347
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,540
Or you may say that, “Mother knows so much,
and I know nothing.

348
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,090
I can never reach Her."

349
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,480
So, what you have to do is to make another
person see as much as you see.

350
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,510
How will you do that?

351
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,470
By being with him all the time, by being in
such a relationship that the other doesn’t

352
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:14,030
feel the oppression: oppression of that personality,
as if that person [thinks], “Oh, he is so

353
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,460
great, he is so great, he knows so many things,
and he’s so evolved.

354
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
What are we?

355
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,150
We are nothing!”

356
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,860
If you develop such an attitude towards a
person, then the other person can also develop

357
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,560
another attitude, just the other way round.

358
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,670
That he’ll oppose such a person, he’ll
stand out, he’ll be angry all the time.

359
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,480
At the slightest pretext, he’ll be off and
he’ll feel hurt and he’ll be miserable.

360
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,520
All these things can come up.

361
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,880
So it is not going to help you, nor the other
person.

362
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,960
But to tell another person, if you want to
raise that person higher, the best thing is

363
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:03,000
to make him your friend, your dearest person,
and let him see as much as you can see, together.

364
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,420
Then the vision is broader.

365
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,360
It’s not that one person sees something
more and others do not see, and the person

366
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,630
who can see, thinks no end of himself.

367
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,320
You should behave in such a manner as if you
don’t know anything, it’s better.

368
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,830
You should see me, how I behave.

369
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,530
I don’t tell you anything, I just say, “All
right, go ahead.

370
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,250
Whatever you think proper, do it."

371
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,570
Then you come round and you say, “Mother
but it happened like this, and you had told

372
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,570
us this way!”

373
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:41,280
So I say, “I told you, all right, but I
didn’t say, “All right, this is going

374
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
to happen!’

375
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,770
” But it happens.

376
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:49,201
So it’s better that you should also develop
that kind of an attitude that, all of us have

377
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,560
to go together.

378
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,810
There’s nobody who can just pull out oneself
ahead.

379
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,880
We all have to go together, even me.

380
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,790
Even if I maybe anything, what does it matter?

381
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,990
What does it matter if God is great?

382
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,990
So what?

383
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,450
He may be great in His own play.

384
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,630
But what do we gain out of Him is the point
that, His greatness should be seen through

385
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,630
us.

386
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,170
If we cannot move up to that point, what’s
the use of His greatness?

387
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,540
It’s better that He’s away.

388
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,250
He’s too great for us.

389
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,820
So He has to come down.

390
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:33,150
He has to come down to this level to make
everybody feel that they are part and parcel

391
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,470
of His own ignorance.

392
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,440
He may be the most knowledgeable person, so
what?

393
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,470
You have to take the cover of the ignorance
upon yourself and go on slowly exposing yourself.

394
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:52,120
In the same way, if you can do it with other
Sahaja Yogis.

395
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:59,690
Then only you could be good leaders, and you
have been really generous with a full discretion.

396
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:08,190
So today’s day is, as I told you, the thirteenth
day is the Goddess.

397
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,550
Dhanteras it is called as.

398
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,580
That is the day of the Gruha Lakshmi; She
came as Gruha Lakshmi.

399
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:23,840
In the household, the lady is the one who
is the symbol of that Lakshmi, to begin with.

400
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,110
Because she’s the one who looks after your
food, looks after your comfort, she protects

401
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:33,990
you, she nourishes you, she gives you joy.

402
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,840
And the women who cannot do that are not Gruhalakshmis.

403
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,670
They are not the…’housewife’ is a very
poor word for that.

404
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:48,560
They are the Gruhalakshmis; means they are
the goddesses of the family.

405
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,610
So, the other day we were in America.

406
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,080
I told the girls, I said, “Let us wait.

407
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,180
And what we can do: it’s all right, I am
the Mother; you can give me food if you want.

408
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,160
But I don’t mind, give the boys first, and
then the girls should eat."

409
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,560
And one of them got very angry with me.

410
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,980
She said, “Mother what is this?

411
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,090
They are dominating us!”

412
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,260
If somebody eats before or later, what is
the domination?

413
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,080
I mean, in any case you are going to eat before
or after!

414
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,520
I don’t understand the portion of domination.

415
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,690
But you are privileged!

416
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:27,050
You are privileged that you can look after
so many people!

417
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,710
What is so wrong in it?

418
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:36,350
You see the whole atmosphere is so funny that
if the men eat first, then women should feel

419
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,460
that we are put down.

420
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:44,710
It’s absurd, because it’s a privilege:
you are like a mother.

421
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,780
You are the person who has to look after them,
and you have to feed them.

422
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:54,100
It’s a privilege that a Gruhalakshmi should
do that: look after everybody, give them food

423
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,290
to eat and treat them just like their protégés
you can say, something like that.

424
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,450
It’s such a privilege.

425
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,740
It’s a sign of complete maturity.

426
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,550
Even little, little girls, you have seen,
if they are brought up properly, otherwise

427
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,580
they can be horrifying.

428
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,790
But normally little girls are very generous,
more generous than men are.

429
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,490
And they always try to make you very happy.

430
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,690
They have great sense.

431
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,280
If somebody is sitting down they’ll come
and give you food and look after you.

432
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,750
I mean, I have seen my all three granddaughters,
do that.

433
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,900
Even once a washerwoman came in the house.

434
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
They said, “You must sit on the sofa."

435
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
She said, “But no, I can’t.

436
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
I can’t sit on the sofa."

437
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,270
“No, you must sit on the sofa!” they said.

438
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:44,530
They opened the fan for her and they brought
all the things that were in the kitchen for

439
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:49,020
her to eat, now, and they brought some plate
and this and that.

440
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,610
And the elder one, I told her, “What do
you want to be?”

441
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:58,160
She said, “I can only be a nurse or an air
hostess."

442
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,590
I said, “Why?

443
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,980
Air hostess and nurse, why?”

444
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,650
“Because these are the only two professions
where one can give, isn’t it, food."

445
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,820
I mean it’s a privilege.

446
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,860
Other professions you can’t do this great
job, this noble job, of giving food.

447
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:22,980
“So that’s why I want to be either the
nurse or the air hostess."

448
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,480
And they play, I have seen these girls play,
“Now I’m the air hostess, now.

449
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,920
You must eat this!”

450
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,080
They bring food in small, little things.

451
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,300
They make their own things, “Now I’m the
air hostess,” and they’ll bring it.

452
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,730
Now, there may not be any food in it, maybe
some stones they have put, or whatever it

453
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,730
is.

454
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,730
“You must eat!

455
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,730
You must look after yourself!

456
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,730
You are thinning down.

457
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,730
You’d better."

458
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,730
Like that: so sweet.

459
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,460
And then they’ll bring some pillows, “Now
you must lie down."

460
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,690
Like the air hostesses they are working, you
see, “Ah, are you feeling cold?

461
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,530
Would you like to have a blanket or something?”

462
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,510
I said, “What game is this?”

463
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,330
“Now we are air hostesses!” (laughter)

464
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,620
It’s such a privilege, an innocent privilege.

465
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:11,830
And that’s what, if we develop, this nonsense
of a right that, “We are higher, they are

466
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,490
lower,” all this nonsense will go away.

467
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,170
Who is higher and lower?

468
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:20,210
Like some hairs are here and some are here;
are they higher or lower?

469
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,530
You can’t do without this or this!

470
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:28,990
It is an absurd idea that has come into our
heads that we are higher or lower.

471
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:36,370
So a gruhalakshmi is the one who has to be
a noble woman, has to be an example in the

472
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,370
family.

473
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:43,389
Like, if a housewife herself is a drunkard,
marries ten times, what will happen to her

474
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,389
children?

475
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,520
Just think of it, such a woman.

476
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:56,159
A woman who has no sense of chastity, no sense
of auspiciousness, no sense of protection

477
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,230
for them, what can she talk?

478
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,760
Who is she?

479
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,910
What does it matter?

480
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,030
I mean what comfort can anybody give to a
housewife?

481
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,840
She is the one who is the source of comfort;
what comfort can you give her?

482
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,980
To her the greatest comfort is that you eat
your food properly, you sleep well, you keep

483
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,580
well; that is the greatest comfort.

484
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:28,000
So this is what one has to know: that gruhalakshmi
is the woman in the family, she is the gruhalakshmi.

485
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,190
But the man should not be a wolf also.

486
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,190
A gruhalakshmi cannot marry a wolf, you must
understand.

487
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:40,300
If the man is a wolf, then he doesn’t deserve
to have a gruhalakshmi, but he can have a

488
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,910
she-wolf as his wife; that’s a good idea.

489
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,310
Then they can fight, quarrel, have all kinds
of divorces, this thing.

490
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,950
But it’s the responsibility of the gruhalakshmi,
to begin with I must tell you.

491
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,760
To keep the balance it is her duty.

492
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,190
It is not the duty of the other people in
the family.

493
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,100
It is she who keeps.

494
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,280
She doesn’t give up at any cost.

495
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,150
Of course, if he’s a wolf: all right, he
can go to the forest.

496
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,250
She’s not bothered.

497
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:14,220
But the men must understand [that] the more
you start respecting the housewife, the gruhalakshmi,

498
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:21,180
in the family, the more there is respect,
the more there will be settling of these women

499
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:28,460
in their proper places, becoming proud of
their houses and families and their own set

500
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,630
up that they have put in.

501
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,870
They’ll feel they’ll have a meaning, and
the whole society will change.

502
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:39,510
But if the men run after dirty women and cheap
and street women, then the same housewives

503
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,500
can take to that.

504
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:51,990
So that is very important, that they must
be respected, because they are gruhalakshmis.

505
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,590
That is one thing.

506
00:36:53,590 --> 00:37:00,390
The second thing is, they are also rajalakshmis.

507
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:09,460
Rajalakshmis are the goddesses who are looking
after the country.

508
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,980
Like England has a Rajalakshmi too.

509
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:20,560
Now, we say, we can say, the princess now
(Princess Diana) is, she’s a rajalakshmi.

510
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,770
She is a woman with dignity.

511
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,380
She carries herself with that bashful sweetness
and all that, she’s a rajalakshmi.

512
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,100
Our Queen is very good too.

513
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:34,250
But, we can say, other people in the same
family are funny.

514
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,480
They belong to Royal family [but] they haven’t
got that strength of character to belong to

515
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
that.

516
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,490
They have all the privileges, but they think
they have all the rights, but no duties.

517
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,140
And as that also the rajalakshmi can be very
funny.

518
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,550
Like in this country there has been curses
on curses, because of seven queens were murdered

519
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,800
in this country.

520
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,220
I mean, I can’t think of any country where
even one queen can be murdered by the king.

521
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,320
This country has a very funny curse of these
seven women who were killed like this.

522
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,700
I mean, what sort of women they must have
been, and what sort of queens they must have

523
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
been?

524
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,250
I mean, there’s nothing of a rajalakshmi.

525
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,110
A rajalakshmi is a dignified woman.

526
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,360
She is the one who is the glory of the country.

527
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,630
She has to be a glorious woman.

528
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:30,350
She has to be a woman with all the attributes
of a queen.

529
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:35,330
And that is the Rajalakshmi: is the, is the
queen, or the goddess, that is the queen;

530
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:40,180
and She resides in every country.

531
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,040
Every country has a Gruhalakshmi, and if that
is insulted, then the people suffer.

532
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:52,160
They will suffer in so many ways, like they
will have money problems, they’ll have financial

533
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,700
problems, they’ll have also have problems
of society; all kinds.

534
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:02,230
Because whatever the queen does, whatever
the king does, it is done by others; but specially

535
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,230
the queen.

536
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,780
Most of the fashions in England have come
because the queen started it.

537
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:14,100
So whatever she does, she’s so important
and she has to have that idea in her that

538
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
she’s the goddess.

539
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,050
She has to represent that goddess which resides
in every country.

540
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,380
So that is the Rajalakshmi.

541
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:29,710
Now, in countries where there is no [monarch],
in democratic countries, then all right, then

542
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,980
the first lady of the country should behave.

543
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,240
Not like the American lady (Jackie Kennedy)
who married a tycoon somewhere, an old man,

544
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
and is now a photographer!

545
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
What is this?

546
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,340
So cheap, it is so cheap!

547
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,040
She doesn’t deserve to be there.

548
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,280
There’s no dignity about her.

549
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,430
She’s competing herself with cheap street
women.

550
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,660
She should know that she is the first lady.

551
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:59,510
In the countries where there is even, say,
not democracy, and other sorts of governments

552
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,380
are there, there is also a first lady.

553
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,380
And why now these first ladies also have become
competitors and they compete there with their

554
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,580
husbands and try.

555
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,120
Wherever they have tried such a trick: Even
Bandaranaike tried these things; she failed.

556
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,670
Anywhere they tried to outwit their husbands
by this, they will failed, because God is

557
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,210
not with them.

558
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,500
They are there because they are first ladies,
and they should take all pride within themselves.

559
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,330
Even if they feel they are a little bit let
down by people, not respected.

560
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,940
But if she respects herself, nobody can be
disrespectful to her.

561
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,740
She should keep her respect and everybody
will respect her.

562
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,391
But just to punish people, if she has to behave
like this, that means she has no value of

563
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,180
her own.

564
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,740
So the first thing that one, Lakshmi, gives
you [is] the value system.

565
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,780
Your value system is corrected.

566
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,790
You evaluate yourself properly.

567
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,920
Like, you know the value of this and value
of that and value of this.

568
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,310
But the value system for a divine person is
not based on the amount of money or amount

569
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:05,570
of matter it has, but it depends on what vibrations
it has.

570
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:11,810
So the whole evaluation system changes when
you get into Divine temperament, that you

571
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,520
start seeing things.

572
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,130
What is precious is what has the maximum vibrations.

573
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:32,280
Whatever has vibrations is the precious thing
for a realised-soul, and not what is not Divine.

574
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,280
What is not Divine, we have nothing to do
with.

575
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:45,840
But you will be amazed, whatever is Divine
is all very precious, also, otherwise.

576
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,790
Like the paintings, which are done with Divinity
—means the realised-souls have done — are

577
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,790
today very expensive.

578
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,310
May not be in those days, but now, today.

579
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:59,510
Actually all the truth comes up gradually,
and people can see that clearly, that there

580
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:03,170
is something special about these things.

581
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,920
So your value system changes as your Mahalakshmi
essence starts growing and manifesting.

582
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:19,390
You stand absolutely open, and you find that
new things, new ideas, a new valuation of

583
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,380
everything starts coming to you.

584
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:34,690
Once this happens to you, know that you are
growing.

585
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,790
You must know how to judge whether you are
growing or not.

586
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:47,880
And that is how you will know that you are
growing in the right direction, if your value

587
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,010
system is improving.

588
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:54,250
Today’s day is the Lakshmi’s day.

589
00:42:54,250 --> 00:43:04,270
I bless you with all the Lakshmi’s powers.

590
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:13,670
And specially the discretion to improve your
value system: what is more valuable to you,

591
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:19,680
what is the most valuable thing to you; you
must try to revise that.

592
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:30,730
Then there is, after this day, when they worship
the first day is, they say that, that is the

593
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,890
day when Diwali was celebrated when Rama was
made the king.

594
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,790
He killed Ravana on Dashera.

595
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:40,990
And [it was] on this day that Rama was crowned,
and that’s why they celebrate it.

596
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:45,160
Now, Rama is the person — at that time He
was crowned — He represents the Benevolent

597
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
King.

598
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
And the benevolence of a king is being crowned.

599
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
So that’s why they celebrate Diwali.

600
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,290
But we have a special significance of Diwali,
it’s a very special significance, I think:

601
00:43:53,290 --> 00:44:03,130
that the light, that we see here, you will
see it always goes upward.

602
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:10,360
The fire is the element that always goes upward.

603
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:17,120
It’s always against the gravity, and it
is against all that pulls you down.

604
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,400
And the light of the Spirit is also like that,
it always takes you upward.

605
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:33,190
And the person who is a realised-soul is called
as an enlightened person, because he has the

606
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,610
light.

607
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:40,770
And the light has a capacity to give you a
full idea, to see what is what, to relate

608
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:45,910
to each other, to find out the distances,
and the differences, and to discriminate.

609
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,529
So the light represents discrimination.

610
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:58,740
And when you are enlightened, the Spirit is
enlightened: in the sense [that] Spirit is

611
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:05,310
the light, but which starts expressing itself
in the atmosphere, manifesting in the attention

612
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,610
of yours.

613
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:12,170
Now, what we have done, in Sahaja Yoga, is
nothing but this is Diwali.

614
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:19,131
First one light was enlightened, then that
light enlightened another light, and now we

615
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:20,520
have so many lights.

616
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,220
This is the Diwali that I have.

617
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,000
I enjoy this Diwali [more] than anything else.

618
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,120
Now some lights are really sometimes flickering,
I know that.

619
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Doesn’t matter.

620
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:40,740
Some lights are afraid of the wind that might
affect it, so I have to look after them.

621
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,930
In India you see this part is called as ‘achal
of the mother’, you see, where she keeps

622
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,010
her child hidden.

623
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,660
And this is where she looks after the candle
also, the light that she has kindled.

624
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:58,050
And very carefully she looks after it and
tries to see again and again if it is burning

625
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,050
or not.

626
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:07,270
And when she is sure that it is burning nicely,
then she puts it on a higher place where it

627
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,470
burns; not for itself but for others.

628
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:17,370
It enlightens others and enlightens the path
of the people who are going in the darkness.

629
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:22,890
So, for us, Sahaja Yoga today, is a Mahayoga,
because it is the Deepavali.

630
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:29,770
It’s not only one deepa of your Mother burning,
but it’s so many lights all over the world.

631
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,450
You know they have taken their light and they
are burning.

632
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:36,380
Even small children are giving Realisation.

633
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,590
It has spread to the villages now, and is
spreading slowly as the Diwali.

634
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,900
And every day we celebrate Diwali we have
more and more lights.

635
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,860
And I am sure these lights are going to grow.

636
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:57,570
Those people, who still have flickering lights,
have problems, they always have problems,

637
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,970
and they must know that their light is to
be brought in properly, into proper shape.

638
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:09,420
They must put all attention to put their lights
in order.

639
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:15,170
If your lights are ordered there cannot be
a problem, there cannot be a problem.

640
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:22,180
So the correction is also a Divine quality
in you, which should work inward, by which

641
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,830
you correct yourself.

642
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,190
And the other day I was explaining how you
don’t have to think.

643
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,190
It’s very simple.

644
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:34,010
It’s a machinery, which is a Divine machinery,
which you have found out now, within yourself.

645
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,980
Now at this time when you have got a machinery,
you don’t have to think about it.

646
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,230
Because the machinery that is Divine, is just
like any other machinery.

647
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,100
For example, you know the machinery of the
car, you don’t have to think.

648
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,710
You don’t think, “I have to put a brake,”
you just put it.

649
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,810
When you are a master driver, you just do
it, you don’t think.

650
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,810
Do you think?

651
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,950
If you start thinking, you will kill so many
people by that thinking!

652
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,850
So in the same way, if you have mastered this
machinery: if you know which one to move,

653
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:06,630
how to move, how to work it out, if you have
mastered it you don’t think about it and

654
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,630
it just works.

655
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,630
And that is what it is and we have to understand
that, after developing Mahalakshmi tattwa,

656
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:19,370
which is the main tattwa, which is the evolutionary
principle by which you have evolved.

657
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:26,110
It’s the ultimate, the Sushumna, the central
path, which is the most important.

658
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,170
If the Sushumna is not all right, then you
cannot do anything, because there is the flow,

659
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:40,890
there is the opening, which is important,
which makes you wider, which makes you deeper,

660
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,240
which makes you greater.

661
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,030
That is the path of Sushumna which must be
always kept open.

662
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:57,470
You must try to keep it open: by balancing
yourself, by this generous attitude, and by

663
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,360
seeing everything through your discretion.

664
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,690
Keep it open.

665
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,280
Keep your Sushumna open.

666
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,290
And that is the path of Mahalakshmi.

667
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:16,420
If you keep your Sushumna open there will
be no physical problems, no emotional problems,

668
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,700
and of course no spiritual problems.

669
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,910
That is how one has to understand today’s
Mahalakshmi tattwa.

670
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:29,700
Now at this position when you reach, you see:
this position is very important at Mahalakshmi’s

671
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,300
principle, is that it gives you the witness
state, no doubt.

672
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:40,510
But as I have told you before, just after
this first day’s puja of the Lakshmi, when

673
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:46,530
Rama was crowned, next day they have the second
day.

674
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:55,230
And on this second day, you see the thirteenth
day, as I told you, is the day when the Lakshmi

675
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,230
was born.

676
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,570
Fourteenth day is a horrible thing, which
I do not want to tell you much about, because

677
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,770
that is the day the Goddess had to fight all
the horrible rakshasas.

678
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:09,600
So I don’t want to talk about it much because
you know all that.

679
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,100
That is the fourteenth day.

680
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,560
Then the fifteenth day is the day when the
moon is absolutely missing from everything.

681
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:21,620
It’s absolute darkness, where you put these
lights to suggest that: there are lights now,

682
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,570
let Lakshmi come within us.

683
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,120
So there is no spot that should be left which
is dark.

684
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,410
So everywhere the Lakshmi resides, and give
us the glory of Her blessings.

685
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:42,710
Then it is the night when you have the dark
night, as you call it, amavasya.

686
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:53,190
Then the first night after that, is the first
moon that the, you say the new moon.

687
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,530
[When] the new moon comes up, the first day,
is the day when the New Year starts for Shalivahana.

688
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:04,890
As you know, Shalivahanas are my ancestors,
or whatever you call it, the same Dynasty.

689
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,990
That is the day.

690
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:16,830
That day, they take a shawl, shawl of the
Mother, like this, and put this water carrier

691
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,200
on top, to suggest the Aquarius time.

692
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,550
The Aquarius time has started according to
them.

693
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:29,490
They put that on top of that, and put it,
like a flag, on top of their houses to suggest

694
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,330
now the Aquarius time is there.

695
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:36,560
With the Mother’s shawl they made the flag.

696
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:43,900
And on top of the flag is the water carrier,
is put upside down to suggest that the Aquarius

697
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:50,360
time has started, that the time of Kundalini
has started, and that this awakening has to

698
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,550
take place.

699
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:56,520
That’s the first day of the year they start.

700
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:02,970
Then after that, the second day is..so it
is five days actually; but why I said four

701
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:07,210
days celebration is because one day is a horrid
day in between.

702
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:12,220
But also there’s a celebration because,
after killing all these rakshasas, there were

703
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,220
Diwali.

704
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,950
Many a times these things happened, and every
time She killed all these rakshasas they celebrated

705
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,330
it by putting lights all around.

706
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:28,180
So after that is the second day, is very important,
which is here: is the brother and sister’s

707
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,210
special day, where the sister invites the
brother to her house for food.

708
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,740
And if he’s a small boy she will give him
a bath.

709
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:44,630
Even if he is a big boy he sits with all his
clothes on and she puts water on him and puts

710
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:47,590
something, very fragrant things, on his body
and gives him a bath nicely and gives him

711
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,590
a protection.

712
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:58,060
It’s a purity of relationship between 
a sister and a brother.

713
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:04,890
And then the brother gives her something as
a present at that time.

714
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,840
And he may give anything: it’s just symbolic.

715
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:15,920
It’s the love and affection of a brother
and sister [which] is expressed at that time.

716
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,090
It’s very important.

717
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:21,510
And then the sister, actually gives him a
bandhan, with actual light, which we call

718
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,440
as the aarti they do for the brother.

719
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
And that’s how they try to give a big protection
to their brother.

720
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,420
So this is the day, they call it in Marathi
‘Bhaubeej’ or ‘Bhaiyadweej’: that

721
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,420
is the dwitya, the second day of the moon.

722
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,650
That is done in India.

723
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:41,930
Now it has significance because it is very
important that our relationship as a brother

724
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:47,100
and a sister must be strengthened, must be
purified, must be looked after.

725
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:52,000
In India, even if somebody calls you a sister
or a brother, then he is a sister or a brother.

726
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It’s a very difficult situation.

727
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,410
If somebody calls you a sister, then you have
to accept that situation.

728
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:02,550
And if you accept that situation, all your
life you have to carry on that relationship

729
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,550
of that nobility.

730
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,810
Whether he may be your brother or not, doesn’t
matter.

731
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,900
She may your sister or not, does not matter.

732
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,600
But once you have said she is your sister,
then all that purity is there, all her chastity

733
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,890
is to be protected, and she is to be looked
after.

734
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:19,270
So this is how it is.

735
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,290
These are the five days they celebrate.

736
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,560
In short I have told you, how we Sahaja yogis
should understand, these five days are days

737
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:32,790
of real festival for us because we have overcome
death now, we have overcome that degradation

738
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,640
that would have followed after it.

739
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,820
Now we are people who are victorious.

740
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:47,140
So this is to celebrate our victory over evil,
our victory over our weaknesses, and our victory

741
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:53,560
towards the goal of our achievement — that
is full Self-realisation.

742
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,900
And that’s how it’s a great day of celebration,
and may God bless you all.

743
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:04,670
And in this jubilation I join you all, and
I am very happy that we are so many today

744
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:14,770
in this country, and a day will come when
we, our righteousness and our greatness will

745
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:28,470
definitely enhance the path of darkness with
this light, and improve the conditions, to

746
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,990
such an extent that people won’t believe
that they were living in this wretched world,

747
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,990
and today they are in such a beautiful world.

748
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,990
They won’t believe.

749
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,990
It will happen.

750
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:33,990
As it has happened within yourself it will
happen without.

751
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,040
And that’s what is the day I am waiting
for, when such things will happen.

752
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,400
And all these things we are doing here, leading
a very righteous and a good life now, with

753
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,130
forgiveness for others and with all the generosity:
it will became a universal truth for people.

754
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:50,240
And when this will become a universal happening,
and when people will universally accept Sahaja

755
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,910
Yoga, then will be the real days of Diwali’s
celebration.

756
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,480
May God bless you all.

757
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,680
So I must say, for Christmas I won’t be
here.

758
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
I’ll be in India.

759
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,630
It’s nice way, you know, because I’ll
escape all your presents! (laughter) You gave

760
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:11,220
me so many presents last time that it was
too much for me.

761
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:29,070
Of course if you say that, I gave you, because
that’s of course is nothing great because,

762
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:37,070
you see, if you give to one person, it is
too much to carry.

763
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:47,030
They say you have to have a shipload.

764
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:51,520
And if one person gives to so many, it’s
not such a difficult thing, isn’t it.

765
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,450
But if everybody gives to one person it’s
too much.

766
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:59,630
And if one person gives to many it’s very
good because the load is lessened on everyone

767
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,140
and also shared, of that one person.

768
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:08,850
So my giving was a better thing than your
giving to me, because I was really thinking

769
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:16,630
of taking a ship, to put all the nice presents
you gave me.

770
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:32,130
So, do you have any questions?

771
00:57:32,130 --> 00:58:14,020
So, now, just, this is your ring.

772
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:27,100
Kay, here’s the ring.

773
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,880
Simon, come along!

774
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:39,500
So, you see, today’s puja is more sort of
asking for the expansion, expansion of your

775
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,530
Sushumna; more that.

776
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:50,960
So as it is, when we are doing this puja,
first of all you must develop a mood of forgiving

777
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,950
others, and forgiving yourself also; just
that mood, first of all, to improve your Sushumna

778
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,770
further to grow, first of all.

779
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:06,260
So there’s a mantra for that, “Ya Devi
Sarvabhuteshu kshama rupena samsthitah."

780
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,600
All right?

781
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,280
And, “Shanti ripen samstitah."

782
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:22,920
All these mantras, if you say, all of you,
if you say these mantras: one you can say

783
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,220
and they can repeat you.

784
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:35,900
And then that will definitely improve.

785
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,140
These are all mantras for the Sushumna.

786
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:50,740
I think you people don’t have any machine,
a grinding machine in the thing.

787
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,740
So I had better pay for that machine.

788
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,920
Because I would like to give some present
to the ashram.

789
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,930
And what do you call that machine for grinding
something?

790
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,960
Yogi: A grinder, Shri Mataji.

791
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,410
Shri Mataji: Become something greater and
higher.

792
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:00,990
That’s the point is.
