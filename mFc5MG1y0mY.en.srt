1
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,767
Today we have all gathered here for 
worshipping your Guru.

2
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:48,230
As you know that the principle of Guru 
resides in the Void.

3
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:56,546
This is the principle which gives you 
balance,

4
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:04,358
which gives you the gravity.

5
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:13,765
The gravity that we have in the Mother 
Earth

6
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:24,161
is expressed through your Guru principle.

7
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:33,485
The first point of gravity is

8
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:44,633
that you should have a personality, 
a character and a temperament

9
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:59,461
that people would see that you are 
a personality

10
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:06,685
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly 
things.

11
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:21,065
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined 
by the skirmishes of life.

12
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:32,364
Is the personality of a Guru which sits 
down deep into his -

13
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:51,517
into his being and is not easily disturbed 
or dissolved by

14
00:02:58,126 --> 00:03:10,114
any solvent what-so-ever. This is the first 
principle of the Guru, is the gravity.

15
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:16,567
As I told you, it is something which cannot 
be dissolved into anything.

16
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:22,472
It settles very deep down into your 
personality.

17
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:27,089
So it doesn’t float in the water.

18
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:35,398
Now you see, in the countries which are 
developed very much

19
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:48,798
we think that we have a very great power 
of individual attainment.

20
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:58,628
That individually we are absolutely free, 
we can do whatever we like

21
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:05,896
and that’s why individual freedom becomes 
the goal of all democratic countries,

22
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:12,752
neglecting the collective. Of course, 
individual is important,

23
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:17,344
and it has to become all right to nourish 
the collective.

24
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:24,026
But if the individual does not have 
the gravity,

25
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:34,378
then they float on the surface and anything 
can impress them.

26
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:40,583
That’s why we find today people get 
impressed by fashions.

27
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:51,302
By fashions, which by no logical reason are 
good for your health, for your wisdom.

28
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,799
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

29
00:04:54,356 --> 00:05:04,831
No fashion is good for your health, nor for 
your development as a personality.

30
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:11,010
Sometimes you look so odd with it, 
so funny, so stupid.

31
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:16,099
Then this, ask your question, “What’s 
wrong in becoming stupid?

32
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,454
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

33
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:28,778
The reason is, you have an individual 
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

34
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,978
You personality is zero. You have no 
personality left.

35
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,638
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

36
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,833
Whatever is the fashion you just run after 
that.

37
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:49,113
Is this situation of the Western countries, 
but in the countries like India now

38
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:54,302
there are also in some sort of a craze.

39
00:05:54,524 --> 00:06:02,596
Because they have to still pass through 
this so-called affluence that you have.

40
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,672
So they'll take to the crazes, like 
supposing

41
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:09,006
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with 
someone,

42
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:12,090
then all rush to buy that carpet.

43
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:16,959
They’ll do anything for getting things 
to themselves.

44
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,996
So they turn towards materialism also 
in the same way

45
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:25,408
as you people turn to fashions.

46
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:34,602
The individuality is all right up to 
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

47
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:41,917
Especially in the west the personality is 
so low, is so missing

48
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:49,772
that any entrepreneur can develop any 
craze, any name

49
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:53,326
and everybody runs after that and is 
impressed.

50
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:57,935
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by 
some name,

51
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:05,337
say, he can call his… by some funny name - 
now, say "Poison", as he says.

52
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,124
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very 
great thing.

53
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:16,139
Because it is by some stupid man who has 
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

54
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,200
It is nothing special about it. It is 
nothing special,

55
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:29,765
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing 
that will make you something great.

56
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:34,577
But people will buy that particular make, 
because it has a brand

57
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:40,298
which everybody will accept. “Oh! 
It’s from that particular brand.”

58
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:44,780
And it’s such a madness about it.

59
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:49,704
Then comes to the anything from hair style, 
up to your foot style,

60
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:54,199
to your neck style, to your nail style, 
to your eyebrow style.

61
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,321
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you 
could do to your body is available

62
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:04,571
and people take to it because they have 
no gravity in them.

63
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,409
The persons who have gravity do not take 
to such changes.

64
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,948
First logically, they’ll try to know if 
this change is good or not.

65
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,455
But only because it’s a change, it's 
a craze,

66
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,800
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

67
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:31,120
This is one of the signs of gravity in 
a person

68
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:39,189
that he doesn’t float on the ground like 
straws.

69
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,403
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful 
pearl

70
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:52,477
in the deep shores of understanding.

71
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:58,621
So those who are today here to worship 
the Guru,

72
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:01,919
they have to worship their own Guru within 
themselves

73
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,212
and have to understand that first thing 
and foremost thing is

74
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:10,793
that we must have gravity in temperament.

75
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:15,820
You do not need education for that, 
university education.

76
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:21,514
You need not read books, you need not 
do anything.

77
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,304
Only thing is that you have to have your 
value system corrected.

78
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,485
When your value system is corrected, you 
understand

79
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:41,702
what is good for the society, what is good 
for you.

80
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:49,189
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it 
will never emit filth and dirt.

81
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,401
The fragrance will be always there; if it 
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

82
00:09:55,602 --> 00:10:00,270
it will emit fragrance only.

83
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:05,123
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

84
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:10,184
Now those who think they are Gurus and have 
achieved that gravity

85
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:18,764
will never write something which is ugly, 
say something which is dirty,

86
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:29,987
will never use their mind to appreciate 
anything that is filthy and wrong.

87
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:37,667
This is the second sign of your value 
system.

88
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:45,721
In your value system you have to first 
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

89
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,578
what is Divine beauty,

90
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:57,325
and what is morality of the Spirit.

91
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:04,422
These three things are to be realized and 
are to be part and parcel of your being

92
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:11,537
so that when people see you, they should 
say, “Here is a person we can see

93
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:19,393
who has that gravity, here is the person 
who has that beauty.”

94
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:23,319
It acts inside, outside.

95
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,646
A person who has that sobriety inside 
dresses up in a sober way.

96
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:37,112
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or 
just to show off or to hide something

97
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:44,269
or to expose something. But just to respect 
his body, he dresses up.

98
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,199
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

99
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,621
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless 
things

100
00:11:54,822 --> 00:12:03,439
and things which are of very baser level.

101
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:17,386
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has 
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

102
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:23,512
Like a person tries to become an expert.

103
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:33,038
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be 
an expert in his work,

104
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:38,651
like supposing, there is a person who is 
an engineer.

105
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:43,727
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care 
for fame,

106
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:48,049
he doesn’t care for applauses 
from others.

107
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:55,295
What he cares is, does he really understand 
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

108
00:12:55,496 --> 00:13:02,927
Musician has to be perfectly a musician. 
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

109
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:09,192
He does not use the general methods 
of expertise,

110
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:15,528
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit 
he tries to improve.

111
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:23,039
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve 
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

112
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,735
but not on the level of money, because 
normally people would write things

113
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:33,335
just to please the majority of the people, 
so they can sell their books

114
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:38,296
or something filthy which is not benevolent 
to the society,

115
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:44,117
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t 
mind, they become shameless about it.

116
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:51,698
So not that the Guru himself has the value 
system, but through his life style,

117
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,409
through his own preachings, through his 
own behavior

118
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:06,802
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates 
gravity to others.

119
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:14,867
So it builds up our value system, value 
system of a balance.

120
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:19,719
But it does not mean that if somebody wants 
to become an expert on one subject

121
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,758
then he neglects the other side. 
It’s in balance,

122
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:28,659
it has to be in balance, a person say, 
for example, who is a musician

123
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:37,553
and cannot understand a painting – he is 
not an artist.

124
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,528
Supposing you are an artist and still you 
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

125
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:45,801
then you are not a Yogi.

126
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:54,028
So if you start from the central point of 
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

127
00:14:54,353 --> 00:15:02,677
the knowledge that you receive or whatever 
you give is absolutely integrated

128
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:06,927
and radiates from one point.

129
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:16,704
So, in every way you become an expert, in 
any subject you become an expert.

130
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:20,996
Anybody asks you a question, you know 
everything.

131
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:28,287
But in that you know what is worthless and 
what is of worth.

132
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:35,029
You try to understand what is important.

133
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,388
You know, you give up whatever is worthless 
and you would not like to know

134
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,551
the names of different alcohols. You don’t 
want to be expert in that.

135
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:52,346
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing 
all the names of all the carpet styles.

136
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:57,232
You may not like to know all the varieties 
of sarees.

137
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,389
You may not like to know all the names of 
all the cameras.

138
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,625
You may know, but need not feel that you 
do not.

139
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:16,407
But whatever is important for the gravity 
of a personality, you will know.

140
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:24,229
So if you want to make it simple, we can 
know about auspiciousness.

141
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:31,516
What is auspicious? You’ll know about 
fair play.

142
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,646
What is a fair play towards others.

143
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:41,004
You’ll know about what is justice in 
the eyes of God.

144
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:49,264
You’ll know about the Divine music that 
elevates your Kundalini.

145
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:56,002
So as a result of this gravity you get 
discrimination.

146
00:16:56,405 --> 00:17:03,012
That you know what is your personality and 
what is the water surrounding you.

147
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:07,730
You know how to discriminate and this 
discrimination

148
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:14,782
is also actually innately comes from your 
Guru principle.

149
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:20,761
But once this Guru principle goes into

150
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:27,830
a bizarre state or into some sort of 
a turmoil or confusion,

151
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:32,821
by so many other things like you have 
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

152
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:40,502
you have false ideas, you follow false 
doctrines, you follow false theories

153
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:49,202
or you follow false books, then this goes 
bizarre.

154
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:57,805
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha 
Rudra on top of your head.

155
00:17:58,006 --> 00:18:07,384
Also in case, when you have problems

156
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:14,293
of not temperant and moderate life, if you 
are an extremist,

157
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:21,076
if you work too hard or you don’t work 
at all or if you only go on

158
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:27,028
projecting yourself into one side and not 
paying attention

159
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:30,496
to the other side of your life,

160
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:35,936
with all these imbalances, physical, 
mental, emotional and spiritual,

161
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:40,511
you develop problems of your Guru 
principle, as a result, you develop

162
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:46,125
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning 
of your destruction.

163
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:50,905
So how important it is to look after your 
Guru principle, you can see

164
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:57,229
that most of the diseases are caused by 
this principle, when neglected

165
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,432
and ultimately they reach its high – their 
heights,

166
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:06,324
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha 
Rudra.

167
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,261
Now as realized souls you have crossed 
the limit,

168
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:18,106
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you 
have transcended all those things

169
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:24,691
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not 
mean that you have developed that gravity.

170
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:31,899
You have now achieved a state.

171
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:42,182
If a flower is there and you put the flower 
on the water it will float.

172
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:48,950
But when it becomes the fruit and matures, 
then you put it in the water,

173
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:54,486
it does not float, it goes deep down, it 
doesn’t get dissolved.

174
00:19:54,687 --> 00:20:01,294
It keeps its own identity. That is what is 
to be done now

175
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:09,686
that you have to become the fruits of 
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:14,020
Blossom time is over now, you have 
to become fruits

177
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:21,203
and people who see you should know 
that you have no imbalances at all.

178
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:29,199
You are the people with special gravity. 
So when you talk to people –

179
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,562
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga 
program,

180
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:41,595
you do not behave in a childish manner or 
stupid manner.

181
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:48,979
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising 
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

182
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:56,869
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid. 
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

183
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:04,603
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior 
or behavior without gravity.

184
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:11,556
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you 
have the same style as you had before,

185
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:17,229
then you have to grow, mature, you have 
to become still the fruit.

186
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:27,300
And that is the sign that you become really 
the Guru principle people.

187
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:38,273
It is important that we have to know 
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

188
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:43,482
How she revolves with such a tremendous 
speed

189
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:47,990
holding all of us together to her heart and 
then

190
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:54,203
she emits her beautiful Divine love through 
the various beauties

191
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:59,823
that are surrounding us, now we can see 
for ourselves.

192
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:04,622
Specially when I see the big mountains,

193
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:12,400
I feel they are like great saints sitting 
and meditating here.

194
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:20,026
But they are the only ones who can catch 
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

195
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:29,089
As you know the sea is the Guru principle, 
and they are so high

196
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:35,049
that they can catch the Guru principle. So 
despite the fact you have that gravity,

197
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:45,017
you are people of very high standards. And 
you are beyond any temptations,

198
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:53,850
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can 
pervert or spoil others.

199
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:01,500
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts, 
as we had very great people on this earth,

200
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:06,424
I have given you the names and we said that 
there have been ten Gurus,

201
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:13,315
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius, 
we had Socrates

202
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:17,399
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

203
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,225
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten 
great Gurus.

204
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:27,728
Now we have so many here sitting down, they 
are all Gurus

205
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,391
and they have to behave like Gurus and 
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

206
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:39,429
And this is what today we have to see if we 
can develop that gravity within ourselves

207
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:48,434
and understanding within ourselves. When 
that peace resides within you,

208
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:55,642
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be 
really felt,

209
00:23:55,843 --> 00:24:01,658
will be really understood and will be 
enjoyed by all of you.

210
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,416
May God bless you all!
