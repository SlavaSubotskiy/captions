1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Today we are going to celebrate the Puja of Lakshmi

2
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,960
And I've already told you that

3
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,240
Lakshmi came out of the sea.

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,480
And Greece is the Nabhi of the universe.

5
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,720
And whatever Lakshmi they have got, wealth,

6
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,480
they have got it out of the sea faring activities there.

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,720
So it is very apt that we should worship Lakshmi in Greece

8
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,320
and understand what is the significance of Lakshmi is.

9
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Can you hear me there, all of you?

10
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,480
Now I've described many a time,

11
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,080
but, again I will describe it to you.

12
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Lakshmi is the one who is a Mother by nature.

13
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,960
So a person who has Lakshmi, a person who has got wealth

14
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,320
must have a motherly

15
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,240
benevolent temperament; that's one thing.

16
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Then another thing is that She stands on the lotus in the water.

17
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,240
So a person who has got Lakshmi must have a balance.

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,720
If he moves this side or that side, left or right side

19
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,320
he immediately goes inside the bhavasagar.

20
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Secondly, Her one hand is giving

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,080
and another hand there is protection like this.

22
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,400
So, at least a person who has got Lakshmi money

23
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,560
should be generous, he should be giving

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,160
and right hand should protect all the people

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,320
who are working under him or who are related to him,

26
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,720
his relations or other things

27
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,800
or any other organizations or anything that he is connected with

28
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,720
he should try to patronize and protect it from all kinds of dangers.

29
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,800
The second part is that

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,960
one hand of the Lakshmi has got a book in Her hand,

31
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,080
and another has,

32
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,720
no, second part is the

33
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,880
two hands of the Lakshmi which are on top of head

34
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
have got two lotuses in Her hand.

35
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,400
That shows a person who is rich

36
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,320
should have a heart like a lotus.

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,560
A lotus heart is like this that even a very

38
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,960
thorny type of an insect comes to the lotus in the night to sleep,

39
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,240
the lotus opens its own petals and allows that

40
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,800
thorny type of an insect to sleep

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,240
in the very cozy way on the corona of the lotus

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,160
so that he sleeps well there, comfort him.

43
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,560
In the same way, a person who is very rich should have a capacity

44
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,160
to

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,240
allow guests to come in his house

46
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,160
and to see to the comfort of the guests;

47
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,960
whatever may be the status of that guest,

48
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,240
whatever may be the situation of that guest,

49
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,240
but that is immaterial.

50
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,160
What is important is that he's your guest

51
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
and you have to look after that guest

52
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,160
and whatever he asked for you must provide him.

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,080
Of course in the modern times it's all vanished into thin air.

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,160
But we have so many examples in India

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,080
where once a guest came like that

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
and asked that he would like to eat the flesh

57
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,080
of the child of the king.

58
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,080
So the king said all right you can have the flesh,

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,160
and he cooked the flesh

60
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,560
and gave it to the guest. And guest was nobody else but

61
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,720
it was Shri Krishna. You can say Shri Vishnu.

62
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,960
And after five minutes he called the name of the boy

63
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,960
and the boy came running to the parents.

64
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,800
There are so many stories.

65
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,080
Another one is Harishchandra who had a guest who came

66
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,800
as Vamana. It's again Shri Vishnu to take his test.

67
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,000
And he asked

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,080
for all his kingdom.

69
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,080
So Harishchandra gave him all his kingdom

70
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,640
and went into the forest with his wife and suffered a lot.

71
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,240
But in that sufferings he got his moksha

72
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,160
and he got again complete reward

73
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,320
of his kingdom and everything. He is very much purified.

74
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,960
And also there is a king

75
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,320
of this coming to a king

76
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,720
Shri Vishnu as Vamana.

77
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,800
and he asked

78
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
that you have to give me land

79
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,240
which is measured by my three steps.

80
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Bali was the king. He said: "All right, whatever you say".

81
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,960
So with one foot he touched the sky;

82
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,400
with another foot he touched the Mother Earth.

83
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,560
The third foot he put on Bali's head and put him in the pathala,

84
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,240
in the lower world.

85
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,480
And that's how Vamana Avathara came.

86
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,960
And like that we have various such examples in India.

87
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,880
that when the guests are there how we are to treat them

88
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,240
and how we have to be absolutely subservient

89
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,320
and absolutely looking after.

90
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,720
And it should be an honor for us to see our Sahaj Culture.

91
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,480
This is our Sahaj Culture is.

92
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,800
But what I find, that in the modern times,

93
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,400
people just don't like this because people have become very selfish.

94
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,160
But it is always reciprocal.

95
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,800
If you have guests in your house and you look after them

96
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,320
then it is always rewarded back, always

97
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
in so many ways.

98
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,400
In My own lifetime I have seen that

99
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,080
even slightest help you give to someone

100
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,720
how it comes back to you in a very big way.

101
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,080
For example, there were..

102
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,880
Lenin can't you sit properly? Is it Lenin?

103
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,640
Whose child?

104
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Are you not Sahaja Yogis?

105
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Whose child is this one?

106
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,400
She's a new Sahaja Yogini?

107
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Now if the children misbehave,  we'll ask them to go out of Puja,

108
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
all right?

109
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
Children must behave themselves and sit quietly, all of you.

110
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,800
So once I was sitting outside my house and

111
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,640
I was knitting something in Delhi

112
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,080
and three people came

113
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,880
and they said that, "We have no place to go to, we are refugees,

114
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,480
and you have such a big house, you can give us a room,

115
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
we would be very thankful".

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,400
And I had house which had a room which was just outside,

117
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,320
it was in no way connected to the house.

118
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,480
So I said: "All right, doesn't matter. You can stay with us.

119
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,800
The vibrations you are giving - nice people

120
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,720
you are not telling lies.

121
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,160
In the evening My brother came and My husband came

122
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,960
and both of them said, now what sort of people these are,

123
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,320
God knows, and what will they  do to us, this and that, very angry.

124
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,800
I said, now I've given them the house, all right.

125
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,640
It is my responsibility.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,720
One month they were very much worried.

127
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,640
They cannot come inside the house. They are outside.

128
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,240
"What is the harm, they are refugees, let them stay."

129
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,480
They stayed on.

130
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,560
Actually they were very talented people.

131
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,960
And then there was one Muslim man. And there were riots.

132
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,560
After this whole trouble there was a riot,

133
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,800
really of a very bad nature.

134
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,720
And all these Sikh people came to my house,

135
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,080
and they said we have heard there's Muslims stay here.

136
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
I told them there is none.

137
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,960
They said: "How can you say that?"

138
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
I said: "You see I am wearing such big bindhi; I am myself a Hindu.

139
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,640
Why will I keep a Muslim in my house?

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
You get away from here. If you have to

141
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,400
misbehave then I'll call the police."

142
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
So this man was saved you see

143
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,640
and after that what happened that I just lost them;

144
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,480
they went away, they got some jobs.

145
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,080
Then the lady who came, became a very great actress.

146
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,960
And the man, the Muslim gentleman

147
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,400
who was a poet [Shahid Udyami?]

148
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,800
He was a great poet and

149
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,800
after many years, see, we wanted to make a film

150
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,800
and they wanted this lady to become mother in that film.

151
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
I said I will not ask her.

152
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
She doesn't know Me that I am here,

153
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,080
and otherwise she will have to agree

154
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,800
because she'll feel obliged to Me.

155
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I just don't want to say anything.

156
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,560
If you want you can approach her and don't tell her my name.

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,160
So, when they went to her she said

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,480
"No, no I can't do it", and this and that, you know.

159
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,400
So, they said all right you come to the opening ceremony

160
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,400
then we'll see you if like it or not.

161
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,240
She was saying: "I need a sari, you have to give me a sari",

162
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,320
this, that and all those things she was demanding

163
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
and so much money.

164
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,160
So she came for the opening of that film.

165
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,560
She saw me sitting,

166
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,640
she just came to me hugged me and started crying.

167
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,640
"How are you here? What are you doing here?

168
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,640
After such a long time I am meeting you here.", this and that.

169
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,880
They told that, "She's the one who wants to make this film.”

170
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,640
"Oh My God!", she said, " You didn't tell me.

171
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,640
What a sin I've committed.

172
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
I would give my life for this lady.”, and all,

173
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,480
and they were so surprised, and that's how the film was made.

174
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,320
So small things you do good to somebody you see

175
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
it comes out in many ways.

176
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,880
Even if you are kind to people who are supposed to be

177
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,720
not so good people say I think it works

178
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,560
Like Me I was... one boy was very badly hurt: here,

179
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
bandage here, bandage here and bandage there,

180
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,320
standing there and he told Me that, “I have no work,

181
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
can I come and work with You?”  I said: “all right, come along”.

182
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,480
So I put him in the car and brought him home.

183
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,400
So as usual My brother and My husband got very angry with Me.

184
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,800
"Who is this one you brought in? Who is he?

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,640
After all...", this and that.

186
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,880
I said: "It's all right, I'll treat him, I will put him right,

187
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,320
then it's all right.

188
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,800
I was treating him, they said: "You must go to the police,

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
you must send him to the police.

190
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,640
Might be, he might have run away from police.", whatever.

191
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
It happened about 8 days that he got cured.

192
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
I said: "Let him get cured and then leave". He was much better;

193
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,160
and that day at night he ran away from the house.

194
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,640
Because they were forcing him to go.

195
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,640
And he took away all My husband's money, his coats, and suits

196
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,800
and My brother's everything that he had

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,240
and My ornaments were lying there he didn't touch anything.

198
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,320
In the morning these two got up,

199
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,160
this your nephew has run away?  I said "Yes, but what?"

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,800
"He's run away with all our things; our shoes, our coats and pants

201
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,480
and your things he has not touched." Even My ornaments,

202
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,320
gold ornaments were lying on the table, he didn't touch anything.

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,240
I said: "This is the thing you must learn.

204
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,720
Why were you after his life? After all he was doing well,

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,160
you were after his life."

206
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,960
So he has to prove that he has, you go to the police.

207
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,320
But, this is the way you are going to do it.

208
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,880
So many things like this happen in life.

209
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,240
It's so interesting to see how and

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,240
you suddenly come across somebody and

211
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,720
they tell you, "Oh you don't remember?

212
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,800
I have been this and I have been that, You have helped me so much."

213
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,160
So always if you are generous,

214
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,800
you are always fed back by someone.

215
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Like if you open one door breeze won't come.

216
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,560
If you open the second door the breeze starts coming in.

217
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,080
So this is one of the qualities of the person who is a Lakshmipathi,

218
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,320
the one who has money to give and to protect.

219
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
Now most of the people who are rich people

220
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,960
are extremely harsh with their servants,

221
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,080
the people who depend on them, very aggressive and

222
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,720
start trying to torture.

223
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,160
But in the long run it doesn't pay.

224
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,640
I have seen it. See if you try to be very careful,

225
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,400
like in My house, my servants will never leave me.

226
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,400
I mean, I don't know, everybody used to say:

227
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,160
"Our servant has run away",

228
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,240
somebody would say, doesn't want to stay and

229
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
we have had three servants, five servants.

230
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,080
If I had one servant he would last me

231
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,640
till I actually died like that.

232
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,480
I used to wonder what is the problem with these people.

233
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,240
Actually, in the beginning they would come,

234
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,720
they would be very hungry, I would leave everything open to them.

235
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
Eat as much as you like.

236
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
They used to eat everything and they would feel very much satisfied.

237
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
Then Oh! It's too much.

238
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,640
And whatever you may leave in the fridge, anybody would not eat it.

239
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,080
So everything used to be open in my house. Never closed.

240
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,720
They wanted to eat rice they can eat.

241
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,160
Whatever they wanted to do they can do.

242
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,960
And then they became part and parcel of the household and

243
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,400
they started looking after everything very well.

244
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,400
They would never steal anything, never eat anything like that,

245
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,080
and no problems. While others lock everything,

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,160
even the salt they would lock.

247
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,080
And count everything and very strict with the servant

248
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,800
and their servants would run away after 3 days or 4 days.

249
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
And they would have servants problems. I never had, anywhere.

250
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,800
So this is it that one has to understand that

251
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,880
how you,

252
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
those people who are your near and dear,

253
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,240
how you treat them, your neighbors, your friends,

254
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,400
those people who are dependent on you. Now somebody dependent on you

255
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,720
then people try to show down that person.

256
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
All the time show in a way

257
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
that the person feels very much humiliated.

258
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,800
Then when he gets out of that house, he takes a revenge.

259
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
And he ill-treats them.

260
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,720
So this protection has to be there.

261
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Now She's standing on a lotus, means

262
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,240
on something that is very beautifully made but very delicate.

263
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,160
So She handles people very delicately.

264
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,000
And on a balance She is.

265
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,560
Now when people have money, they go into imbalances very easily.

266
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,240
You give somebody some money,

267
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,240
immediately he will go to a pub, get drunk,

268
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
will have five, six women around him

269
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,400
or if she's a woman,

270
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,240
she'll run after men and do all kinds of things.

271
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,080
So money is very

272
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,800
very, I should say, a very dangerous thing,

273
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,560
because, it gives you imbalance. It gives you terrible imbalance.

274
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,560
If you have money, too much money,

275
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,560
then you work through to such imbalances

276
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,560
that you cannot get over it.

277
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,800
And one has to be very careful.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,560
You must have seen people who have money,

279
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,160
how their children get spoiled,

280
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,720
how husband get spoiled, wife get spoiled.

281
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,480
All kinds of things are there.

282
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
So money has a very big spoiling effect.

283
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,160
And so she stands on the lotus

284
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,160
and anybody who goes into imbalances, falls into the bhavasagar.

285
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Because the Lakshmi is as you know the consort of Vishnu.

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,640
And She's

287
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,400
resides with the, on the sea.

288
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,880
So now the word ‘Marine'.

289
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,480
'Marine' has come also from the same, because we call Her 'Maria'.

290
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,720
Maria is Mahalakshmi.

291
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
She, the word comes from the marine,

292
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
because She was born out of the sea,

293
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
and that's why we call Her Maria.

294
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,960
Now this she's born, this Mahalakshmi is a higher principle.

295
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,400
When a person gets into balance and

296
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,960
behaves like a Lakshmipathi and has all

297
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,880
the affluence, he is dharmic and sensible,

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,080
then what happens that he develops another

299
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,720
principle within himself starts manifesting, is the Mahalakshmi.

300
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,240
The Mahalakshmi is the thing that you start seeking the spirit.

301
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,240
This Mahalakshmi principle is very important

302
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
and it's also the parasympathetic nervous system

303
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,560
is looked after by Mahalaksmi principle

304
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,880
and the whole of Sushumna is nothing but Mahalakshmi.

305
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,720
So when this principle is awakened within us

306
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,240
then you start seeking. They are satisfied people

307
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,080
who do not go hankering after others' things

308
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,480
do not become greedy, and we do not try to acquire the things

309
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,000
that belong to others and

310
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,240
all other kinds of illegal things we do for money

311
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,480
or these people now, this I saw the boat

312
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,240
searching out those who are smuggling drugs

313
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,400
so that it's all mad things

314
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,240
because this is no use; what will they do with so much money?

315
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,080
But, the greed goes on and on and on there's no end to it

316
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,000
That's why people do all kinds of bad things to get money.

317
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,480
But  money never gives you joy, if it had given joy

318
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,080
then people would have been happy, but they're not.

319
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,240
So the Mahalakshmi principle rises where you try to find beyond.

320
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,880
Of course the Mahalakshmi principle you do get

321
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,800
all kinds of comforts and all kinds of blessings.

322
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,800
But you get blessings also anyway but you do not hanker after it.

323
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,480
And you do not deprive people of their things

324
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,400
or sort of they do not tax them with money.

325
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,160
You are not bothered and the money runs after you.

326
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
When you are in the Mahalakshmi condition

327
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,480
then said that Lakshmi comes and fills the water in your house,

328
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,160
like that. So then there's no problem.

329
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,240
The Mahalakshmi principle is the one which gives you

330
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,480
all kinds of things which you get all as of fame

331
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,000
then also the

332
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,800
victory also success,

333
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,400
also satisfaction, dignity

334
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,480
and Aiswarya is a wealth which is dignified.

335
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,320
All this you can have if your Mahalakshmi principle is awakened.

336
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,320
And then through Mahalakshmi principle only

337
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,800
you get your realization.

338
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,160
So now in India, for example, there are three temples of

339
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,800
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswathi.

340
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,560
The Mahalakshmi temple is in Kolapur,

341
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,000
which is a swayambu means just come out of the mother earth.

342
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
And is there, the principle is there.

343
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,320
And this Mahalakshmi temple

344
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,720
there people go and sing the song of this Namadeva's,

345
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,720
which you sing ‘Jogwa' yoga pray, because only

346
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,640
in the Mahalakshmi channel, which is the Sushumna,

347
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,240
‘Ambe' is the Kundalini has to rise.

348
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
That's why they sing the song that you be

349
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,800
this... in the Mahalakshmi channel

350
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,720
let the Kundalini rise, that is Ude Ude Ambe,

351
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,640
means “Oh Kundalini you rise”.

352
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,080
But they sing it in Mahalakshmi temple.

353
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,400
Not in the temple of any other, Mahakali or any other

354
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,640
but in the temple of Mahalakshmi

355
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,640
and people didn't understand why in the temple of Mahalakshmi

356
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,240
these people go and sing.

357
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,960
Because only in the Mahalakshmi temple is,

358
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,800
in the Mahalakshmi channel,

359
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,720
this Kundalini has to rise and get awakened.

360
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Now this Mahalakshmi principle first was manifested

361
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,960
at the time of Shri Rama as Sita.

362
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Then it was manifested later on Mahalakshmi principle as

363
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,240
Radha, Ra dha. Ra means energy, dha means the one

364
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
who sustains the energy.

365
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,400
So it manifested as Radha.

366
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,960
And then it manifested as 'Maria', Christ's Mother.

367
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,640
She's Radha herself, but She created her own child.

368
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,400
As Radha created, she, you see

369
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,720
it's all described in the 'Devi Mahatmyam'

370
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,240
that Radha, how she created the form

371
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,160
and she also created her own child which is

372
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,160
our Lord Jesus Christ.

373
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,800
So this is how Mahalakshmi principle

374
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,480
manifested best in the life of Maria.

375
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,160
And then this Maria kept quiet.

376
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,160
She never said She was anything.

377
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,560
But Christ did say about Her,

378
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,240
and on the cross He said, "Behold the Mother".

379
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,240
Means the Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi...

380
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,560
should see to Mahalakshmi. The Mahalakshmi.

381
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,080
It has many meanings. It also means, "Behold the Adi Shakti".

382
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,880
It also means, "Behold the Mahalakshmi",

383
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,560
means the channel.

384
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,240
It also means that your principle of Mahalakshmi.

385
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,960
So that's what He said.

386
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,560
Because on the cross He was very much in pain,

387
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
but He said, "Behold The Mother".

388
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,800
And that is the significance that these

389
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,640
people have to look after their Mahalakshmi principle

390
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,400
and also they have to look after the

391
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,800
ascent and the Adi Shakti.

392
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,560
But this Mahalakshmi principle is there within us now awakened

393
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,640
because they are all Sahaja Yogis and Kundalini has come up.

394
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,640
But still we sometimes lose our balance.

395
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,880
We go to the left or to the right

396
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,480
There are some people in Sahaja Yoga,

397
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
came to Sahaja Yoga and were making money and all that

398
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,480
and they fell off.

399
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,080
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

400
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,240
we continue with all our nonsensical things.

401
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,640
So if you have to ascend you must know that

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,080
our Mahalakshmi principle has to be absolutely pure.

403
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,160
And that purity we must achieve

404
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,160
and we should put all our attention to our Sahasrara.

405
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,960
Because in the Sahasrara they say

406
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,880
Mahalakshmi becomes the Viratangana.

407
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,240
Is the power of the Virata.

408
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Virata means that, you can say the

409
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,960
Macrocosm. Macrocosm.

410
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,080
So in the brain She becomes the Viratangana.

411
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,080
And there She is to look after the brain.

412
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,960
So this Mahalakshmi principle that enters into the brain

413
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,160
and gives you new dimensions to your awareness.

414
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,240
And also lot of knowledge, lot of knowledge that you know

415
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,080
and you become really very dynamic.

416
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,640
So the first thing that happens to you with Mahalakshmi principle

417
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,000
that you become very intelligent

418
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,880
and you start absorbing, absorbing many things

419
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,320
which you would normally not do.

420
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,000
For example, to sing Hindi song and Marathi song is not easy.

421
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,880
But you have seen how Sahaja Yogis sing it so easily.

422
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,160
Only Sahaja Yogis can sing nobody else can sing.

423
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,880
So that shows that it gives you a new dimension.

424
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,400
Also you know about so many musicians

425
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,800
who have played before me and suddenly have become

426
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,160
very great musicians and have become

427
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,000
very well-known people in India.

428
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,960
So all the musicians in India respect Me very much

429
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,960
and they always want that I should listen to them.

430
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Also it happens in every area of our adventures.

431
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,560
Like even it helps in your business.

432
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,080
We have some business people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

433
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
now they have become tycoons.

434
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,320
So the Mahalakshmi principle acts not only on our financial side,

435
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,880
material side, also on our creative side.

436
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,400
Become very creative in our art,

437
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,480
in our expressions of our literature and all those things.

438
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,080
So this principle is the main principle we have to stick on to

439
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,000
is the Mahalakshmi principle and I'm very happy that in this day

440
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,480
we are celebrating this Lakshmi puja,

441
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,160
which ultimately has to become the Mahalakshmi puja.

442
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,160
But problem is that still the people will... are still

443
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,640
lost into these things

444
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,480
which are very dangerous and are harmful.

445
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,480
First of them is alcohol; alcohol is against Lakshmi.

446
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,880
If alcohol comes from one side they say,

447
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
the bottle comes from one door,

448
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
the Lakshmi runs away from another much faster than.

449
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
So you have seen that people who drink

450
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,480
how their families are ruined and

451
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,640
absolutely they don't have any money left.

452
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,080
Another is this what you call is gambling.

453
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,080
Gambling is absolutely against,

454
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,880
because it's a disrespect of the, it is a disrespect

455
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,720
of the Lakshmi Tattwa.

456
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,800
Because Lakshmi should not be achieved by

457
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,880
dwindling or by cheating

458
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,320
or also by some sort of a trick or a play.

459
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
That should not be done and when it is done,

460
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,320
it is not respected, so she goes away.

461
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,880
That's why a person who goes to races you'll find

462
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,400
he can never be rich.

463
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,080
Today he'll be rich, tomorrow he'll be a beggar.

464
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
So all these things are in Sahaja Yoga even people who play these

465
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
what you call share markets and stock markets and all that.

466
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,000
Is against the Lakshmi principle. It doesn't work out.

467
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,560
So the Lakshmi principle if it works out well,

468
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
you can get out of the problem of money.

469
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,720
But for that it is important

470
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,000
that you have to meditate and cleanse your Nabhis.

471
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,320
And the Nabhis are on the right side, I tell you,

472
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,800
is of course is the Raja Lakshmi

473
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,320
which is the dignity is the queen, I should say.

474
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,560
But on the left hand side is the wife, the Gruha Lakshmi.

475
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,240
And when the Gruha Lakshmi, the wives, are not sensible,

476
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,960
if they don't understand their responsibility,

477
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,560
said in Sanskrit "[SANSKRIT WORDS]":

478
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,000
where the women are respectable and respected

479
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,160
there only the Gods will reside.

480
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,480
So what happens is that

481
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,720
that when the house wives lose their dignity,

482
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,000
lose their purpose,

483
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,080
lose their aim in life,

484
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,160
also become very wayward and stupid

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
when they try to compete with men.

486
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,720
Then the society starts getting disoriented.

487
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,160
Gradually you find there is a great decline

488
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,080
and a decadence of the society as such.

489
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,160
Today we find in the west we can call it a decadent society,

490
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,560
very decadent and for that I think

491
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,960
the women of the west are responsible.

492
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,560
If women had kept their feet on the grounds,

493
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,880
it would never have become so decadent.

494
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,480
But it has happened now, it's the responsibility

495
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,720
of all the Sahaja Yoginis to be good housewives,

496
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,720
to live with dharmic [UNAUDIBLE], to be kind to others,

497
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
look after other Sahaja Yogis, I've already told them today,

498
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,560
how they treat others and they are there to preserve.

499
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,240
They are not there to dominate

500
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,880
but to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

501
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Now in this place we have here maybe

502
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,720
the 'purvajas' the 'forefathers',

503
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,400
the [Stamatis] might have been doing some very dharmic things

504
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,800
or might have been very religious people

505
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,400
or might have been very God-fearing,

506
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,560
that I could come here and we could do this Puja here.

507
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,400
So it is according to their punyas,

508
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,640
their good things which has brought this Puja here,

509
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,240
and I'm sure they all will be blessed here

510
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,480
and their souls will be happy;

511
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,320
and that they will take their birth again to get their realization.

512
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,560
So it's a very good thing to come here and

513
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,560
achieve this puja here.

514
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,480
I'm very much thankful to you all for coming down here

515
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,960
because it's little far away from Athens, but

516
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,080
such a peaceful and a beautiful place for a puja

517
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,400
and as you see today is the first moon day,

518
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,400
is a very auspicious day today and it's the

519
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,960
Lakshmi which came out on the first night

520
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,400
of the ‘Manthana' they say so.

521
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,240
So she was brought out of the sea,

522
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,560
Lakshmi was brought out of the sea.

523
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,160
And one of the fourteen things that came out of the sea,

524
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,560
one of them was the Lakshmi.

525
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,240
And Greeks understood this and they

526
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,880
worked very hard to have fleet of ships

527
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,000
and they made their money only out of shipping activities,

528
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,880
and so that shows that they had the idea

529
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,320
about Lakshmi Tattwa very well.

530
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,400
Athena was here and

531
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,960
once I went and saw the museum man here

532
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,560
and he told me that we are used to believe in Athena, in one Goddess.

533
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
But when some Indians came and told us

534
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,080
this one Goddess takes three forms.

535
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,960
These are the three forms

536
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,240
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi.

537
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
These are the three powers [...],

538
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,880
Also, they must have heard about Kundalini,

539
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,160
the way they put snake form.

540
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,160
So it is important for us to start

541
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,400
new traditions and

542
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,400
new behavior and a

543
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,720
and a new type of a society, a new race

544
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,400
that people will see and know that

545
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,240
these are the people who are really

546
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,960
working on their Mahalakshmi principle.

547
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,720
May God bless you all.

548
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,880
Children have to come up to wash My Feet.

549
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,000
All the children, all right.

550
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Come!

551
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:44,400
This is just the beginning of it, still not there.

552
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:50,320
Be careful; there's a light behind you.

553
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,560
My photograph is there, but photograph is missing.

554
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,480
Vibrations here

555
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,480
This is how what happens to people. This little light

556
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,160
passes on to them.

557
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,160
They are all Sahaja Yogis sitting.

558
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:19,880
The lines are tying up everything.

559
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,560
Mother says that the lines are tying everyone.

560
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,480
They form Omkara.

561
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:59,800
Omkar looking like heart later on.

562
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:18,640
Here the Omkara has taken the form of a heart.

563
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,880
This is Ganesha.

564
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:28,320
Here the light takes the form of Mother's name.

565
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,000
You are all become one with Me.

566
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:59,800
Mother says we all have become one with the Mother.

567
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:21,080
All other lights don't show also.

568
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,400
See how many lights from Mother and

569
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,560
other lights don't show on the photo.

570
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,960
Omkara.............. [UNAUDIBLE]

571
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:31,640
I hope you have seen My last Sahasrara's

572
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,640
where the whole [UNAUDIBLE].

573
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:50,640
All of you should see them I think. I should carry them with Me.

574
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,560
I know.. deities, once there are so many photographs.

575
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,080
Temple of Athena and Surya; too much of Surya heat.

576
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,640
Zeus.

577
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,960
So it is very good today because

578
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,720
after all Lakshmi is a......

579
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,960
Zeus is the Parashurama Avatar

580
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,320
and the Mahalakshmi.

581
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:33,000
These are the vases from Italy.

582
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,960
Hello! What is this?

583
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,880
Such a funny present it is.

584
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,880
Quite interesting. There is a door

585
01:45:57,080 --> 01:46:00,320
It has a center Nabhi and full of honey like you.

586
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:04,160
which You have been giving all the time.

587
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,400
What is this inside... is honey?

588
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:13,640
Oh a bottle of honey. There is Nabhi there.

589
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:27,240
It is beautiful. It is not funny. Very interesting.

590
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:02,480
The Finnish Yoginis baked some bread for you themselves.

591
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:06,800
But because the puja was delayed, so it got dried little bit [UNAUDIBLE]

592
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,960
Can I have?

593
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,080
It is just a symbolic gift for You, Mother.

594
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,720
I can have.

595
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,160
Very good.

596
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,320
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

597
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:04,800
What is this for water? Sharbath [SYRUPY COOL DRINK]

598
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,560
This is coral.

599
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:38,800
That she didn't know how to paint and suddenly she asked Me.

600
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,400
She didn't know how to paint she just asked My [UNAUDIBLE]

601
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,240
Spontaneously she painted this.

602
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,960
She didn't know how to paint and what to paint,

603
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:59,640
and suddenly she has the

604
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:29,320
Dolphins symbolize Shri Vishnu.

605
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:39,400
Shri Mataji!

606
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:41,800
The dolphin symbolize friendship

607
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,480
and this is from Greek, from Knossos.

608
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:47,400
Not only.... evolution

609
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:52,640
Dolphin was the first fish which came out of Mother Earth.

610
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:58,080
See Vishnu took the form of dolphin also.

611
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:10,800
No let her also hold,

612
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,800
come along, all the children have to hold it.

613
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,480
Every child has to hold it, all right.

614
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,480
It's beautiful.

615
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,400
This is from children?

616
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,640

Who is Radhika?

623
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:05,240
Beautiful Radhika!

624

You have done so well!

625
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:10,160

630
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,080
