1
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:09,475
We can say, in 1970, 5th May,

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:21,811
first time, the collective Spirit of God
opened out.

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:35,386
So far the blessings of God came to human
beings individually as grace.

4
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:42,873
And they received their Self-realisation
individually, one by one.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:59,741
And the method for individual realisation
was just the opposite of the collective.

6
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:09,044
First they had to establish their dharma,
cleanse themselves fully,

7
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:17,493
desiring all the time for their salvation,
putting their attention to their salvation,

8
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:23,397
as you call it Ishwara Pranidhan
(desire for God), thinking of God,

9
00:01:23,598 --> 00:01:30,791
asking for His grace and acting

10
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:41,784
in a scrupulous, dharmic ways to keep
themselves pure.

11
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:50,630
They had to control their mind, control
their desires,

12
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:59,621
control their action in such a manner that
they absolutely kept to the centre path.

13
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:04,969
And when they could get through all that

14
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:12,607
testing and immunity, and when they
deserved [it],

15
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:20,644
then only the grace of Mother gave
them Realisation.

16
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:26,197
This pattern was on for some time.

17
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:38,089
These few people who got Realisation

18
00:02:40,206 --> 00:02:47,027
did lots of wonderful things to prepare
for Sahaj Yoga.

19
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:53,964
They were in every field of life, but very
few and unique.

20
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,315
For example, in India and in many other
places in ancient times,

21
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:10,934
they discovered the unique gifts
of the Mother Earth;

22
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:18,444
what you call as the swayambhus – created
by themselves.

23
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:23,419
These stones or stone images,

24
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:31,661
which were thrown out by the Mother Earth,
were discovered by these saints.

25
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:36,475
They put shrines there, they worshipped
them

26
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:43,619
and, by worshipping, they made these
images vibrate -

27
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,984
more of vibrations and vibrate that area.

28
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:56,902
All over the world there are such stones,

29
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:02,633
but only the saints could discover them.

30
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:09,950
Then they established the importance
of virtue in life:

31
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:18,323
how virtue can give you health, wealth
and prosperity

32
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,093
which is glorifying

33
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:32,824
and not which is degrading or which is
destructive.

34
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:44,066
They established schools and universities,
specially in India.

35
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:53,726
And today, even today, in India, the
families which belong to one university

36
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:58,068
carry the name of that university
as their gotras.

37
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:06,144
And even today the families belonging to
one (the same) gotra cannot marry.

38
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:14,060
They prepared young children, educated
them,

39
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:18,593
in such a manner that they led a very
dharmic life,

40
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:26,984
enjoyed their married life fully and then
they matured in such a manner

41
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:38,972
that they got their realisation and lived
a life of complete enjoyment.

42
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:49,242
Thus they distracted the attention
of people which was outside,

43
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:55,608
to inner, deeper values, by their own
example,

44
00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:02,583
by their own behaviour, by their own
style of enjoyment,

45
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:07,700
by leading a very cheerful and a happy
life.

46
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:18,818
All this permeated a kind of confidence
in God, religion,

47
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:28,685
and a very good, balanced life.

48
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:44,496
They have really done a great job of first
building, the scaffoldings

49
00:06:45,640 --> 00:07:04,047
of the huge, great building of Sahaja Yoga
which is going to come now.

50
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:11,163
They are just like nuts and bolts in our
whole working.

51
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:24,980
Their desire to establish dharma was
so great

52
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:36,677
that complete Divine force of Mahakali
was working through them.

53
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:44,288
Then they put it to the action with such
understanding and such wisdom.

54
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:53,910
Great scriptures were written by them

55
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:06,649
and for many years, thousands of years,
they were the guiding lines for people.

56
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:18,038
Only in the modern times, if you say about
a thousand years or so,

57
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:28,017
people started doubting them.

58
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:39,989
Before that people used to doubt
themselves.

59
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:48,768
They used to doubt that, “We are not yet
capable. We are not good enough.

60
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:51,905
We cannot do it better, but they are
perfect.

61
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:55,442
Whatever they have said is all right.”

62
00:08:55,643 --> 00:09:01,958
There was no doubting about
the incarnations

63
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,360
or about these saints, what they said.

64
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:11,782
But the doubting was about themselves

65
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:16,019
that, “How is it that this is the good
path, we know,

66
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,508
this is the real path, we know; still we
are going in the wrong direction?”

67
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,847
If you read the poems of those days,
it’s all the time [expressing] that,

68
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:37,897
“Why, despite the desire to be good, to be
upright, to be righteous,

69
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:45,869
why am I roaming into wrong paths
and wilderness?”

70
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:55,071
The writers in those days always showed
that a good righteous man

71
00:09:55,475 --> 00:10:02,260
was rewarded by God’s blessings,

72
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:13,772
but all this started toppling down with
the ego developing

73
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:17,958
and the super-ego challenging.

74
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,320
Confusion started coming into the minds
of people

75
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:29,212
and they started doubting those great
realised souls

76
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:32,831
instead of doubting themselves.

77
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:40,687
Because they could not reach anywhere near
these great saints,

78
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:47,781
some of them were influenced by many
satanic forces around

79
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:53,625
and played into their hands and started
doubting

80
00:10:53,826 --> 00:11:00,185
those realised peopl eand all these great
scriptures.

81
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:10,383
So, [on] the one side we have the doubting
people, the another side the fanatics.

82
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:19,290
Those who tried to adhere more and more
to the teachings had to become fanatics,

83
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:23,282
so they became fanatics.

84
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:35,697
And those who started doubting also could
not show any benefits of doubting,

85
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:39,017
could not convince the fanatics that they
were wrong.

86
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:44,838
So on one side we had fanatics and another
side the doubting people -

87
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:54,298
it’s like standing between the two stools
– the real religion in man collapsed.

88
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:58,649
There cannot be a new religion.

89
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:06,077
Religion is a continuous living process
within us which is our sustenance.

90
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:15,781
It’s like a ladder on which we climb,

91
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:22,391
leaving one by one, step by step,
but not leaving the ladder.

92
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:27,095
All others are required.

93
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:39,496
So the ultimate had to be established

94
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:47,394
because of these two types of emergence,

95
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:55,721
one doubting, another fanatics.

96
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:11,229
Both had not known God, both had not
achieved Reality,

97
00:13:11,753 --> 00:13:19,413
and they criticised each other

98
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:26,047
because both of them did not know what
Truth was.

99
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:38,820
I took My birth at a point where these
confusions had started,

100
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:44,851
showing its results even on the physical
plane.

101
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:56,108
All imbalances of life react
– physically, mentally, emotionally,

102
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,803
also spiritually.

103
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:11,086
When I started looking around I was amazed

104
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:20,731
how ignorance had made people naïve,

105
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:26,696
like a cloud of ignorance which came
on them.

106
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:31,916
Formerly people had this much
understanding,

107
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:37,254
this much sensitivity to know what is
right and what is wrong.

108
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:43,268
Even if they were wrong they knew that
wrong was wrong and right was right.

109
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:49,158
But in this [world’s] confused state I was
born,

110
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:58,414
and I knew I was to open the Sahasrara.

111
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:10,189
So I started My work after My first shocks.

112
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:19,525
I decided not to talk about it to anyone
and lead a very, very normal life

113
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:23,630
of a very ordinary person,

114
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:28,738
not to be very striking.

115
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:39,940
Because, like Christ when He was born,
a star came up.

116
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:48,317
That’s how the king Herod came to know
about Him,

117
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:56,547
and his forces worked and you know
the story what happened.

118
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:06,342
If you are born with any striking signs

119
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:10,492
the negativity immediately finds you out.

120
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:20,890
As it is it found Me out and just after
the 15th day of My birth

121
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:25,625
there was a very big accident as you know.

122
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:34,643
I had to really, really work, very, very,
very hard

123
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:44,859
to enter into your being to find out
the different permutations and combination.

124
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:49,566
First of all, I had to find out your basic
problems,

125
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:53,837
what are your basic problems are.

126
00:16:54,991 --> 00:17:02,409
Once you handle the basics then you can
handle the permutations and combinations.

127
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,644
After finding the basic problems I started
finding out

128
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:11,791
your permutations and combinations

129
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:20,930
and I was amazed how human beings
were placed to their outside world

130
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:27,364
and how they reacted to their outside
world. And I identified

131
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:32,646
that these permutations and combinations
which formed within themselves

132
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:37,231
were also capped by their other
identifications,

133
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,201
like the society in which they were born,

134
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:46,638
like the nation in which they were born,
like the ideas that were there.

135
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:50,325
All these things became much more important

136
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:54,162
than the Original Being, which is
Universal, within you.

137
00:17:54,363 --> 00:18:02,137
And every individual had taken a very odd,
funny, awkward type of a shape

138
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:09,583
which I didn’t know how to reduce and how
to bring it to proper growth level

139
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:13,388
by which they start their growth.

140
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:19,602
It was a very, very hard work and
the nights after nights I used to work,

141
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:25,185
while leading a very, very ordinary life
of a very normal person.

142
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:39,731
I used to deliberately behave like a very
simple ordinary student

143
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:45,127
and show all My ignorance about things,
but sometimes, you know,

144
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:52,049
Truth has an awkward habit of slipping out
and it used to show itself.

145
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:58,746
Then this working started and one
of the biggest major problems

146
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:05,768
of human beings I found was the family life
and that’s why I married.

147
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:11,029
I wanted to study what are the problems
of family life.

148
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,558
And then I started facing these problems
as if they were My own

149
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:22,707
and started understanding why people
behave in this manner and that manner.

150
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:25,406
Because these connections are to be done,

151
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:29,906
of course by you, but much more
by the Divine Force

152
00:19:30,107 --> 00:19:36,181
and if I could know what are your problems
I would be able to act.

153
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:43,721
Then other problems like political,
economic and all these problems also

154
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:48,531
I tried to study because they became
so important for human beings,

155
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:52,240
which are of absolutely artificial value,
but they did.

156
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:57,465
So I had to see to that, what makes them do
this and what makes them do that.

157
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:06,373
Sort of a Human Behaviour Science I had
to study for years.

158
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:15,996
And then as you start unfolding or you can
say unentangling or disentangling,

159
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:24,154
or taking out the knots of a bundle,

160
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:28,564
you reach a point where all the knots
are opened out

161
00:20:28,764 --> 00:20:32,567
and one knot is still left, you see, which
is to be opened out.

162
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:39,822
And that was done on the 5th of May 1970.

163
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:47,463
And once that had [been] done,
the collective phenomena started working.

164
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:52,502
And the greatest collective phenomena was
that the Shri Chakra being on this Earth,

165
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:57,619
could be felt through your fingers.

166
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:07,654
This was never before so, nobody felt
the fingers enlightened,

167
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:12,189
nobody felt the vibrations on the fingers
as such,

168
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:15,489
but they felt it within themselves

169
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,744
because the rising of the Kundalini
and everything

170
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,602
and the way they developed themselves
inside,

171
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:31,749
they were more concerned about one
individual.

172
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,882
They developed their inner being much more
than their collective being.

173
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:45,899
But now because the Sahasrara of
the Universe was opened out,

174
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,588
everybody started feeling the vibrations
around them with their own hands.

175
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:58,126
That means the chakras themselves were
feeling before

176
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:05,898
[but] now the fingers, which are manifested

177
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:14,619
from the power of a particular chakra
or chakras, could feel the vibrations.

178
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,516
That means the sensitivity of the Divine,
which was in the chakras,

179
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,738
spread out to peripheries to such an extent

180
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:28,826
that the human being could feel it
on the fingers.

181
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:33,243
This was fantastic!

182
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:46,383
So My job was to move from the centre
to the periphery.

183
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:52,826
While moving that, whatever are
the obstacles I met,

184
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:56,632
I had to clear them out, one after another.

185
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,514
And then, once all the obstacles are
cleared out

186
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:05,176
and all the network is properly done,

187
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:15,646
then to generate the energy through this
happening of Sahasrar Day.

188
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:20,968
So you can imagine how important is
this day!

189
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:27,108
Now this much is for Myself.

190
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,905
I don’t know how many of you really know
how much the Divine had to work

191
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:40,790
and how many of you are really thankful
to the Divine for this tremendous work,

192
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:44,297
which was done through ages

193
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:50,943
and now specially for these forty seven
years of My life.

194
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:58,740
Relentlessly it worked, keeping up the
facade of a very normal, ordinary person.

195
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:07,097
Because it had to reach to the ordinary,

196
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:13,080
not to the extraordinary but to
the ordinary.

197
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,679
And one had to take out the extraordinary
qualities in the ordinary

198
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,680
by making them deeper. This was
the tremendous task.

199
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:34,619
But then I must say, that the Sahaja Yoga,
when it started working out,

200
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:46,656
I also was given very great workers,
tools of Sahaja Yoga,

201
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,314
who took it up upon themselves as their
own responsibility.

202
00:24:55,143 --> 00:25:00,122
And you all should be thankful to them
because they really worked

203
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:03,611
very hard with Me,

204
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:08,174
taking [it] up upon themselves as their
own responsibility.

205
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,789
Very few, but they did.

206
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,938
The rest of them can be divided into
many categories:

207
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,532
Some of them just came for their
own treatment

208
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:22,520
or something like that, of a very low
level. Or for their relations;

209
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:27,569
when they got realisation they got all
their sick relations to Me.

210
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,418
Then some of them came for their financial
and all sorts of mental problems.

211
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:38,996
Then some of them came for their family
and spiritual problems,

212
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:42,325
for getting rid of that.

213
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:53,496
But the ones who took it up as their
own responsibility,

214
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:58,576
that this is what they have to do, this is
their life,

215
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:04,270
this is what their complete meaning is,

216
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:09,609
they put entirely their attention to it

217
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:19,922
and they worked it out, whatever was
possible, on their own level.

218
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:28,805
So today we have to understand one thing

219
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:39,330
that we really need those brave people
and those people who feel responsible,

220
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:49,785
which is a very important virtue
of Sahaja Yogis.

221
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,765
While personal things, your own chakras
and your own problems

222
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:04,107
and all that is not important

223
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:07,080
because if the whole improves you are
going to improve too.

224
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:10,075
If the whole of the body improves you
are going to improve.

225
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:13,317
But if one finger improves [and] the rest
of the body is suffering, you see,

226
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:16,678
you are not going to be happy either.

227
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:22,103
So the main thing is what are you doing
for Sahaja Yoga?

228
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:27,728
What you can do? How far you can go?
How you are going to work it out?

229
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:33,647
In every walk of life and field of life,
those who really work it out

230
00:27:33,856 --> 00:27:37,528
as a great responsibility upon themselves,

231
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:44,780
are the ones [who] will be given more and
more powers and chances.

232
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:52,119
Then in Sahaja Yoga you will find it’s so
simple and clean, absolutely clean.

233
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,236
There is nothing hanky-panky about it.

234
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:04,641
Right from money up to the point of you
people [who] are confiding things into Me.

235
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:08,565
You have been telling Me all about you,
and I know everything about you,

236
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:16,151
which I have taken into My Ocean of Love,
and have tried to help you in every way,

237
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:20,173
outside inside, solving your problems.

238
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:28,691
It is so transparent to see how Sahaja Yoga
is so much a Mother to you.

239
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:33,767
But while taking all the advantage with it,

240
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,806
still you are more identified with your own
enjoyments

241
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:42,587
and your own idea of enjoyment.

242
00:28:43,294 --> 00:28:46,301
You people still do not enjoy that
collective Spirit

243
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:52,536
which was opened on the 5th May 1970.

244
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:59,357
You still, in companionship, in company
with each other,

245
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:08,210
you enjoy it more like people who are
not Sahaja Yogis.

246
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,410
Now today is the day to make a big
determination

247
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,578
that you will start enjoying your
collective Spirit.

248
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:25,363
Everything for the collectivity.

249
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:27,748
Then the enjoyment will be maximum.

250
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:31,822
You will never feel that you have
sacrificed anything.

251
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:36,398
But unless and until we have more
of such people,

252
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,543
the other dishwashers are of no use.

253
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:46,689
Just dishwashers or of a very low grade
Sahaja Yogis are absolutely useless,

254
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,594
who just want to take advantage and
have a nice time,

255
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:56,817
and all that type of people. They are
not going to make much mark for us.

256
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:02,654
You don’t need much intelligence for that,
you don’t need much money for that.

257
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:08,694
You don’t need anything but a complete
desire.

258
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:17,893
And one should know that, here, we are
going to gain our own flowering,

259
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:25,675
the flowering of the whole, of which we
are the part and parcel.

260
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:35,720
So you must make a determination not
to bring Sahaja Yoga to your personal level

261
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:41,592
or to your limited problems, or to your
own relationships.

262
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:51,820
It is the relationship of the Creation
with God.

263
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:56,029
It’s not your relationship or anybody
else’s relationship.

264
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,773
As in any machine, all the wires must be
connected to the mains

265
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:05,689
through one main wire, in the same way
you all must be connected to God

266
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,614
individually so that you all are connected
among yourselves.

267
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:12,389
I’ve been saying this again and again
and again

268
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:19,436
because at Sahasrara you are being blessed
of this collective Spirit.

269
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:29,152
The second very important point is of
complete integration within and without.

270
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:33,349
Within, unless and until there is
integration,

271
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,924
we cannot bring forth the outside
integration.

272
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:46,189
The complete integration within, comes
by dedicating yourself

273
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,658
to your own improvement.

274
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:59,826
First and foremost is: time must be given
for your development.

275
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:05,641
Not to show Me or not to show anyone!
It is between you and yourself.

276
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:10,910
You have to work hard to cleanse yourself.

277
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:19,460
Easy to live comfortably with all
the horrible chakras within us,

278
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:31,915
but it is easier also and the best, most
enjoyable is, to have very clean chakras.

279
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:37,360
And it comes [by], first of all,
is sincerity.

280
00:32:39,077 --> 00:32:46,417
First of all is complete sincerity.
Are we sincere to ourselves?

281
00:32:46,988 --> 00:32:51,310
Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think
if you have to be sincere to ourself

282
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:54,558
we should deny Sahaja Yoga.

283
00:32:54,759 --> 00:33:00,699
Sahaja Yoga is the union between you
and God,

284
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:08,138
and the sincerity must be full, must be
complete.

285
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:15,764
Any kind of insincerity which comes into
you is extremely detrimental.

286
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:23,308
So you must know that, as your Mother
has sincerity about you,

287
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,827
you must also have sincerity about
yourself.

288
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:34,114
Then you will start enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:39,269
That is very important to create
integration within you

290
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,332
because if it is sincerity, it comes from
your heart.

291
00:33:43,533 --> 00:33:48,067
If it is coming from your heart then your
body, your mind,

292
00:33:48,268 --> 00:33:55,420
your intelligence, everything will work
hard to fulfil it.

293
00:33:55,628 --> 00:34:01,780
But if it is not coming from your heart
it is going to be a superficial thing.

294
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:06,715
So you try to feel it from your heart.

295
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:12,435
That’s what it means: sincerity.
Do not depend on anyone –

296
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:19,722
your wife, husband, children – nothing –
mother, father. It’s your own.

297
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:26,537
So you have to work in such a way that
you get complete integration

298
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:34,301
and the driving force towards integration
is a very simple one: is sincerity.

299
00:34:37,103 --> 00:34:45,526
Thus you will know that automatically you
are getting integrated.

300
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:50,938
The another factor [which] is important
is patience.

301
00:34:51,705 --> 00:34:55,114
You must have patience with others,

302
00:34:55,315 --> 00:35:01,216
because if you do not have patience
your sincerity will start doubting itself.

303
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:05,364
So you must have patience and to get
patience

304
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:11,703
you must know what you have been so far
and where are you.

305
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:15,052
When you will know what you were, you will
have patience with others,

306
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,222
tremendous patience.

307
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:26,521
And by having patience with others your
sincerity will be all the time complete.

308
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:31,607
By your sincerity you will be completely
integrated.

309
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:36,050
So we come to the point of sincerity.

310
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:42,317
Now let us go deeper into it: how
the sincerity is to be maintained.

311
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:47,506
First of all we have to make some
determinations,

312
00:35:47,707 --> 00:35:51,205
sankalpas (vows), of being sincere.

313
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:59,532
Then we have to act by finding out how
do we get insincere on what points.

314
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:03,277
You are good at analysing [so] you can
find it out:

315
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:07,168
how do you get insincere, on what points
you get insincere,

316
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,138
what are the correcting points.

317
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:13,149
Keep a control on your mind to see how
does it become insincere.

318
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:18,375
You’ll be amazed that it’s simple to be
sincere than to be insincere.

319
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:24,342
Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than
to be deceiving

320
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:30,355
because you don’t have to think. To be
sincere you don’t have to think.

321
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:35,513
If you have to be insincere you have
to think, plan out and to find out methods,

322
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:41,307
all the loopholes and escapes, by which
you have to run away.

323
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:47,043
If you have to be captive of your sincerity
you don’t have to worry about anything

324
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:51,306
and that sincerity itself is rewarding.

325
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:55,131
This principle must be written down
in your hearts

326
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:59,030
that sincerity itself is rewarding.

327
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:03,866
You don’t have to go to anybody else

328
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:10,173
to ask for the reward of sincerity,
sincerity itself rewards you.

329
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:14,675
And that’s why you start enjoying your
own sincerity.

330
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:18,441
If you start seeing all these things
as a witness,

331
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:24,904
that how your sincerity has made you
so beautiful, so dignified

332
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:30,368
and how you have started rising in your
self-esteem,

333
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:35,824
you’ll be amazed how sincerity itself
is a big force

334
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:42,872
which will manifest its living dynamism
in you

335
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:45,422
and you’ll be a transformed person.

336
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:50,818
This transformation within you is going
to change the whole world.

337
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:57,514
People are going to see that you are
no more a confused person,

338
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:02,876
you are not a person who is doubting and
neither you are a person who is a fanatic.

339
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:07,872
You are not a blind person and you are
a person who is alert and aware

340
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:12,179
and who can see things better than others.

341
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,628
So, Divine is only interested in such
people.

342
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:23,015
As I have told you before that Divine
is more interested

343
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:31,272
in a little worm which is alert and aware
than in a palace of a king which is dead.

344
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:38,043
The more alert you become the more Divine
takes interest in you.

345
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:44,921
But this alertness is nothing but
the enlightenment of your sincerity.

346
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,798
You’ll be amazed how sincerity is
the thing.

347
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:55,646
That means you are loyal to yourself.
You have to be loyal and not disloyal.

348
00:38:55,847 --> 00:39:02,995
The loyalty to yourself is sincerity and
that is how I have managed Sahaja Yoga.

349
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:09,375
But sincerity is My nature, I don’t have
to strive for it. I cannot get out of it.

350
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:17,289
While, if I am your ideal you should try
to imbibe My nature, within yourself.

351
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:24,430
And then you will be amazed how you are
connected with Me.

352
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:34,245
Then we all move like one wave, one being,
one personality.

353
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:41,268
That is the achievement of this
Sahasrar Day.

354
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:50,204
Sincerity of purpose brought in action,
not theory and philosophy,

355
00:39:50,405 --> 00:39:58,458
but in action, active sincerity, in every
way, and patience –

356
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:04,688
all these things will bring forth
the complete integration within.

357
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:08,693
Once your transformation starts working
out,

358
00:40:08,894 --> 00:40:12,752
if human beings start getting transformed,

359
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:18,052
tomorrow you will be placed at the helm
of affairs everywhere in the society.

360
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:23,256
Try to contact other people at your own
level.

361
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:28,722
Whatever may be the category of life you
are leading please try to contact them.

362
00:40:28,923 --> 00:40:34,450
By doing so you create an atmosphere

363
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:44,430
which starts another circle of evolution

364
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:52,508
which is the outside integration where
the societies get integrated.

365
00:40:52,709 --> 00:41:03,817
All the people who profess different
religions come to this Sahaja Yoga

366
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:09,997
which is today the fruit of all
the religions.

367
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:15,683
The integration between political and
economic situations,

368
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:23,716
complete ideologies, will integrate because
the source of all these is the same.

369
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:32,956
It has gone into disintegration because
of its artificial identifications.

370
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:42,776
That’s how we’ll integrate the whole world
into a beautiful integrated Creation,

371
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:52,208
with the purpose of blissful existence
for all of us to enjoy!

372
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:58,746
Good times are ahead now. Maybe
next Sahasrar Day,

373
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:06,390
if I am with you, we will start seeing
what I have said today.

374
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:11,452
But today all of you must know

375
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:19,921
that you are the base of Sahaja Yoga
in UK and in Europe.

376
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:28,725
Try to become sincere and sincere and
sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

377
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:48,349
I bless you all with your sincerity and
today I have to tell you

378
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:55,026
a few more secrets about Sahaja Yog
is that,

379
00:42:55,227 --> 00:43:01,883
for the puja we should not get people
who are of mediocre nature

380
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:06,820
because to bear up puja is very difficult.

381
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:13,509
People [who] have not yet understood
the value of My Being,

382
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:23,725
of My feet, of My hands, they cannot, they
do not deserve to be here.

383
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:26,454
So do not get anybody because he is
your friend,

384
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:30,678
or a sister, or a brother just down here.

385
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:36,774
Is wrong. You are spoiling the chances
of the poor person

386
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:41,805
because it is too much for him,
he cannot bear it.

387
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:45,525
It is meant for very few people.

388
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:53,209
So remember that it is not meant for many
people.

389
00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:03,422
Now what we call as the charan-amrut is,
means the ambrose of My feet,

390
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:12,238
or you can say ambrose of My feet, is not
meant for everyone.

391
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:18,976
Neither the blessings of the puja are not
meant for everyone.

392
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,365
So try to avoid people who are not yet
fully equipped.

393
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:29,023
First thing they will start is doubting.

394
00:44:29,224 --> 00:44:36,143
If they do not doubt, also, there will be
a problem with the protocol.

395
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:39,674
They won’t be able to accept it with
that protocol.

396
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:45,245
It’s a very great privilege to be here

397
00:44:45,446 --> 00:44:50,890
and this privilege cannot be granted
to every person.

398
00:44:56,785 --> 00:45:01,995
If you could understand this is the secret
of Sahaja Yoga

399
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:10,211
and in this secret you have to get very
few people to begin with.

400
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:18,062
Everything is going to be exposed one day,
but not to everyone.

401
00:45:20,689 --> 00:45:31,527
If you can recognise this that you are
privileged,

402
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:37,758
then you will behave in a way that you
have been given this privilege.

403
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:46,654
Today’s day there are many people in
the whole world who are meditating.

404
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:52,547
I am thinking of all those people.

405
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:56,482
You have to also think [of] all of them

406
00:45:57,064 --> 00:46:01,851
and know that they are part and parcel
of My Being as you all are

407
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:05,222
and you are the alert ones.

408
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:14,858
So, at this time in this puja, you are not
only doing puja for yourself,

409
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,841
for London people, but for the whole world.

410
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:27,252
Not only for Sahaja Yogis who are all over,
of course for them also,

411
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:36,510
but in this puja you are expressing
yourself as Sahaja Yogis,

412
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:41,791
who have recognised Me, and are requesting
to bless the rest of the people

413
00:46:41,992 --> 00:46:46,131
so that they also recognise Me as you
have recognised.

414
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:58,102
By this puja I hope recognition will be
much more clearer.

415
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,626
By My recognition only you will recognise
yourself

416
00:47:02,827 --> 00:47:07,778
and the whole thing will work out in
a very, very beautiful manner.

417
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:11,962
As I have said, next year, on 5th of May,

418
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:15,716
we’ll see the results of what I am saying
today.

419
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:23,121
Only thing [is] I want you to be sincere,
not to play games in Sahaja Yoga.

420
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:26,367
It will harm you very much

421
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:39,718
and harm also other Sahaja Yogis, so
don’t try to play games.

422
00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:48,091
It will harm you because you will be
harming the path of emancipation

423
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:55,893
and as a result you will be punished,
as a result you will be the loser.

424
00:47:56,094 --> 00:48:02,084
So please try to be sincere. It is not
difficult.

425
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:06,766
This is not the way to be taken: many
people I have seen,

426
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,822
they think I am chastitising and all these
words are wrong

427
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,202
 for Mataji it should not be used, [that]

428
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:16,173
there are many words which should not
be used for Me.

429
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:20,982
It is just your privilege to be here

430
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:28,543
and [you] must understand that privileges
are given to people who are deserving.

431
00:48:28,744 --> 00:48:33,162
I am telling you these things because
you are deserving.

432
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:39,173
And in that condition you must understand
that this is a great privilege

433
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:44,516
that I am telling you all these things
and that you should feel enamoured

434
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:51,126
that I am telling you that sincerity is
the key of your success.

435
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:54,036
It’s a privilege. I am giving you the key.

436
00:48:54,236 --> 00:48:59,714
While as it is, you see, the Western mind
is, people think that,

437
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,371
if you tell somebody something like that
they can use a word like ‘chastitise’ (sic)

438
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:07,327
and all these words are not to be.

439
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:12,322
Must use words which are protocolish.
[It’s] not proper.

440
00:49:12,523 --> 00:49:17,686
If in your protocol you are not alright,
you know how you start fitting

441
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:23,175
wrong bolts into wrong nuts and spoil
the whole joke,

442
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:28,697
so be careful as to how you take it.
Take it as a privilege.

443
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:32,789
It’s a VIP treatment for you.
You are all VIP’s.

444
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:39,034
I cannot talk like this to the multitudes
but I can tell you this

445
00:49:39,235 --> 00:49:43,493
because I want to give you the complete
keys.

446
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:49,379
If you can look at yourself as how
privileged you are and understanding it,

447
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:57,633
understanding what all Sahaja Yoga is,
then you will understand

448
00:49:57,834 --> 00:50:04,784
that what a privilege it is for you to be
here, what fortune,

449
00:50:04,985 --> 00:50:12,699
what reward for what you have done.

450
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:24,807
How many lives have been completely
rewarded by being here.

451
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:34,022
This will help you to do puja in a more
sincere manner.

452
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:37,128
May God bless you.

453
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:43,641
Now we must meditate, also, after puja,

454
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:50,005
because My vibrations you do not suck in
without meditation I have seen.

455
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:55,277
And always it happens – so far I have had
very few pujas

456
00:50:55,478 --> 00:50:58,644
in which My whole vibrations were
sucked in.

457
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:02,253
If you have sincerity about it, really
the sincerity part of it,

458
00:51:02,454 --> 00:51:05,604
you’ll suck all My vibrations.

459
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,834
Tell your mind not to ask questions and
to misbehave

460
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,611
but to suck the vibrations clearly.

461
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:19,318
This is for your own nourishment,

462
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:26,275
for your own growth, for your own
enjoyment.

463
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:27,914
May God bless you.

464
00:51:28,115 --> 00:51:34,229
Today I am so heavy laden already,
that I can’t open My eyes.

465
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:39,198
May God bless you.
