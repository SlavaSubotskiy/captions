1
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:14,623
It is very difficult to describe this inner
joy.

2
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:19,178
You can only enjoy it, you can only
feel it.

3
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:31,114
It's something so innate to see that
so many of you

4
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:35,555
have learnt this difficult music

5
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:40,226
and all of you have been enjoying it.

6
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:50,980
I went to various places in the West
and I felt that,

7
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:55,869
“Why even small little children,

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,404
boys and girls, take to something which is
self-destructive? Why?

9
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,896
Why do they take to drugs? Why do they take

10
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:08,920
Why do they take to all these things which
are self-destructive?”

11
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:12,801
I mean, you could blame the parents
to some extent

12
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:18,184
but on the whole, there was something
within them which was troubling them,

13
00:01:18,385 --> 00:01:24,007
which was trying to say that, “That's
not true.

14
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,768
That's not the thing, that's not the thing
that you want.”

15
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:35,229
And that's what made them go into all kinds
of various types of rebellion, I should say,

16
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,881
against all the accepted truths

17
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:43,979
or accepted goodness or value system.

18
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:47,581
And I just thought that, of course,
in India

19
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:50,515
the parents are rather strict, I must say
'right',

20
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:53,116
 but there's one more thing in India:

21
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:56,693
there's a big outlet for them

22
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:02,930
and I found that outlet was the talent
that they had.

23
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:06,423
They had lots of talents, all of them,
I felt

24
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:08,652
when I talked to them and this and that.

25
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:14,523
I felt that they have lots of talent but
there is no way to express it.

26
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:25,831
Certain people have been doing some sort
of an haphazard expression, I should say,

27
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:32,899
and they could not understand themselves
why they were doing it.

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,730
And this was the main thing that was
lacking, I think, in the West

29
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:42,851
that the children had no way of expressing
themselves,

30
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:45,526
of expressing their talent.

31
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:49,580
And this talent was making them mad,
I think,

32
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:56,128
that was making them absolutely rebellious.

33
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,598
It was not their mistake by any chance,

34
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:05,820
It was an energy within which was bubbling
and had no outlet.

35
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:14,520
And whatever outlet they had was not
recognized, was not appreciated.

36
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:20,194
And this made me feel that if these
children are given

37
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:24,673
an outlet, a means of expressing
themselves,

38
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:27,008
I am sure they’ll take to it.

39
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,876
They'll forget all these things,

40
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:35,256
they'll never take to all self-destructive
ideas

41
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:38,839
because they were angry with them, I think.

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,212
And it worked; it worked in the sense that
first I wanted

43
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:52,333
Yogi (Mahajan) to start a school for small
children.

44
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:56,766
And I was surprised how these children took

45
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,928
to another kind of lifestyle, very
disciplined style

46
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:07,011
and... they were very different children.

47
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:13,351
Like in the West I found a child, supposing
you take him to the shop,

48
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:18,137
he'll make you mad because he will say,
“Buy me this and buy me that and...”,

49
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:22,815
not understanding that one cannot
afford it.

50
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:31,156
And left to himself, I would say, that he
would go on buying the whole of the market.

51
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:34,709
He was so mad about it.

52
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,152
But I thought that there was some sort
of a thing

53
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:42,086
that's lacking in him, in satisfaction.

54
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:50,313
On the contrary, in India if you take one
boy or a girl to the market,

55
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:52,575
they'll say, “Bas, bas - only one,

56
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,945
one will do.” Big, very big problem.

57
00:04:56,146 --> 00:05:00,633
I had my own granddaughters, I took them
once to Delhi

58
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,815
because they had broken their chappals
[slippers], you know,

59
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:07,815
and they had only one pair. The parents
have else to do, no problem,

60
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,764
but one chappal of that was broken, I said,
“All right, you come along.

61
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,969
Now in Delhi you can get good ones,
we'll buy from them.”

62
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:19,832
So they came and I bought for them.

63
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,881
They said, “Nani, at any cost we'll not
take the second one.

64
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,966
We'll just take one.”

65
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,253
But I said, “Supposing this breaks. Then
what will happen?

66
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:35,197
Then you will come back again to Delhi
to buy chappals?

67
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,485
Have one spare at least.”

68
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:42,644
They wouldn't listen and they ran away
into the car.

69
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:46,907
I went there, I said, “What are you doing?
Why don't you buy chappals for yourselves?”

70
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:50,144
“Why do you want to waste your money, Nani?

71
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:54,331
You can use it for something else.”

72
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:59,045
Now, I was surprised the way they were
so satisfied.

73
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,211
Of course, they are born realized,
no doubt,

74
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:05,265
but also the whole atmosphere.

75
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:11,263
I felt that this atmosphere if the children
from the West can get,

76
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:18,574
they will definitely prosper, they'll
definitely express themselves

77
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:22,556
and they'll become excellent people.

78
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,725
But I didn't know their energy was
so much, you see.

79
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:32,652
After, my brother - your Babamama -
I asked him,

80
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,864
“Why not start an Academy of music?”

81
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,472
And when they came to music, I was
surprised.

82
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:45,896
I was really surprised when we had not
expected anything from them,

83
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:48,907
within three months, within four months,

84
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:54,220
they picked up such a difficult music
style.

85
00:06:54,421 --> 00:07:00,914
It's impossible, it's impossible for
Indians to do that.

86
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:04,311
They can never do [it] in four, four
months’ time.

87
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:09,441
Oh baba, I've seen in my own family, there
were musicians

88
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:14,881
and my sisters, my brothers, for hours
together...

89
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:22,409
Every morning they used to get up at about
five o'clock and start their music.

90
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:28,840
Every day rehearse for three, four hours,
every day.

91
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,854
And I used to think, “Now, when will this
end?”

92
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:36,063
I mean, after all, if somebody has to sleep
after 5:00, you can't, just can't sleep.

93
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:40,707
But that's a custom in India to get up very
early in the morning.

94
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:46,607
But the way these people are learning it
so fast, it is

95
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:52,688
because that urge to express themselves
was inside very, very strong,

96
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,640
much stronger than Indians. Just imagine!

97
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:02,395
I can tell you very clearly, I have never
heard of anybody

98
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:08,796
learning this difficult music in three
months and four months.

99
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:12,707
For years together they would not learn.

100
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:18,125
Same about you people: How you have
started appreciating it,

101
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:21,402
I just don't know.

102
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:26,821
I mean, it's a different atmosphere that
has started,

103
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:32,654
so full of hope and joy.

104
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:37,591
You see now, there was one fellow who
went to Belgium.

105
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:42,660
He was an Italian, Italian Sahaja Yogi.

106
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,802
He said, “Mother, I was surprised.

107
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:48,269
There was a nice program with the Indians,

108
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,931
and the Indian Consulate had arranged,
so I went to the program.

109
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:57,256
And they were talking to each other and
some of them went out,

110
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:00,959
some of them came in, these Indians.

111
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,679
They never understood that it was Pilu rag,

112
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,454
that one they couldn't recognize.

113
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,641
Even an ordinary Pilu rag they cannot
recognize.”

114
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,447
I was surprised that this Italian,
that he...

115
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:18,244
What he's saying is really, I've seen it.

116
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:26,730
The Indians when they go for this kind
of a very deep type of music,

117
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:32,065
after 15 minutes they start slipping out.

118
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:38,499
Also they told me that in England they went

119
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,654
to a music centre or we can say for
the buying of the records or something.

120
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:50,586
So, all the boys who were there, who were
Indians,

121
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:55,711
were buying pop music, that music.

122
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:59,616
And they looked at these Sahaja Yogis,
they said, “Are you stupid fools?

123
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:04,805
Why are you buying this music, this Indian
music?

124
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:07,111
What is there in this Indian music?”

125
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:12,428
They said, “It's better not to talk to you
because you are gone cases.”

126
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,536
Now, you see because, somehow or other,

127
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:19,798
this is a Sahaj trick I think,

128
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,091
that your energy's tuned up

129
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:27,198
to a very subtle and deep understanding
of music.

130
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,551
Otherwise, it would never have worked
like this.

131
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:34,126
I mean, is the Kundalini, of course,
no doubt.

132
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:41,683
But the way she has nourished you
to absorb, to understand, to enjoy.

133
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:45,808
This is very subtle music.

134
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,655
And it has happened more with the Western
people

135
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:54,462
than with the Indians, I'm sorry to say.

136
00:10:54,663 --> 00:11:00,916
But Indians don't have that much of
understanding, nor that much of enjoyment.

137
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:08,276
Westerners may not, may not understand
but they enjoy.

138
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:15,292
Indians will, those who are, I mean,
a little bit educated in music,

139
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:19,456
will start finding out faults,

140
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:23,108
finding out ragas, “This was not good,
that...”.

141
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:30,074
No, but not Westerners: Western people
are so humble about it.

142
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,534
Isn't it remarkable?

143
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:39,276
How is it they have picked up so quickly
and have understood?

144
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,317
Because they have become subtler.

145
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:45,022
This is the only thing I can say: they have
become subtler

146
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:51,550
and their energies are flowing through
the subtler level.

147
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:55,892
It's surprising for Babamama, also for me,
for everyone

148
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,255
that in three, four months how can you
play Malkauns rag?

149
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,093
First time I heard, I started wondering,
“How can that be?”

150
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:18,389
And that gives such a hope to save this
music.

151
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:23,183
It may be that in India it may be
declining,

152
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:28,800
but in the West it's rising.

153
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:35,287
Is the other way round: The Sun rises from
the East and sets on the West;

154
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:40,844
here is the other way round now for music
and I would request all the Indians

155
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:45,503
to develop that subtle understanding.

156
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:57,079
You see, say if you are a honeybee, only
then you can suck in the honey.

157
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:02,577
The flies cannot.

158
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:06,327
So you have to develop that sensitivity.

159
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:09,351
I would say to Indians, I'm sorry to say

160
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:13,850
that you have to develop that sensitivity
within you,

161
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:17,300
which is possible through meditation

162
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:24,949
and through Kundalini awakening and
balancing

163
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:31,920
and ultimately getting connected with this
all-pervading power of Chaitanya.

164
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:35,883
Because Sound is the second stage.

165
00:13:36,085 --> 00:13:38,860
First was, of course, they said the Word.

166
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:43,548
But it was silent, came into Sound

167
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:51,274
and if you can understand the subtle
of the Sound within you,

168
00:13:52,257 --> 00:14:00,803
if you can get one with it, it gives you
that joy.

169
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:07,766
But you will be surprised, I have never
studied music, never, all my life.

170
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:15,971
Because, you see, I don't know why but
somehow I never studied

171
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:20,868
because I could not have a guru, this is
the problem was.

172
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,816
I couldn't have a guru, so somehow or
other, I never studied music.

173
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:32,146
But what I have is the same as you have now

174
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:40,491
is that subtle enjoyment sense of music.

175
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:43,440
And that's why I say this is divine.

176
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:45,971
Of course, I also enjoy some pop music,

177
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,891
also enjoy western music very much

178
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:52,963
and the Western great composers I enjoy,
no doubt.

179
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:57,437
But this music has one speciality -

180
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:05,910
that nothing is written down, there is
no composer.

181
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:14,026
The musician is the composer, he is
the player and he is the book.

182
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:18,274
It's so individualistic if you see that,

183
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:21,291
but today I was happy to see all of them.

184
00:15:21,493 --> 00:15:27,072
This is the western side of it

185
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,653
that so many of them put together were
singing, you see,

186
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:35,369
like a choir but not so bad as that.

187
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:43,080
And in the choir, you see, because I have
attended many choirs also,

188
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:47,385
it was too systematic, too disciplined;

189
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:52,319
this is not. Here it is complete freedom
within themselves.

190
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,208
And the whole thing worked out so well,
I mean,

191
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:59,090
it's such a good combination of both
the things:

192
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,301
One side is the music, another side is
the collectivity.

193
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:11,098
So I have never said a word about Baba's
University or Academy,

194
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,096
but I told him that, “I'm very proud
of you.”

195
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:29,372
He has very lovingly brought up this
Academy

196
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:39,122
and has that character of our old guru
system which is very important.

197
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:49,014
That keeps the whole place very holy,
as you call 'pavana'.

198
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:51,548
And that is working out. He is working
very hard.

199
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,952
I know Baba is working very hard,

200
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:57,484
and all of you are working very hard
to help him.

201
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:03,236
But this Academy will definitely, I'm sure,
one day will give

202
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:09,830
that universal knowledge of that subtle
thing I am telling you about.

203
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:25,616
I know it is late today and tonight, I
should say, but I am used to this more,

204
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:30,021
because, you see, in our - when we were
young -

205
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:34,101
my father was so fond of music and
musicians

206
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,683
that so many times we have slept at about
five o'clock in the morning.

207
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:40,204
So, [it] makes no difference to me.

208
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:44,406
Same I find in you, people, that you are,
the way you are enjoying.

209
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:48,101
So we have great hope of saving our young
people

210
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:55,875
who are going astray, people who are
frustrated,

211
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:03,162
people who are unhappy because they have
no satisfaction;

212
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:10,704
people who are committing suicide
in the affluent countries.

213
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:14,355
Also in our country people who are
becoming politicians,

214
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:18,851
I think, that's the worst thing that can
happen to anyone.

215
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:27,390
Also we have people who are doing all kinds
of criminal things,

216
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:32,711
doing all kinds of violence and everything.

217
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:41,552
All that can be completely covered with
the ocean of music.

218
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,349
And if it is done by Sahaja Yogis,

219
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,869
it would be such a great emancipation
for the whole world

220
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,100
which is absolutely due and it is going
to work out.

221
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:00,348
So I am thankful to Babamama

222
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,138
and to all others who are supporting
him in this

223
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:14,065
and I hope you all will enjoy this music
on a very subtle level.

224
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:21,044
Because immediately with the mind which
reacts, one starts discussing,

225
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:26,014
arguing, condemning also.

226
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:32,495
That's not the way to understand this
music, but just to enjoy it.

227
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:38,647
Enjoyment - it hasn't got two sides - is
only enjoyment, single,

228
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:43,606
and that should happen to you, all of you.

229
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:54,295
I am so much, so much overwhelmed really
by this beautiful renderings we have had.

230
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,091
For example now we had from Aurangabad.

231
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:00,258
I mean, I can't believe that in Aurangabad

232
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,459
you could have such beautiful dancing.

233
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:11,270
This Mr. Aurangzeb, after whom this name
is given - Aurangabad.

234
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,032
[Marathi] -

235
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:17,287
I don't know why it's called Aurangabad,
whatever it is.

236
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:21,056
He was such a horribly fanatic man

237
00:20:21,257 --> 00:20:27,127
and every day he used to kill so many
Hindus.

238
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,655
And when... Thank God he was a thin man.

239
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:35,514
He was weaved in their thread, Janaeu
thread.

240
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:39,779
How many were killed, you know. Imagine
what a cruel man he was,

241
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,202
and under his name is this Aurangabad.
If you have to change any name

242
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:49,695
in this country, it should be Aurangzeb
and Aurangabad.

243
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:54,317
And he had no sense of music,

244
00:20:54,518 --> 00:20:57,577
he never used to listen to music, you know,

245
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:02,810
but he was extremely honest; that's another
point about honesty.

246
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:09,666
And he would not take any money for his
survival from the state.

247
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:17,547
He used to stitch topis [hats] and sell
them. Can you imagine?

248
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:20,602
If he had not done that and had been

249
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:23,778
little bit loving person, would have been
much better.

250
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:27,883
But from that Aurangabad comes this music
and dancing.

251
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:32,435
I was amazed. I thought, “How can it be?”

252
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:35,250
How did they call it Aurangabad, I don't
know,

253
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:39,771
but he's the one who hated music.

254
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,779
How could these people be born there?

255
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,867
And what dancing they showed.

256
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:50,164
Also you have seen the Kuchipudi

257
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:56,490
from Baba’s Institute was another one –
I must – just eye-opener, I tell you.

258
00:21:56,698 --> 00:22:02,037
These are girls from, absolutely from
countries

259
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,954
where they have never known all this.

260
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:09,437
And in such a short time to learn such
a dance like Kuchipudi,

261
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:14,089
is the most difficult dance, very fast.

262
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,660
“My goodness!”, I thought that,

263
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:20,045
“What has happened to them?”

264
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:23,340
And you may say, “Mother, this is due
to Sahaj”,

265
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:30,102
whatever it is, but Sahaj also is to be
borne by you people.

266
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:36,691
Now if you have a very small little candle,
how much it can burn?

267
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:43,230
But these are like the ocean of energies

268
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:48,821
and the way they are expressing themselves
is remarkable.

269
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:51,861
Of course, I love you very much

270
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:56,341
and it is not out of that love and
admiration I am saying this,

271
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,296
but it's a fact, is a reality.

272
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:07,326
I, I had no idea that one day it will go
that well

273
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:17,573
and this global movement is going to work
out wonders.

274
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:23,103
You must spread also the music along
with the vibrations.

275
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:26,305
I am sure it would be good.

276
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:32,625
Really, for definite.
(Marathi)

277
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:38,159
I - you can't believe, I asked Babamama,
“Who is, how is it?”

278
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:43,647
He said, “Only four months’ time.”
Everybody four months.

279
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:49,047
Very remarkable. Then we have one from
Spain.

280
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,495
I saw him playing Spanish,

281
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,924
but Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

282
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:58,204
because it goes hectic, you know.

283
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:03,962
It is very fast, sometimes very slow, but
it's very rhythmic, but is hectic.

284
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:08,601
Ours is very much, I should say,
disciplined.

285
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:12,965
Whatever it is, he also has played so well.

286
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:17,188
So there are so many examples to show,

287
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,471
that you may be from the Western country.

288
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,759
It's better to be from the Western country
now for music than from this.

289
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,010
I can't understand really, it's a, it's
a miracle,

290
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:41,221
but why should this miracle work in the
West and not in India I don't understand.

291
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:44,453
Though I am sure the Indians are enjoying
this music,

292
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:46,952
no doubt, because they are all Sahaja
Yogis.

293
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,009
But you go to any program -

294
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,724
any other program where there are very
few Sahaja Yogis -

295
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:59,589
you will see that the way they behave,
without any respect.

296
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:04,022
The respect that is paid in India to
the musicians has to be

297
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:10,352
of a very high level - or any talents -
say even art...

298
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:16,279
See also people who make beautiful things
from their hands.

299
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,354
All these people who are so talented, are
to be respected very much

300
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:26,510
because it's a special gift God has given
them.

301
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:30,635
Now in India, we have got a very big
problem also.

302
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:41,974
All great artists got into the... I should
say, into the influence of the West,

303
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:50,320
and so many of them take scotch whisky.
What do you say to that?

304
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:57,917
So many; and their music is finished.

305
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:00,661
You can't even play cricket with scotch
whisky,

306
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:04,800
leave alone music.

307
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,801
And this Western influence of taking drinks
and things like that

308
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:16,177
has ruined our musicians and I don't know
what's going to happen.

309
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:19,764
I was quite worried that how is it going
to be retained

310
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:23,634
in this country, but now I have great hopes

311
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:27,724
because if they see the Western people
doing so well...

312
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:36,085
You see, for Indians, this goes into their
heads that, “How can they do it?”

313
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,313
Oh, that goes very much...

314
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:45,734
I mean if they see Western people doing
such good music,

315
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:51,938
it's very influential. So, instead of
having any Indian artist

316
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:56,112
on the stage, we should really bring
foreign.

317
00:26:56,314 --> 00:27:01,889
It will have a great effect, I tell you,
on Indians. (Marathi)

318
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,647
It was very shameful the way sometimes
Indians behave

319
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:13,310
in a classical music programs, very
shameful, for anybody.

320
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:17,332
They have no sense, nothing and they go
on misbehaving.

321
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:25,064
They come there for social, social affair,
I think, that's all.

322
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,500
On this point, we Indians as Sahaja Yogis

323
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:35,725
are to be responsible and to see for
yourself

324
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:45,032
how much they have achieved, how much
they have understood.

325
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:48,014
Somebody who saw them said,

326
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:56,289
“Mother, now even in Indian music if they
go ahead of us, what will happen to us?”

327
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:01,429
But still, we have very great musicians,

328
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,551
as you have Arun Apte before you.

329
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:15,667
I must tell you, we had a program in Puna,

330
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:20,076
that's called as Shere, and I was very
tired.

331
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:22,973
And so I told Yogi (Mahajan), “What is
in the program, next one?”

332
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:29,868
He said, “Some musician has come. He wanted
to sing, so he has come.”

333
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,962
I said, “Which musician?” “I don't know
his name...”

334
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:35,084
But you see, Yogi (Mahajan), I think, was
that time

335
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:40,675
not so much music-minded. Typical
Indian style.

336
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:43,673
“So Mother, You go and sleep.”

337
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:48,687
So I laid down and I heard his voice
and I heard his music.

338
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:54,871
I said, “Who is this singing?” I came back,
I changed my sari,

339
00:28:55,073 --> 00:29:00,645
I asked Yogi, “Who is he?” They told me
the name.

340
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,740
I said, “He's a great singer!

341
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:07,994
What do you understand? How much are
you going to pay him?”

342
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:14,117
He told me such a meagre thing, I said,
“Are you mad, Yogi?

343
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:21,671
Then I went out and I heard his great
music.

344
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,972
I've heard his guru also before

345
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,715
who was also very great that time,

346
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:31,611
and also Ajit Kadkade is his gurubandhu,
both of them are.

347
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:37,097
But I was surprised that none of
the Indians could understand him,

348
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:40,144
what he was singing.

349
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:47,002
And this Maharashtra is known for music,
for classical music.

350
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:53,290
But surprisingly, it's not that level now
that we had seen.

351
00:29:53,491 --> 00:30:01,839
I am happy to see this resurrection
of Indian music through you people.

352
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:13,885
That was one of my greatest desire to get
the art, handicrafts and music -

353
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:21,702
all kinds of things which are created
through this talent - should prosper.

354
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:27,068
And I am very happy to see that despite
it's so late -

355
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:30,962
I don't know what is the time, oh my God -

356
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,656
you all are still alert and enjoying.

357
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:43,892
I can't say about other artists who have
very much impressed you and impressed me.

358
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:49,704
So this is a very good chance -
Ganapatipule - where we can have

359
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:56,431
a very nice music, beautiful music,
so enjoyable.

360
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:59,751
Thank you very much.
