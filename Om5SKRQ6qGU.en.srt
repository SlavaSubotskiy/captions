1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,680
it should please me

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,160

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,200
it put me in your heart

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,079
just try to put me in your heart it's

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,680
very simple

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:47,520
i'm before you now i am in person

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
i was trying to give realization to one

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,039
of my relations yes

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,559
today and i said that you don't lose

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,039
your eyes he said no

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,800
i'm not looking at your face because

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,840
when i see you

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,479
i feel you are my aunt

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
but i'm just looking at your feet so

18
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,520
that

19
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,439
i shouldn't feel any more that you are

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
my aunt

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,439
you are very great and your face is the

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,439
one that puts me into illusions

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,560
he could see it's a mahamaya he said

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,159
only at your feet

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,360
i look and through your feet only

26
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,400
i can get over this barrier this feeling

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,680
in the same way when i am a mahamaya i

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
know i am i had to be

29
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,840
but you have to put my

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
feet into your heart

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
just by feet into your heart

32
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,560
because photo face everything

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
might be an illusion

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:10,479
might be by seeing my face you do not

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,479
get over your barriers

36
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,680

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:39,280

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,080
of superficiality let me

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,560
let me see your feet in my heart

53
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
only such people

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,400
even brahma vishnu mahesha have done

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
that

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
so don't you think you have to do it

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
so humble down yourself humble down

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
yourself

59
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,400
in your heart humble down in your

60
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,319
heart enjoy your humility enjoy your

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
virtues

62
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,280
the greatest virtue of sahaja yogi is

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,280
humility

64
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,760
now so many things you have seen

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
to convince you but in no way it can

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,680
mean

67
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,080
any kind of subjection

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,799
because what subjection you can give me

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
think of that

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,840
when every subjection is a blessing what

71
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
subjection you are giving

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,440
every feeling in the heart is a blessing

73
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,080
just just now you feel it and you feel

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,080
the joy

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,840
in your heart

76
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,320
then what is your subjection about what

77
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
i can understand people who are just

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,680
newly calm or good for nothing

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,960
just but you are not on the periphery

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,639
but some of them do go into periphery in

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,080
no time you give them some work

82
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,560
finish if i am sweet to someone finished

83
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
if i see someone finished i mean this is

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
too much

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
i can't even be nice to you

86
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,479
if you do any mistakes or anything then

87
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
you feel

88
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,840
then you get your left visually

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
you've done your mistake or not finish

90
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,520
it you love me

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
maybe there's something wrong in the

92
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
love or maybe something has happened

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,080
doesn't matter

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,639
now i'm going to be cautious

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,280
i'm not going to make any mistakes how

96
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,320
could i

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
do this mistake because i i was not

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,039
fully in love

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
if i had loved something i would have

100
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,840
not done such a mistake

101
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,639
all right so develop your love no you

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,880
will do

103
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,039
i feel guilty because i have done such a

104
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,039
thing

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,360
so you miss this and that both so your

106
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,759
mistake becomes a barrier again

107
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
don't feel guilty about it we have to

108
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,440
progress further forget the past

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
forget the past forget the past we have

110
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
to go further we have to be serious

111
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
people

112
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
when we talk we should talk with that

113
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
dignity of that

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
or

115
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,039
that's very important and once you

116
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,600
develop that all your ekadasha will

117
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,600
disappear

118
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:34,080
ekadasha will disappear just think of

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:37,360
the awe

120
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,639
the silence and the joy and the

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:46,080
the joy of the

122
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,080
o is deep very deep like a sea

123
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
see on superficial level is very

124
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,960
turbulent but inside is

125
00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:00,240
silent absolutely silent feel

126
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,240
that depth without all you cannot go

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
down
