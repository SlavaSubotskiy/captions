1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:17,210
[Last] time I talked to you about collectivity 
outside your own shell, how, after your Realisation,

2
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:28,949
after your second birth, you become conscious 
that you are no more an egg but, now, you

3
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,041
have become part and parcel of the whole.

4
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,860
You realise it gradually.

5
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:49,890
In the beginning only what you feel is nothing 
but cool breeze blowing into your hands or

6
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,080
maybe little tingling sometimes or maybe some 
heaviness, to begin with.

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,310
But then, gradually you realise it.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:07,710
Some people do realise it in a very quick 
way.

9
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:21,219
But as the infrastructure within is not properly 
fixed, Realisation comes very, very slowly.

10
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:28,360
I spoke to you about our infrastructure within.

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:42,930
Now the faith in God or faith in anything 
that is Divine, also in the Divine Power,

12
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,630
is not easy to achieve logically.

13
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,880
Some people have faith in God because they 
have been taught from childhood that there

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,450
is God.

15
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,420
Maybe they think [that] by relying on something 
like God, somewhere in the air, they are doing

16
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,209
better in life.

17
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,939
There could be many reasons why people have 
faith in God.

18
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:17,780
But actually, when you feel the presence of 
Divine Power within you and outside, it is

19
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,760
hard to believe that it is the Divine Power.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,840
And even if you know all about it, it is difficult 
to assume it.

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:36,610
It’s sometimes a surprise to many Sahaja 
Yogis, when they see around people who have

22
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,440
got Realisation, who have got cool breeze 
flowing from their hand and they disappear.

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,799
They just can’t understand such people that 
– how it has happened that these people

24
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,230
have come to a program, one day, they have 
got Realisation, they have got cool breeze

25
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,540
and then they have disappeared?

26
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,019
Are they the people who are little-believers 
or half-baked or mediocres?

27
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:07,439
Or what is it that they have no curiosity 
any further to go?

28
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:17,590
Or that they are not intelligent enough to 
understand that there’s something very dynamic,

29
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,739
something very new, very natural [that] has 
happened to them?

30
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:31,349
It is not a cult, they can see for themselves, 
because as in a cult there’s a mass hysteria

31
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,720
or some abnormalities, there’s no abnormality 
with these people, they are very normal.

32
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,159
Despite all these things, all the proof to 
believe that there is Divine Power around

33
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,700
us and that now it is flowing through you, 
it’s there.

34
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,210
But still people don’t believe in it.

35
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,629
Then why?

36
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:52,629
What is the reason?

37
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:06,370
We have to see what is the reason why we are 
not able to still accept that this is what

38
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,569
it is.

39
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:16,070
The time when great incarnations were on this 
Earth, when people like Mohammed and people

40
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,090
like Christ, Gautam Buddha, all these people 
came on this Earth – very recently I should

41
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:29,430
say – nobody believed that they are incarnations 
or they are Son of God.

42
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,080
I mean this is the only problem they had – to 
accept that He was Son of God.

43
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,910
I mean this was the only problem they were 
struggling [with], all of them, whether they

44
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:44,150
were Jews or Muslims and such communities, 
they could not accept that He was the Son

45
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,150
of God.

46
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,590
I mean what is the harm in accepting the situation.

47
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,510
Supposing He is the Son of God, after all 
there’s no property distribution going on,

48
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,830
there’s nothing like a will God has written 
that, “I’ll give it to my Son,” that

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,270
we should contest it.

50
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,580
But people could not accept it.

51
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:11,340
Now one may say that, at that time, that nobody 
felt the cool breeze, nobody felt the connection

52
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,520
with the whole.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,370
But today also, today also the situation is 
the same.

54
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:28,320
Situation is the same because of a single 
simple reason that: we ourselves are not integrated,

55
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,410
we ourselves are not part of ourselves.

56
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:42,419
Our mind is running one side; our body is 
running another side, our heart is running

57
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:49,669
in another direction, our sense organs are 
running in a different direction, our liver

58
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,750
is functioning in a different way.

59
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,279
We are not at all integrated ourselves.

60
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:03,960
And as long as this integration is not there, 
even if you feel the Divine Power, even if

61
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,360
you see the working of the Divine Power and 
mentally even if you accept that, “This

62
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,680
is what is happening to us!

63
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,500
It is there!”

64
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,500
And you see for yourself, even, the pulsation 
of the Kundalini, the rising of the Kundalini,

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,190
the breaking of the Sahastrara, even then 
it is difficult to believe that Sahaja Yoga

66
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,470
is the only way to have your rebirth.

67
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,759
On this point some people will fizzle out.

68
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,080
The others will fizzle out that, “Why it’s 
Mother who has to do it?”

69
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,850
Then there could be other problems also with 
people that, “Why didn’t happen to other

70
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,000
people.

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,730
They had to work very hard and why didn’t 
they get Realisation?”

72
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,180
How the mind works it is something very amazing.

73
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:08,030
And as I know all the permutations and combinations 
of human negativity about his Realisation,

74
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,280
I compassionately feel that it should be explained 
to them why they do it.

75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,669
I know it’s very frustrating sometimes and 
people feel so disgusted.

76
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,200
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis thinking that, 
it’s better to give up and cancel England

77
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,550
out of the map of Sahaj Yoga, or cancel France 
out of the map of Sahaj Yoga.

78
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,680
But that’s not the way.

79
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,729
We have to understand that their own connections 
are not yet built-in.

80
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:47,000
For example, this machine on which I am speaking 
now, is connected to the mains.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,199
But if it is not connected within itself, 
it will not work out.

82
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,680
Both things are important, that it should 
be connected outside as well as connected

83
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,259
within.

84
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:05,880
And that connection within is very, very much 
lacking in the modern human beings.

85
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,430
There are many reasons for that.

86
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,310
First of all, a big movement started long 
time back, among human beings, to deny God.

87
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,020
To keep it, at the most, as a formal discreet 
stuff.

88
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,120
It’s just a formal thing, you see, you don’t 
talk of religion at all.

89
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,470
You go to church, come back home or you go 
to a temple, come back home, sit down.

90
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,940
You are a so-called Hindu or a Christian or 
a Muslim, or something like that, but don’t

91
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,940
discuss it.

92
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,890
Because as soon as you start really discussing 
religion in the real way…I mean it’s easy

93
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:48,200
to give a sermon sitting on a pulpit, but 
to allow it to be discussed and logically

94
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,360
sorted out, it’s impossible to prove because 
it is mysterious.

95
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:04,279
It is a tremendous power that works it out.

96
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:12,720
This tremendous power that works it out cannot 
be understood by normal human being; cannot

97
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
be.

98
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,870
The working of this is so dynamic and the 
dimensions into which it works out is so great,

99
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,520
that a human mind cannot understand it, a 
normal [one].

100
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:33,120
Even a Sahaja Yogi, when he gets Realisation, 
is trying to understand, first, the dynamism

101
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,310
of this Divine Power.

102
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:42,551
And the dynamism of this Divine Power looks 
so simple, so simple, but they can’t believe

103
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:45,310
it that it could be that simple!

104
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:58,040
For example, if I say, sitting down here you 
can find out about anyone, the way his Kundalini

105
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
is.

106
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,760
I mean this is something people can’t just 
believe!

107
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,690
It’s too much for them to believe.

108
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:12,600
So, suddenly if you are exposed to something 
so dynamic, so great, so vast, so effective,

109
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,430
so efficient, it is impossible for human mind 
to understand that there’s such a great

110
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,270
thing [that] existed all through.

111
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,459
Because they never discussed it, they never 
talked about it.

112
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,920
You are not supposed to talk about it and 
discuss it.

113
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,770
That’s the main thing.

114
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,720
You cannot discuss religion.

115
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,350
And how far do we discuss even science?

116
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,300
Like they’ll say there is gravity in the 
Mother Earth.

117
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
Alright.

118
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,230
What is the nature of gravity in the Mother 
Earth?

119
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,760
How is it there?

120
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,240
Why is it there?

121
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
On that point – finished!

122
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,950
Science doesn’t give that reason.

123
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,130
They just say, “There is a pull of gravity 
in the Mother Earth.”

124
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,130
Finished!

125
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,450
Beyond that, they do not want to discuss, 
they just say, “Alright, up to this point

126
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,630
and beyond that nothing.”

127
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,970
So if you go to a man who is a priest or a 
religious man or one who is talking about

128
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,350
religion [he] will say, “Oh that’s God’s 
mystery.

129
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,130
That’s God’s mystery, we cannot go.

130
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,130
That’s a mystery.”

131
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,180
So, one says that “You cannot go beyond 
that, it is so, and that’s why we should

132
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,870
not worry about God.”

133
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,310
The another one says, “Alright, this is 
the mystery and the mystery we cannot unravel.”

134
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:30,420
So, “I’m not a believer in a thing that 
exists,” or “I am the believer of a thing

135
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,800
that exists but I cannot explain it.”

136
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,209
If you discuss a small thing [like] – how 
is it a particular flower becomes a fruit.

137
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,339
That is not discussed, you see, in elite society, 
it is not to be discussed.

138
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,420
At the most, you can talk about weather because 
there cannot be any quarrelling.

139
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,089
Even a thing like Falkland Island should not 
be discussed.

140
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,760
Maybe some Argentinean is sitting somewhere 
there, and he will be hurt about it, you see,

141
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,290
or something might happen.

142
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,800
So we are so careful as to what to discuss.

143
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:13,050
But if people sit down and discuss it they 
will know that there is a tremendous working

144
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,740
of the Divine Power around.

145
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,100
Can you count the amount of work it is doing?

146
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,120
It’s an impossibility.

147
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,180
Like a flower becoming a fruit.

148
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,290
Now take only one type of a flower.

149
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,570
How many there are in the whole world?

150
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,610
I mean if you think of it you just feel that, 
“It’s too much.”

151
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,029
We just cannot.

152
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,250
How this Mother Earth is moving with such 
a tremendous speed and we are just settled

153
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,060
down nicely here?

154
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,610
How many such suns and stars and constellations 
are moving?

155
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,050
There’s no end to it.

156
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,260
If you go to the microscopic side: just see 
the skin and you will be surprised that it

157
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:06,709
is 1/16th of an inch [and] has got such a 
beautiful, organised layer which works out

158
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,269
all the five functions of the skin.

159
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:11,940
It is tremendous!

160
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:18,230
And when seeing all these things, in going 
into science, if man doesn’t want to realise

161
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,940
that there must be a power that is doing all 
these organised things and there must be one

162
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:32,300
organised personality or maybe a controlling 
thing that is working it out, then it means

163
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,760
that they are trying to live with a myth because 
they cannot solve it.

164
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,190
The myth is that there is no God.

165
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,600
This is the biggest myth I have ever heard.

166
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:54,259
And to believe into such a thing that there 
is no God is just to accept, that as you are

167
00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:01,520
the highest of all, the lord of all the world, 
how can there be anybody higher?

168
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,550
This is one of the biggest hurdles of human 
beings in the modern times.

169
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:15,550
In the ancient times, olden times, it was 
so but it was not so much, to this extent

170
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,829
that now man thinks that he is on top of the 
world and that he is the one who can guide

171
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,259
the whole world and who can manage this and 
manage that.

172
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,830
For example, I cured a patient about ten days 
back.

173
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,250
I shouldn’t say, “I cured,” because 
it just happened that she got cured, through

174
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,250
Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,279
And she went to the hospital and the doctors 
saw her.

176
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,870
And they said, “No, it can’t be, how can 
you be cured?

177
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,100
How can you say you are cured?”

178
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
She said, “I am cured.

179
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
I have no pain, nothing.

180
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,440
I am perfectly alright and everything is functioning 
alright.”

181
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,940
“But how can it be?”

182
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:00,550
You see, not to accept anything comes from 
a fright that, if you accept something, if

183
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:10,550
you accept that there is Divine Power, then 
perhaps you may have no position, no significance.

184
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:16,320
So to be compassionate to people who get Realisation, 
you have to tell them that, “It is not that

185
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,279
you are overpowered by the ocean, but you 
become the ocean.

186
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,649
The drop becomes the ocean.

187
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,540
Not that the ocean overpowers you.”

188
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:35,519
Then it may be that you can go further with 
the second step where ego is little bit given

189
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,320
assurance that, “You won’t be finished.”

190
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:49,639
The infrastructure has this one problem that, 
ego has separated all your inner being into

191
00:15:49,639 --> 00:16:00,550
different parts and anything that ego says 
or is pampered, is good.

192
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:09,060
Good and ego’s happiness are regarded as 
equal to each other.

193
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:16,910
Now, if you can overcome that first hurdle 
with people, that you become the ocean, that

194
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:28,610
you become the guru, that you become empowered 
with your own powers, you have crossed some

195
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,769
areas in a personality.

196
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:34,949
And it’s a fact.

197
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,620
To begin with, it’s a fact.

198
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,380
But this area, actually, you get much later 
on.

199
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,110
But better to promise that highest, you see.

200
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,550
Like people promise that, “If you do this, 
you will get the Kingdom of Heaven.”

201
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,550
“Alright.

202
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,550
Then what we’ll get?”

203
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,450
“Then you will get the Kingdom of Europe.”

204
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,450
“Then?”

205
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,960
“Then you will get the Kingdom of England.”

206
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,840
And like that, you see, it moves.

207
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,460
But if you tell them that, “You will get 
the Kingdom of your own Self.”

208
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,070
They will say, “What’s there?”

209
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,680
“The Kingdom of your Self!

210
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,780
Such an insipid stuff?”

211
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,920
So you have to start from the big stuff, saying 
that, “You become your own guru.”

212
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,750
Which is a fact!

213
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,500
You do become your own guru.

214
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,150
But that happens much later.

215
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,850
But still if you tell them directly that, 
“You become your own guru.” first, it

216
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,750
will appeal to them.

217
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,810
They can start thinking immediately, “Alright, 
if we become the guru, we’ll start a big

218
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,810
cult, you see?

219
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,400
We’ll have a big cult, we’ll have so much.

220
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,630
I’ll also have Rolls-Royces, 58 Rolls-Royces 
and I can demand this and that.”

221
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,290
All these things may start working in the 
mind of a person.

222
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:09,130
Because the concept of a guru is also so nonsensical 
that it is not conceivable for people when

223
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,870
you tell them, “You’ll become your own 
guru.”

224
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,010
But if you tell them, “You’ll become your 
own guru,” they’ll feel happy.

225
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,242
And that’s the point you’ve missed I think 
John, the other day when you spoke, that,

226
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:21,590
“You will become your own guru, that you’ll 
become.”

227
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,090
But what does that mean?

228
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:32,850
Actually that means that your own religion 
within you, your Ten Commandments within you

229
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,070
will be enlightened; that you yourself will 
be correcting yourself all the time.

230
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,480
That means you will guide yourself.

231
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,730
Nobody else has to guide you.

232
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,180
You yourself will guide yourself.

233
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
It means that.

234
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:54,870
That you will have such a willpower that you 
will keep to righteousness, to correct living,

235
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:02,830
to normal behaviours, to the middle path of 
life, to be compassionate, to be loving, to

236
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:10,350
be honest and [that] all those things will 
come to you automatically.

237
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,941
That you will give up all your bad habits.

238
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:18,680
“You will become your own guru,” means 
that.

239
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,860
And that is what when you tell them before, 
it would be dangerous.

240
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,320
So, I would say that, first of all, if you 
have to say in a way that, “You will become

241
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,390
your own guru,” it should not be very much 
discussed and talked to people about.

242
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:45,760
But [it] is a fact that, once our own Void 
or our own religion within us, sustenance

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,570
power, becomes enlightened, if you see the 
light of that, then you enjoy that light,

244
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,170
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your righteousness.

245
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,830
And that righteousness when you start enjoying 
it, you stick on to that.

246
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,430
But that happens later on.

247
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:10,070
The problem is [at] first only [what] you 
feel is tingling or maybe cool breeze.

248
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:17,960
But this enlightenment of your sustenance 
happens later when you start enjoying your

249
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,190
virtues, enjoying the virtues of others, enjoying 
the righteousness.

250
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,820
And that is what is a difficult thing among 
human beings.

251
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:39,520
And because of this delayed action people 
don’t accept Sahaja Yoga.

252
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,530
Because they want everything in a very fast 
way.

253
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:52,110
If they could feel the joy of enjoying the 
virtues and the righteousness just then, then

254
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,920
they would not ask any questions.

255
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,960
But in the structure of man this comes later 
on.

256
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:09,160
Though you have to unravel that screw before 
but it is put back the last.

257
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:22,930
When the Kundalini rises in the Void it goes 
through this central-most channel called as

258
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,930
brahmanadi.

259
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:32,700
Is the central-most among the three nadis, 
channels, in the central channel.

260
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,920
The central channel is Sushumna and concentrically 
there are three channels placed and the inner-most

261
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
is brahmanadi.

262
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,080
The other two are called as Chitra and Charini.

263
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,430
Now the first one, it just goes like a single 
thread of hair and pierces through the fontanel

264
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,000
bone area.

265
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,550
Now one may say that, “Why not…”

266
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:10,250
You see we can blame God for this that, “Why 
not He had only one channel so that we could

267
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:15,600
feel the impact of Realisation very fast?”

268
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,410
But one has to understand that whatever God 
does is for our well-being and for our hita

269
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,980
and for our understanding.

270
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:32,450
If you go the other way round you see, that 
when we start hurting our central path of

271
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,970
Sushumna we start from outside.

272
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,410
Like, you see if you go to a wrong guru, to 
a cult or to a wrong thing where you bend

273
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:51,700
your head or you have faith in something that 
is artificial then the first channel is broken,

274
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,600
is hurt.

275
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:02,550
Now supposing if the whole of the Sushumna 
channel was made of only one tube-like channel,

276
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,350
then the whole thing would have been finished.

277
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:14,330
So, the first one, the outer-most is first 
attacked by our stupidity that we do – is

278
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,320
to bow to someone who is a fake person.

279
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,620
Or we go to things, we believe in things who 
is fake.

280
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:37,850
It is also harmed in the people who are very 
arrogant and think no end of themselves and

281
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,140
they think that, “We are the lord of the 
whole world.”

282
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,530
That, “We can teach everyone, and everybody 
else has just to learn from us!”

283
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:53,950
That, “We are the best sect or the best 
organisation or maybe the best religion or

284
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,840
‘the chosen ones’.”

285
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:07,890
Also there, first layer of the Charini is 
hurt.

286
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:15,760
So, at the very gross level it is first hit 
by these two types of people.

287
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:27,100
Now, the second one also can be hurt by people 
who practice all kinds of nonsensical things.

288
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:34,980
Like I have met many Sahaja Yogis who have 
been to all kinds of nonsensical things and

289
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:46,730
have practiced very perverted type of practices, 
very perverted, and all kinds of perverted

290
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,730
ideas.

291
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:55,600
Like, they will go to a cult – I have seen 
some people who have been to a cult, for example

292
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:02,120
– and there it is preached that you should 
not even look at your wife, or some sort of

293
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,740
a thing, nonsense.

294
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,760
And they are having relations with other women.

295
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,800
Like there’s another cult in India, I don’t 
know it is spreading here also perhaps, where

296
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,580
people believe that you should never get married 
and you should lead a very chaste life, you

297
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,710
should be virgins.

298
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,950
But the virgins have – what you call to 
men virgins in English language?

299
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,610
Oh whatever it is!

300
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,230
I don’t know if you have any.

301
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:37,820
But what you call them – men virgins, we 
call them brahmacharis and brahmacharinis.

302
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,000
So the brahmacharis, you see the men virgins 
– I don’t know if you have any cult like

303
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,670
that, but I think the priests are here like 
supposed to be brahmacharis.

304
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:52,450
So the brahmacharis and the brahmacharinis 
should lead a life of complete celibacy and

305
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,450
should not marry.

306
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,820
They should not marry.

307
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,760
Not that they should lead a life of celibacy.

308
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,520
They should not marry.

309
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:07,260
They should not marry, but there is no compulsion 
as to what sort of life you should lead!

310
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,650
Now, it is such a contrasting thing!

311
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,720
You should not marry for what?

312
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,470
For leading a celibate life.

313
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,220
And then with that what is the other contrast 
you have?

314
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,330
Is that you are leading a bad life with other 
people!

315
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,410
That’s allowed.

316
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,460
These kind of perversions when we have in 
life, or all kinds of perverted things we

317
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,580
are doing these days in modern times, all 
sorts of improper things, touches the second

318
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,590
nadi which is the Chitra.

319
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,470
I mean, I can’t even imagine!

320
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,330
I don’t know so many things what human beings 
do, to what extent.

321
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,240
But these are the buffer nadis outside.

322
00:26:49,240 --> 00:27:00,090
And that’s why there’s the very subtle 
one which is called as the brahmanadi is used

323
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,410
by Kundalini.

324
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:09,500
But first, to begin with, when She rises, 
She tests you and finds out what sort of an

325
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,120
ascent She’s going to have.

326
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,930
So, only a thread will rise first of all.

327
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:23,241
Because supposing if there is a hit on say 
five, six threads they are hurt and then they

328
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:27,670
become very weak and they fall down.

329
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:37,550
So, a very subtle, one thread we can say out 
of that, comes up to pierce the fontanel bone

330
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,550
area.

331
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,610
Now this is the structure within us, which 
does this.

332
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:50,860
Is done the same way as a seed sprouts or 
any living thing happens, like a flower becomes

333
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
a fruit.

334
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
It’s the same way.

335
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,940
It’s a living process.

336
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:04,390
So, when this one rises up and pierces the 
fontanel bone area, [at] that time, when there’s

337
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,480
a little touch with the All-pervading Power, 
which is subtle, by our subtlety you start

338
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,240
feeling this cool breeze in the hand.

339
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,410
But still there are two more nadis surrounding 
it which have to expand and get more of the

340
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,040
Kundalini coming up.

341
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,890
So now we cannot blame God for this kind of 
doing because He knows that human beings are

342
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,990
like this.

343
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:39,720
We try all the time to ruin ourselves, morning 
till evening, in every way possible.

344
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,790
Sometimes trying to please our ego or sometimes 
trying to please our superego – all our

345
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,790
conditionings.

346
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:56,270
First of all we never will accept any knowledge 
from anyone which is True Knowledge and we

347
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,020
always want to try ourselves.

348
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:09,520
Now anybody who talks to us with the authority, 
with that purity and with that holiness we

349
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
don’t like such a person.

350
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,340
We abhor!

351
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,210
But anybody who plays upon our weaknesses, 
upon our ego and superego, who is really harming

352
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:27,310
us and we are not aware that we are harmed 
by these things, we are not aware at all.

353
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:34,350
Like a person like Freud now: Freud must be 
a really [of] the category of Hitler.

354
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:39,850
Hitler was on a very gross level but Freud 
was a subtler one.

355
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,600
He has ruined human beings, absolutely!

356
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,050
You can see that in Kundalini, how he has 
ruined the innocence of people.

357
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:53,370
Their sense of shame, decency, decorum, which 
is a gross thing and by putting perversions

358
00:29:53,370 --> 00:30:02,090
into their heads now what we have are societies 
which are just like living like animals.

359
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:11,840
And this is what one has to realise that the 
people who talk about harming us we accept

360
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,960
them more than those who want to construct 
us.

361
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:27,350
Now those who want to construct us will definitely 
tell you that this is not the way it has to

362
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,350
happen.

363
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,230
Because if they have real concern and real 
worry about you, they are not bothered about

364
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,921
their cheap popularity, they are not bothered 
about pleasing you for anything, because there

365
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:47,240
is no gain as such, except for the satisfaction 
that you have told the Truth to people.

366
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:56,740
So this infrastructure that is within us, 
the more modern we become the worse it becomes.

367
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:06,590
And this infrastructure, if it gets spoiling 
more, and more, and more, then it is an impossible

368
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:14,610
task to communicate with them or to inform 
them of the Truth.

369
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,240
Though they might feel cool breeze in the 
hand, they might get the experience and all

370
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,350
that, but [it] doesn’t fit into their head.

371
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:29,400
I have known people who have done that way 
and sometimes it is amazing how thousands

372
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:38,500
get Realisation and very few remain into that 
state where they want to gain the deeper significance

373
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,460
of Sahaja Yoga.

374
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,050
Unless and until they get to the deeper significance 
of Sahaja Yoga, they are not going to accept

375
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,050
it.

376
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,430
They are not going to recognise it.

377
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:56,300
It’s a sad thing but it is so that, one 
has to touch the being very deeply because

378
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,870
it’s a beautiful being which is being ruined 
by various things, as I have described to

379
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,870
you.

380
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,100
There’s no end to it.

381
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:13,970
All these circumstances, keeping into view, 
one has to be very, very careful and compassionate

382
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:21,080
towards people who are seeking and who are 
coming, because these are seekers of the ancient

383
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,820
times they have been seeking.

384
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:31,360
Now, as the time has passed, of course, the 
communication of the Divine has improved,

385
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,280
definitely it has improved.

386
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,150
Because you have seen that we can give mass 
Realisation, people can get mass Realisation.

387
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,480
You have seen in India that it can happen.

388
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
So the communication from the Divine Power 
has improved, but the communication from the

389
00:32:49,120 --> 00:33:00,610
human power is reduced, reduced and also is 
very much wounded.

390
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:04,370
So if you see the Kundalini – I don’t 
know if you can see the Kundalini of some

391
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:10,340
people or most of you – you will be amazed 
that it is really a wounded Kundalini.

392
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:16,520
She has hit many points which has hurt Her.

393
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,960
Because you didn’t respect, you didn’t 
respect Her.

394
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,860
You did not know how to respect Her nor you 
could meet people who guided you properly

395
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:38,190
how to respect that special thing that God 
has given you, the special blessing of this

396
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,450
Kundalini which is within you.

397
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:52,020
Is the primule, is a very tender thing, is 
so beautiful, it is eternal within you which

398
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,330
has to rise and give you Realisation.

399
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:02,260
Now this is your Mother, which is waiting 
for an opportunity to give you your Realisation.

400
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:09,040
And this Mother has no way to come up because 
we have hurt the path through which She has

401
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,830
to come and She is also jarred.

402
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,409
I would say She is coiled like a tape within 
ourselves.

403
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:22,220
This is the structure of this Mother.

404
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,649
She is coiled in three-and-a-half coils and 
She has to rise.

405
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:46,260
Now think of a tape recorder which is put 
on a sea which is turbulent and sharks are

406
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,880
eating it off and then it is burnt – all 
sorts of things that can be used to damage

407
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,140
it have been done.

408
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,900
Still it is quite intact.

409
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,940
Of course there are little problems with it.

410
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,010
It is still quite powerful.

411
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:15,250
It is still expecting that great happening 
for which you are born, for which you are

412
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,910
seeking, for which you are on this Earth.

413
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,910
She’s there.

414
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:27,600
You can’t think of any human mechanism of 
that delicacy, that sensitivity, that beauty,

415
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,070
that understanding and that strength.

416
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:37,340
It’s hopeful against hopes.

417
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:46,840
And that is the thing still preserved there, 
because it is protected by your innocence

418
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,420
which is still there, little bit left.

419
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:58,010
You see whatever you may try with your innocence, 
as you cannot create a complete vacuum, you

420
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,150
cannot get rid of it the whole.

421
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:09,300
So whatever part is left of your innocence 
is guarding that and that essence is still

422
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,890
waiting, is there.

423
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,030
Whatever you might have done, whatever wrongs 
you might have done makes no difference because

424
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,500
Kundalini is intact.

425
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:29,360
But what is the problem is the other way round: 
that the mechanism of God is perfect.

426
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,240
The mechanism of Divine Power to give Realisation 
to thousands is absolutely in perfect state.

427
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,120
Absolutely, I can tell you.

428
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:49,740
But to make your brains understand the importance 
of your Self, of your being, of your purpose,

429
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:56,810
of your meaning, is difficult – because 
it is not integrated.

430
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,320
Your heart does not know your brain and whatever 
happens to your heart is not communicated

431
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,750
to your brain.

432
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:10,460
If you reasonably see certain things and logically 
see something happening, still your heart

433
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,880
may refuse if it’s a weak heart, if it has 
weaknesses.

434
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,220
But the Kundalini has the beauty to strengthen 
your heart, to strengthen your brain, to strengthen

435
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,870
your liver, to strengthen all your being, 
and to integrate it, but She must be given

436
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,230
a chance.

437
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,240
If you don’t give Her a chance, you are 
not fair to yourself.

438
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,730
People are fair to others but when are they 
going to be fair to themselves?

439
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:48,150
Ego is the not the way we are going to be 
fair to ourself because ego is a nonsensical

440
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,040
horse on which we are sitting.

441
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,910
It’s like John Gilpin’s horse which takes 
you round and round the places reaches you

442
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,960
nowhere for your wedding day.

443
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,020
It’s that kind of a nonsense.

444
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:07,330
So if you are playing with John Gilpin’s 
horse and if you are satisfied with it and

445
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,460
you think it’s a big fun, we are harming 
ourselves.

446
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:22,500
So to get to the real point is that to understand 
what is our infrastructure.

447
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,810
The outside one is alright.

448
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,780
We import things in India.

449
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:36,270
We can import anything for India but we cannot 
take it to the villages, we have no way to

450
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,400
there, there’s no road.

451
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:50,610
So that structure within us has to be built-in 
with our own coordination and cooperation.

452
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,070
We have to cooperate with it.

453
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:03,680
As God has taken all the care to build in 
the structure without, outside you, and also

454
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,680
inside you He placed nice thing, and you were 
the trustee of that, you were in charge of

455
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,690
that, but it is spoilt.

456
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:19,960
So you must give time for this inner structure 
to come up.

457
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,780
Now some people are unnecessarily frightened 
also.

458
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:30,610
I have seen some people frightened of I don’t 
know what.

459
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:38,830
Sometimes I think that we are frightened of 
too much of purity or of holiness or they

460
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,400
are frightened of anything.

461
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:49,210
For such people I would say they should read 
God’s words about it, that you should not

462
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,260
be frightened.

463
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:58,299
He is compassion, He is love and these things 
are there.

464
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:02,330
These are not the words of somebody who is 
giving you a sermon.

465
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,490
I am telling you the Truth.

466
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,800
It is there.

467
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,780
But you have to come up to that point to feel 
that beauty of that Truth, to enjoy that Truth.

468
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,830
And once you start enjoying that Truth then 
there’s no problem for Me.

469
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:22,970
There are some here sitting, quite a lot of 
them, who have felt that way.

470
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:31,280
But you have to have understanding that the 
inner structure is still to be rebuilt and

471
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:39,050
completely integrated and for this you have 
to give some time to yourself, some patience

472
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,080
to yourself and some compassion.

473
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,060
Not to be frustrated, disgusted with yourself.

474
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,760
Some cases have been very difficult, I know.

475
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
It’s impossible!

476
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,910
I have to be very strict with them, I have 
to thrash them, do all kinds of things, but

477
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,710
still there are cases which are to be thrashed 
out, doesn’t matter.

478
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,380
We’ll work it together.

479
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,540
Somehow, we’ll manage it.

480
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,350
Thrashing doesn’t mean real thrashing, but 
thrashing with love!

481
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,810
And all these things have worked out with 
so many, so why not with you?

482
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:18,730
But you have to know one thing that you are 
seekers of ancient times and this is the time

483
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,890
that was promised and this is the way you 
are going to get it.

484
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,810
There’s no doubt about it and instead of 
doubting it, please have it.

485
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:34,140
Take it within yourself, allow it to permeate, 
work it out and see for yourself that the

486
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,550
power you have got is the power of God’s 
love.

487
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:44,010
May God bless you.

488
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,240
Thank you.

489
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,710
I would like to have some questions if you 
have any , will be a good idea.

490
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,070
Somebody should come here.

491
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,530
I mean sometimes you know, I can’t hear 
some of their languages!

492
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,580
I have a language problem.

493
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,650
(laughing)

494
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:10,080
Gavin can you come down here.

495
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:20,010
It’s only this lifetime I have learnt English 
language, otherwise I never knew that before.

496
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,900
Just anybody who wants to ask a question please 
ask, please.

497
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,900
Go ahead!

498
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,660
Not to be afraid of or frightened of anything.

499
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:45,730
This is a temple you are in.

500
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,960
No questions?

501
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,230
It’s very good.

502
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,500
Yes my child?

503
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,590
Seeker: ??

504
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,950
Shri Mataji: That’s true.

505
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:05,880
You see, to begin with you have to have your 
Realisation so that you get the light within

506
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,880
yourself.

507
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,400
But the light is not so clear-cut in the beginning, 
alright?

508
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,900
Then you have to have your chakras cleared 
out and you have to have your Kundalini up

509
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,720
there all the time, to feel the whole thing 
working out.

510
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,330
And for that we have certain suggestions for 
you, how to clear out.

511
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,860
Because you start feeling your chakras on 
your fingertips to begin with.

512
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,550
You see, you start feeling them.

513
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,960
So you know that supposing now this chakra 
is catching, for example.

514
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,940
Now in your case, this one is catching, alright?

515
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,810
Why, because you have a weak eyesight.

516
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:37,810
Seeker: What?

517
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,040
Shri Mataji: Weak eyesight.

518
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,070
If you have a weak eyesight, then the the 
cerebellum becomes weak at the back.

519
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,070
Alright?

520
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:52,280
Now how to get better eyesight, how to get 
that portion corrected, we have a particular

521
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
method by which we do.

522
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,990
You see, by light, you have to put the light 
here, then the sun’s rays you have to take

523
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:05,170
it in a particular way, and a little exercise 
is there which one has to do.

524
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:09,160
And you’ll be amazed, you may have to give 
up your spectacles very soon.

525
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,640
It’s like that.

526
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,920
What I am saying, that it is pertaining to 
all the chakras on both the sides, means left

527
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
and right.

528
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,410
Now the left side is the emotional side and 
the right side is the physical and the mental

529
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,410
side.

530
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,960
Now whatever are our problems on the Left 
side and the Right side, we have different

531
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,560
methods by which we can correct.

532
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,740
Now if one method doesn’t work out with 
you, maybe another may work out.

533
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,180
But it does work out.

534
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,710
As it is the upsurge of the Kundalini itself 
solves many problems.

535
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,970
Upsurge of the Kundalini.

536
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:48,330
So the best thing to keep your chakras clear 
is to first of all keep your heart clean,

537
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,330
you see.

538
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:55,460
You should keep your heart clean, means you 
should not allow bad thoughts to walk in.

539
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,070
Now how do we do that?

540
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,070
How to?

541
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,820
Because if you are at the point this one is, 
at thoughtless awareness point, then there

542
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,370
is no thought.

543
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:09,150
The first thing one has to do is to achieve 
that position when you are thoughtlessly aware,

544
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,640
and that’s not so difficult.

545
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,740
There are so many ways by which you just sustain 
that position.

546
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:20,540
First of all you jump out, absolutely you 
get the vibrations here, but then to put it

547
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,990
down here is important because unless and 
until the Kundalini is kept here the thoughts

548
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,090
start coming from all the sides and then you 
cannot work it out so well.

549
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,310
But it works so fast, you can’t imagine.

550
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:36,750
I have known people who were alcoholics, next 
day they just gave up, Next day just they

551
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,110
gave up.

552
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,560
There are people like that: ‘druggists and 
chemists’ I call them, and just one day

553
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,200
over, finished, over it

554
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,360
It can be like that.

555
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,460
So you see, depends on…But doesn’t matter, 
not to get disgusted with yourself.

556
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,590
You must love yourself, that’s the main 
point is.

557
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,630
That if you love yourself as I love you and 
I’m bothered about you, it will work out.

558
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,330
It will work out.

559
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,300
Seeker: So love is important for us.

560
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,420
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

561
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,720
Seeker: You have to love?

562
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,280
Shri Mataji: You have to…?

563
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,320
Seeker: You have to love yourself?

564
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,700
Shri Mataji: Yes, you have to love yourself.

565
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,730
And in love, we don’t try to harm ourselves.

566
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:21,730
A mother who loves the child, she will also 
tell that, “Now don’t do this.

567
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:22,730
This is not good!”

568
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:26,620
Supposing the child is trying to put finger 
into some fire or something.

569
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,620
Isn’t it?

570
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,620
That’s what happens to you.

571
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,120
You start guiding yourself.

572
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,270
You just don’t do it.

573
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,270
It just happens to you.

574
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:41,370
You get that kind of a personality which does 
what is right, right for yourself.

575
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,780
And it is such a mutual thing, you see?

576
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,160
But you must have patience [is] what I’m 
trying to say there.

577
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,350
Don’t get impatient with yourself.

578
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,610
If you get impatient then love is decreased.

579
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,610
Seeker: Can’t hear you.

580
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,440
Shri Mataji: Love is decreased in you.

581
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,190
Alright?

582
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,940
So you have to have patience with yourself.

583
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,520
Because it may be, there might be some chakra 
is not clean as yet, may be, possibly.

584
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,330
But when we have cured people who were suffering, 
say from blood cancer, who are great Sahaja

585
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,330
Yogis today.

586
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,330
So why not you?

587
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:15,030
I mean, it’s very easy.

588
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,200
It has to be easy because it’s a living 
process, alright?

589
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,080
Seeker: But what I want to know is, is it 
all free?

590
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,220
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s all free (laughter).

591
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,840
Absolutely hundred percent.

592
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,600
Hundred percent.

593
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,990
Everything is absolutely free.

594
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,950
Seeker: But I myself ????.

595
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,090
Shri Mataji: You should!

596
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:47,140
Because you can imagine, if you love yourself, 
how much fees are you going to pay?

597
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,940
(laughing) See, this is that much absurd, 
to say to pay fees for love!

598
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,320
You can’t imagine a person who just loves 
you, just loves for love’s sake.

599
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,960
Can you think of someone?

600
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,160
In our concept we can have someone, maybe.

601
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,360
I think you had it in your concept otherwise 
I would not have been here!

602
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,680
There is no fees.

603
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,150
You don’t talk of fees.

604
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,170
Alright?

605
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,230
No question.

606
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,220
Everything is free.

607
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,290
All my love, everything.

608
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,710
I don’t know.

609
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,480
I don’t understand money.

610
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,480
You will be amazed.

611
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,730
I am hopelessly bad.

612
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,020
I just don’t understand.

613
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,130
I am so bad that I just don’t know anything.

614
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:36,460
If you ask me to cash one check in the bank, 
I’ll have to ask Gavin to write for me.

615
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,590
I really don’t know.

616
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,490
I just can’t learn about it, alright?

617
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,930
But love I know.

618
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,340
That I know very well.

619
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
And you will also know.

620
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,990
It’s absolutely free.

621
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,910
So just don’t worry on that point.

622
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,870
It has to be!

623
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:58,040
This air, what do we pay for it?

624
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
Nothing.

625
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:07,340
Now we have of course a place where people 
can stay and it’s quite a nice place.

626
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:13,190
And for your stay you have to pay about… 
they charge fifteen pounds per week, that’s

627
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,240
all, for staying in London.

628
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,270
Some nice place we have got.

629
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,920
Of course that, I will not pay for your stay 
there!

630
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,370
That’s what you have to pay for, if you 
are staying there, for your room where you

631
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,370
stay.

632
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,740
It’s a very nice place it’s a huge big 
place.

633
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,921
For that you have to pay fifteen pounds as 
rent for the room.

634
00:49:30,921 --> 00:49:31,921
That’s a different point.

635
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:36,100
But you don’t pay for my vibrations or for 
my knowledge or for anything.

636
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Alright?

637
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,100
It should be made clear-cut.

638
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:43,860
It doesn’t mean it’s a charity hospital 
where people can come and stay free, have

639
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,860
food free.

640
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,860
That’s not the point.

641
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:53,880
For your food and for your stay you have to 
pay.

642
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,869
Seeker: I understand.

643
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:59,200
The course and the instruction is all free.

644
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,450
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.

645
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,610
Not only, but all the attention your will 
have, free.

646
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,210
All the complete attention, absolutely free.

647
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,670
Is that clear now?

648
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,840
It’s amazing isn’t it.

649
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
but it is so.

650
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
Seeker: Yes, it’s amazing.

651
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,310
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so.

652
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,310
Alright.

653
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,310
What else?

654
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,310
It’s a good question he asked.

655
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,310
Very sweet question, you know.

656
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:18,310
Seeker: Is there a danger if you awaken the 
Kundalini?

657
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,530
Shri Mataji: Who says that?

658
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,100
Can I see the gentleman?

659
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,850
Seeker: It’s me.

660
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:32,510
Shri Mataji: Ah, alright.

661
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:35,420
Not at all.

662
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,420
You have read?

663
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,450
Seeker: Surely if it rises too fast?

664
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,840
Shri Mataji: You see these are the people 
who are naïve.

665
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,260
Not only that, but they are the people who 
do not know a word about Kundalini.

666
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,700
Now, here are so many people sitting here…

667
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:55,369
The Kundalini is your Mother, and awakening 
Her, how can there be a danger?

668
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:58,580
Will there be a danger if you have to sprout 
a seed?

669
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,690
It’s a living process.

670
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:01,730
How can there be a danger?

671
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:06,119
You see these are stupid people or these are 
unholy people, unauthorised.

672
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,110
They don’t know a word about Kundalini.

673
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,990
They try to put their hands onto wrong things, 
do all wrong things.

674
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,770
It can be a possession.

675
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,520
It can be anything.

676
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
They don’t know a word, they have no authority.

677
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,010
You have to have authority.

678
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,990
Divine authority should be there to raise 
the Kundalini.

679
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:27,230
Like the Mother Earth, if you put a seed in 
the Mother earth, it will sprout.

680
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:35,180
But supposing you open it and operate it and 
try to take out the primule, it will die.

681
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,190
Alright?

682
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,760
There’s no danger at all.

683
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,350
There’s no danger of any kind.

684
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,650
How can there be, it’s a living process.

685
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,130
Apart from that, it is your breakthrough.

686
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,580
It is your second birth.

687
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:56,360
Even when you were born, you never felt any 
pain, the mother had to go through.

688
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,360
That’s it.

689
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,600
You don’t have to feel anything.

690
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:03,880
Of course the other Sahaja Yogis might feel 
your chakras and might feel a little pain

691
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
here and there.

692
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,360
But it’s very little recording, to know 
where you have the pain.

693
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,670
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi, when you 
become an expert and you start giving Realisation,

694
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,660
then you will also know about it.

695
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:23,060
There is no danger of any kind at all.

696
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:31,908
Seeker: Are You saying that there’s no danger 
if it’s followed correctly when we awaken

697
00:52:31,908 --> 00:52:32,908
the Kundalini?

698
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:34,540
Shri Mataji: No you have to have Divine authority 
to awaken it.

699
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,640
It’s a living process as sprouting of the 
seed.

700
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,020
You understand my point?

701
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:46,900
So if you are ordained, not through any church 
or any temple or anything, but it’s a God’s

702
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,900
ordain.

703
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,050
Like, we can say, John the Baptist had that 
power when he came on this Earth.

704
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,180
And there were many in India who had this 
power, who are ordained, I should say, who

705
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:03,119
have a Divine Power within them flowing, who 
are capable of raising the Kundalini.

706
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,120
They do it without any trouble.

707
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,930
Even seeing them, you might get your rising.

708
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,500
You see from my photograph, Gavin has got 
Realisation; he got his Realisation from my

709
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,210
photograph, can you believe it?

710
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,100
From my photograph only.

711
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,100
So many got it from my photograph.

712
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,260
So it can happen.

713
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:31,370
It is a thing which is to be understood with 
proper patience, that God exists, and He has

714
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:37,010
His own methods, His laws, and the way He 
works out is dynamic.

715
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,210
Once you become that dynamic being, you will 
start seeing those working through your own

716
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,210
hands.

717
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,850
You do it.

718
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:52,220
Now in New York, two-three Sahaja Yogis cured 
a blood cancer patient and the patient went

719
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,220
out of the hospital.

720
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,650
I was not there, they cured.

721
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,180
They just cured a blood cancer.

722
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,850
You can do that yourself.

723
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,680
Yes, it is too fantastic isn’t it?

724
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,240
But it is.

725
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,400
It has been promised.

726
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,580
You see I was reading Koran and I was amazed 
that many-a-times it is: “The Day of Resurrection,

727
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,650
the knowledge will be given to you.”

728
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,480
“The day of resurrection you will know all 
about this mystery.”

729
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,100
All this was written in there and what are 
these Muslims doing now?

730
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,840
And what are the Christians doing?

731
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,400
And what are the Hindus doing? just tell me.

732
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,280
They are fighting over, whether they should 
play some music before the masjid (mosque)

733
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,720
or not, that’s all.

734
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,940
It’s stupid.

735
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:48,200
It’s all so gross that if you start thinking 
from that angle, I mean we really get lost,

736
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,850
we don’t know.

737
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,600
In the same way about Kundalini, those people 
who have written, I was amazed, a big book

738
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,000
like that you see was saying, “Kundalini 
is in the stomach.”

739
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,380
I said, “How can that be?”

740
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,380
It is not!

741
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,610
You can see with your naked eye sometimes.

742
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:09,820
I will show you if somebody has a big obstruction 
in the Nabhi Chakra, then you see it pulsating

743
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,480
nicely, this triangular bone, very nicely, 
clearly you can see.

744
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,640
You can see the movement of the Kundalini 
with your naked eyes.

745
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,440
You can see the piercing of it.

746
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,120
Absolutely without any harm to the person.

747
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,630
On the contrary, the one who gets Realisation 
never get’s any pain, that’s the worst

748
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:23,730
part of it.

749
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,970
I wish they could get a little bit to know 
that there is problem.

750
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,950
Only those who are giving Realisation get 
it a little bit, you know?

751
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,310
Like the mother gets the pain, in the way.

752
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:38,640
But not the ones who are getting it.

753
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,350
They don’t feel anything bad about it.

754
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:45,660
Supposing a madman comes here, you see, and 
sits here and he hits you, he doesn’t feel

755
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,640
anything that he’s hitting you or anything.

756
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,920
It’s only you feel that you are hit, it 
is like that.

757
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,470
Anybody comes with a problem here, we feel 
the little pain here and the little pain there,

758
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:59,740
but they don’t feel anything and we have 
to work it out on them and clear out because

759
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,440
who is the other?

760
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,150
They are within us.

761
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,660
To feel ourselves alright, we have to treat 
them.

762
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,090
And how can we pay for that?

763
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,190
For treating ourselves how can we pay?

764
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,190
Do you see this point?

765
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,210
Who is the other?

766
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:16,850
They are part and parcel of you.

767
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,600
Then you can’t take any money, you can’t 
grudge anything alright?

768
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,040
We have to grow.

769
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:28,170
It’s so simple as that.

770
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:33,300
Can’t believe it, isn’t it?

771
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,230
Because you have read too much about Kundalini 
I believe (laughing).

772
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:43,180
Actually, you see, these people have no authority 
to write.

773
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,300
But everybody can talk about God, about Kundalini, 
anything.

774
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,300
You see that’s the trouble.

775
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,020
Who is going to stop them?

776
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:53,000
There’s no legal control over them.

777
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,190
Anybody can say whatever they like.

778
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,740
They say about Christ anything.

779
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,670
I mean they write anything about anyone.

780
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,550
I am amazed to see all this, but what to do?

781
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:09,480
There’s no legal protection for God!

782
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,550
(laughing)

783
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:18,140
Any more question please?

784
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:24,280
There should be no fear of any kind.

785
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,270
The day has come for you to have Realisation.

786
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,150
You are going to get it.

787
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:37,680
Only what request I have to make, is that, 
even if you get Realisation today, just don’t

788
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,380
stop it at that point, that’s all.

789
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:49,590
You have to go further with it to correct 
yourself fully, to be the master.

790
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:55,900
This is one thing you have to promise yourself.

791
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,590
Because we’ll work very hard, and we’ll 
do anything that is possible, everything that

792
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,730
is to be done, we’ll really work very hard.

793
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,570
And it will be brought out, you will feel 
your Realisation.

794
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:18,730
But I have to make [a] very humble request, 
that you should not very speedily stop coming

795
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,250
and think that, “Oh, now I’ve got Realisation, 
finished.”

796
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,390
No it’s not that.

797
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:23,390
Alright?

798
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:28,119
That’s something people feel, because sometimes 
they feel so elated at the first thing that

799
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,740
they think, “Oh, now we’ve got Realisation, 
finished,” and then after one year they

800
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,369
come down with some sort of a problem.

801
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:36,070
That’s not good.

802
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,070
It grows slowly.

803
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:42,869
Sahaja Yoga itself has grown very slowly in 
this country, and has taken its roots now,

804
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:43,869
gradually.

805
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:47,520
And I am sure it will take its roots into 
the hearts of many.

806
00:58:47,520 --> 00:59:00,110
Because this is a special country according 
to my own understanding.

807
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:04,090
All the knowledge, everything is free, again 
I say.

808
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,090
Alright?

809
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,570
Now should we have Realisation?

810
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:09,850
Let’s have it.

811
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,850
Alright?

812
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:16,570
So, can you take you your shoes, will help 
you a little more.

813
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,960
You have to little bit coordinate because 
this Mother Earth, you know, she helps to

814
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,240
suck out lots of our problems.

815
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,750
You just take out your shoes, and I hope it’s 
not very cold down there for you people.

816
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:33,510
Just take out your shoes, that’s all, just 
to take out your shoes.

817
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,150
I find some very good people today.

818
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,740
There are some nice seekers.

819
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:46,390
Better to come in front, all those who have 
come for the first time is a good idea.

820
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:51,780
Please come forward, is a good idea to come 
forward.

821
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,780
Yes.

822
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,780
Not to have any apprehension, nothing.

823
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,730
It’s just you become because you are ready.

824
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:00,150
It’s like, as I said that an egg becomes 
a bird.

825
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,550
That’s what it happens.

826
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,100
Alright, very good.

827
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:13,130
Now we have to know that, as we have shown 
here, there are on these tips of our fingers,

828
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,530
first we feel the centres that are within 
us.

829
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,530
And these are seven centres.

830
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:23,960
This is the first centre, second, third, and 
then the fourth, fifth, sixth and the seventh.

831
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,730
No I’m sorry, sixth and the seventh.

832
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,520
These are the centres here.

833
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,020
Now these centres are seven, and these centres 
are seven.

834
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:41,359
These join together to form the central path, 
like this.

835
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,990
So the Left side and the Right side.

836
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:50,760
And to feel- I mean medically also they accept 
that the sympathetic nervous system is expressed

837
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,020
on the fingertips, that’s all, they have 
reached to that point and they accept that.

838
01:00:55,020 --> 01:01:06,510
So when you put your hands towards me like 
this, just like this…

839
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:11,390
And close your eyes…

840
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:16,260
Just close your eyes.

841
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:26,960
Keep your eyes shut, for one reason that, 
when the Kundalini rises above Agya Chakra,

842
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:36,680
that is where my red mark is, then the pupils 
get dilated so, if your eyes are not closed

843
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,210
then the Kundalini doesn’t rise above that.

844
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:52,680
So better keep the eyes shut for the Kundalinis 
to rise above that centre, just.
