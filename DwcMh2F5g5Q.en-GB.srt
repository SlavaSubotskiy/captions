1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,100
That, the central one [channel] is the sustaining
power, means is the power by which we evolve

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:17,185
that means we get our sustenance as it is.
This sustenance that we have got as a human

3
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:22,820
being, when it is to be manifested on the
five elements that we have within ourselves,

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:33,679
the source is there, but we have to reach
it through its different elements. When this

5
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:43,940
interchange takes place or we can say when
we have to put this force outside, that is

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,730
to be done through establishment of dharma
on these.

7
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,969
Like a superimposition or you can say the
connection. Like you can say, say there is

8
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:03,485
sun. Sun is 
the source of light and the source of light

9
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:14,340
has come to this earth which is created out
of the five elements. So the sun's rays have

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:24,460
to come. But when they come inside, in this
move, what do they do ? They enlighten this

11
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,500
world. But it's only possible if there is
Dharma, means the light is there, the rays

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:42,670
are there. The rays can be obstructed by many
things. If the rays are obstructed, then there

13
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:53,300
is a-dharma. So the source of dharma, the
spreading of dharma and ultimately the manifestation

14
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:14,349
onto the five elements is a complete thing
that is Void. This play goes on within us.

15
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:26,099
Our evolutionary power which has worked from
the very beginning, from matter, when the

16
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:44,760
matter got itself organized then we had carbon
as tetravalent, then from carbon the life

17
00:02:44,760 --> 00:03:08,349
started, all this is 

18
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:28,409
the work of the sustaining force. Then we
became human beings.

19
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:55,220
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which
we have to keep alright. These are the main

20
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:17,200
ten commandments. These ten commandments we
have to look after. And these are looked after

21
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:33,840
by the people who are the primordial masters,
as you call them 'incarnations' like Raja

22
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:59,760
Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates, like Nanaka,
the last one was the Shirdi Sai Nath. This

23
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:21,479
is the principle is there, is the primordial
master. Now, there is another principle that

24
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:39,850
is in there by which you receive it, this
is called as the disciple principle, the primordial

25
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:55,569
disciple principle, represented by the moon
and the sun, presided by Buddha and Mahavira.

26
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:19,690
So, this disciple element if it 
is not in you, you cannot receive it. But

27
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:44,520
when you start getting, receiving it, this
dharma gets into you and then you become the

28
00:06:44,520 --> 00:07:18,120
guru. You become the guru when this is completely
sustained. It starts as a disciple and then

29
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:43,810
ends up as a Guru. This is the Void part within
us.

30
00:07:43,810 --> 00:08:14,939
First of all, as the human beings are, we
do not observe the first ten basic principles.

31
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:45,110
In this country for example, or in the West,
we have, we observe the five of them because

32
00:08:45,110 --> 00:09:15,110
of law. In the countries like India they observe
the rest five, because of their society. So

33
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:43,920
in anyway we are lacking some of them. Five
are missing here or five are missing there.

34
00:09:43,920 --> 00:10:23,550
This is 
the situation of the dharma today. The gurus

35
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:34,500
and the disciples they do this connection
and then the matter, which is created out

36
00:10:34,500 --> 00:11:16,230
of five elements, get vibrated. You can enlighten
the matter. When the dharma is complete you

37
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:38,360
can enlighten the matter. The rituals that
these people used which was called as siddhu

38
00:11:38,360 --> 00:12:28,639
dharmic rituals they call it dudharmic, these
are the deeds of dharma, is to worship, to

39
00:12:28,639 --> 00:13:00,420
do Puja and to pray to God and to do all these
things, prayer. All these things after some

40
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:22,410
time became absolutely dead in it, because
there was no Realized soul as a Guru and no

41
00:13:22,410 --> 00:14:01,010
Realized soul as a disciple. So it was just
a joke going on, you see. It has no meaning.

42
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:27,310
Supposing I tell somebody who is not Realized
to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.

43
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:40,980
[Apart...]
So this Void is so important because that

44
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:51,319
is 

45
00:14:51,319 --> 00:15:08,959
how you establish your receiving eggs in your
being, the five elements within you, meaning

46
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:33,529
the five elements that exist. In Sahaja Yoga
we try the other way round stuff [Apart...]

47
00:15:33,529 --> 00:16:05,029
Now, what to do? This dharma is all ruined.
It is. There is another way: all these elements

48
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:21,569
are represented in your chakras, different
chakras. So why not take the Kundalini through

49
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:27,610
these chakras and enlighten the elements themselves
? Even there is no Dharma in a person you

50
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:41,290
can do it. But then the Kundalini goes back
to all the places which you have missed. But

51
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:59,690
if you have been to some guru and you have
bent your head before him, then the Kundalini

52
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,500
stops at a point. It doesn't move it goes
here, there. It just stops, it doesn't move,

53
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:14,000
very difficult. You have seen the Void pulsating
so badly. It just doesn't rise it always goes

54
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:31,110
back into that bottomless pit as you can call
it. It's always sucked into that again and

55
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:41,559
again if you have not a good... so we try
to remove the guru from your mind by so many

56
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:49,840
ways. Deny them completely, absolutely so
that they get out of your minds.

57
00:17:49,840 --> 00:18:02,920
And again raise the Kundalini and from the
innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it,

58
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:13,530
the innermost Nadi, the Sushumna Nadi, otherwise
you cannot reach there, from outside you go

59
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:27,950
on cleansing, cleansing, cleansing until you
reach there, you find you cannot pierce it.

60
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:37,409
But outside cleaning helps you in one way
that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi

61
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,299
that is in the center of Sushumna. If you-
there's less pressure then it is a wider one

62
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,380
so for Kundalini rising there is a better
chance.

63
00:18:47,380 --> 00:19:03,429
But in Sahaja Yoga, subtlest of subtlest Kundalini
we catch, and thread it microscopically inside

64
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:16,659
and take it out. And by taking it out what
happens ? These chakras definitely get enlightened,

65
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:28,570
they expand. That's how we expand the Sushumna.
Expending Brahmanadi. This was- this is the

66
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:42,559
trick of Sahaja Yoga. Because this cleansing
is going to take too much time as you say.

67
00:19:42,559 --> 00:20:01,260
The whole thing is to be cleansed out and
then it is to be released and then you have

68
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:12,870
to meet some guru who has to take it. So this
Sadhachar [virtue, correct action], whatever

69
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:23,590
Buddha has said, the right, the right action,
the right that he has said is the one that

70
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:38,130
is done. That's what it described. But that
doesn't work out with human beings, it's meant

71
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:55,990
for people who are realized souls. Most of
these religions are meant for realized souls,

72
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:06,380
you can find out. Actually realized souls
only took to religion before. Those who where

73
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:16,240
born again, Dwijah, Brahmins, who took to
religion. But the time has come for people

74
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:25,870
who are not realized also to take to religion
and to receive his blessings. Sahaja Yoga

75
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:39,570
is the only way one can do it, is to take
it in the suttle most-inner most Nadi, enlighten

76
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:49,409
every chakra, increase the size of the chakra,
pierce a little bit here, then again raise

77
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:59,440
another thread, then again the third thread,
like that, go on expanding.

78
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,460
Apart: This is it, you're alright ..
Better.

79
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:20,890
This is how it works out. In our case, I did
the same, I mean just talking to you.

80
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:45,029
Now the main thing about Void one has to remember
: there is no rationality. It's the hunger

81
00:22:45,029 --> 00:23:00,480
inside the stomach and hunger has no rationality
: if it is hungry it will eat. It has to eat,

82
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:15,600
no rationality can satisfy it : if you are
hungry, you're hungry. And when you have spiritual

83
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:25,830
hunger, the same hunger becomes subtler and
subtler ultimately it becomes the spiritual.

84
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:45,440
First the hunger starts of, say, food, of
primitive things. Then hunger for sex life,

85
00:23:45,440 --> 00:24:06,700
hunger for women, hunger for men, then for
power, then for money. Then the hunger for

86
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,230
spirituality starts.

87
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:26,940
When that hunger is concentrated and starts
rising without any rationality about it : you

88
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:54,510
don't know why you are seeking. Like Buddha
he had everything, he had a wife and his father

89
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:19,990
had provided him with everything. Still his
heart was seeking. Why was he seeking ? It's

90
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:38,260
the hunger that is not rationality, that isn't
explained.

91
00:25:38,260 --> 00:26:04,250
And then this hunger starts and the way we
quench that hunger is Dharma. The way we keep

92
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:40,760
it intact is the Dharma. Supposing you are
hungry: you go and eat some poison. Then it

93
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:59,440
is a-dharma. I know you are hungry but you
have to eat proper food. The knowledge about

94
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:14,570
that is Dharma : what food you must eat, what
book you must read, what people you must meet,

95
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:28,370
how you should live, what should be your attitude
towards others, others' things, other's wife,

96
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:43,299
children, daughters. Everything related to
the other, all that knowledge is Dharma. But

97
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:57,070
it has no rationality. Like, you see, a man
ran away- say- with somebody's daughter, he

98
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:10,220
would say: « What's wrong ? » I cannot answer.
I cannot answer. If a man has bad relations,

99
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:25,630
say, with his own mother. He says : « What's
wrong in this ? » You cannot answer, there's

100
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:50,850
no rationality. It is wrong, it's a fact : « Though
shall not commit adultery. » Christ has said

101
00:28:50,850 --> 00:29:09,340
even to have adulteress eyes is wrong. But
at the time, it was Christ who came. At the

102
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:25,250
Moses time people did not know this eyes business,
but Christ would see that and He had said

103
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:38,970
that « Those who have even adulteress eyes
are comiting the sin. »

104
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:59,909
So, how to deal with others ? Say, materialism
now : you are so attached to matter is also

105
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:15,659
problem with the Nabhi. Materialism is a false
identification with matter: all false [inaudible

106
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:45,380
word] with matter, with human beings, with
books, with all that is created is the problem

107
00:30:45,380 --> 00:31:04,710
of Nabhi so you can understand how important
it's now. And the one that prescribes it is

108
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:20,980
the Dharma, is the Guru. They did not come
like Gurus to convince you and argue out with

109
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:32,350
you, they said : « Thou shall not... » That's
the commandment. Commandment means there's

110
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:46,250
not to reason why. It's a commandment. There's
no rationality in Dharma. Now, the one who

111
00:31:46,250 --> 00:32:09,019
is dharmic does not think about sin at all.
Now, I'll tell you about myself, say, I go

112
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:40,570
to a party and they start a cabaret dance.
I do not think about it wether it is illegal

113
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:59,400
or wether it is wrong with this adharma, nothing.
I do not think but immediately I vomit. My

114
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:15,860
grand-children, you see, we one day were watching
the TV and three of them came vomitting. I

115
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:31,299
went and saw the TV and it was a horrid thing
going on. They just came and started vomitting.

116
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:40,330
There's no rationality about it : it is again
human sustenance. It is sub-human.

117
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:48,760
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth
we can. We feel horrible smell coming, but

118
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:58,000
those who work, say, in filth cannot feel
any smell. If you go near a factory where

119
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:20,540
sugar is produced you feel terrible there
get the smell of this molasses and you can't

120
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:56,700
bear it, but those who are working there,
are so much used to it that they cannot feel

121
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:13,960
it. Those who live in sin cannot feel the
sin after some times, they become insensitive.

122
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:37,680
But sin is a sin. So the insensitivity when
we develop within ourselves we become adharmic.

123
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:49,230
When we are sensitive about it we are dharmic.

124
00:35:49,230 --> 00:36:06,880
On the left hand side, the intuition about
it, the auspiciousness of it, is the thing

125
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:16,560
that one has to learn: auspisciouness. Houswife
is to be respected, honoured and comforted

126
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:25,550
because it is auspiscious. A wife has to be
respectable. A housewife doesn't- hum. It

127
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:33,680
doesn't look nice for a housewife, you see,
to be dressed in a funny way.

128
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:47,700
Once the chief cabinet secretary from India,
his wife had come and she used to think she's

129
00:36:47,700 --> 00:37:03,480
very young and smart or something. She was
wearing these tied jeans and things like that,

130
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:18,620
you see, and the poor husband, you see, looked
this side, that side. He didn't know what

131
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:29,880
to do, and she's, I mean -very big nonsense-
why ? And she came down in London, she was

132
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:42,410
thinking how she's great, smart, thin. And
they were invited to a dinner, you see, it's

133
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:52,320
real thing, you know, real thing that has
happened. And when this man was to go from

134
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:05,800
somewhere and she had to go from somewhere
else. So, when he went there, he said : « Where

135
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:18,520
is my wife ? » They said : « She hasn't
come yet. » He said : « No she was to come,

136
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:27,060
she's not like that, she's much smarter than
me, she must have arrived. » He looked around,

137
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:37,010
he couldn't find her. And there was a lady
standing, he said : « There your secretary

138
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:46,710
has come, she's standing there. » And he
didn't know what to say because she really

139
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:53,210
looked like a secretary and not his wife.

140
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:15,350
So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable
and she is to be respected. It's the part

141
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:37,820
of that auspisciousness. And the wife, that
essence of a wife is the governing so you

142
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:49,480
can imagine those women who stand for lib
and all that those who try to sort of say

143
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:59,250
that : « Why should we be respectable if
the husband is not, if he is carrying on with

144
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:09,340
other women I should also carry on with other
men. » You must know that you are being holding

145
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:18,640
that great position in the stomach, on the
left hand side of every human being. And that's

146
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:30,130
why the left Nabhi catches in England so much
and America, I think it's missing it already.

147
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:40,340
So, that is to ask to -- say - to a man, you
see, who is so developped, and so he thinks

148
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:51,960
no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization
where work is so important and money is even

149
00:40:51,960 --> 00:41:13,070
more important than work is, XX ? to think
that a housewife's respectability is so important

150
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:28,950
in the play of the universe? Yes it is. Where
the women become dis-repectable the whole,

151
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:41,460
you see, that's the breaking point of the
society. There the human beings will start

152
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:49,740
destroying. That's the real atomic bomb you've
got. But it is so, I cannot rationalize it,

153
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,510
it is made like that.

154
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:01,630
All the Gurus have said : « You should not
drink. » Even Moses. Every one of them have

155
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:11,660
said it : « You cannot drink. », means take
any kind of a alcohol or any things that will

156
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:25,040
take away your awareness because that is the
place of your awareness. In the sense that

157
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:42,570
whatever goes wrong here spoils your attention
and if your attention is spoiled your awareness

158
00:42:42,570 --> 00:43:06,800
is spoiled. The attention is here. The attention
is in the stomach, in the Void. So, how important

159
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:17,620
is your attention.
Wherever you put your attention, that works

160
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:36,730
out. When you are Realized, then your attention
is Realized. Wherever you put your attention

161
00:43:36,730 --> 00:44:07,850
it works like a spade, it works like a sword,
it works like a loving hand, it works like

162
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:49,650
kiss, it works like a comforting heart. It
is an enlightened attention in your stomach.

163
00:44:49,650 --> 00:45:34,130
You see the mother has a child in the stomach,
how it looks after the child, a little baby,

164
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:49,740
how it protects. All that is there, is given
to us through our Gurus, our own beings which

165
00:45:49,740 --> 00:46:03,800
are our masters, true teachers. The stomach
teaches you, your stomach is your Guru. Amoeba

166
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:25,740
became a human being through this stomach
only, through the hunger it had. If it did

167
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:41,800
not have hunger it would not have evolved.
And the hunger teaches you, and when you learn

168
00:46:41,800 --> 00:47:04,210
it properly then you become the Guru yourself
of the whole world and the universe.

169
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:12,940
Void, that' why, is very important and when
you have had bad gurus, you've read horrible

170
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:22,180
books, accepted them as facts and thruths,
then your Void gets spoiled, your attention

171
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:38,860
gets spoiled. It goes to wrong things. Attention,
when it works through your eyes, can also

172
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:57,200
go to wrong things. Everywhere wherever attention
moves, it can do wrong things if it is adharmic.

173
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:15,620
But as I said, there is no rationality about
it. Dharma is to be accepted. You cannot rationalize

174
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:36,650
it. To a point one can, but how far it harms
you, you cannot rationalize. Then the curse

175
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:46,340
of Divine comes on you.

176
00:48:46,340 --> 00:49:13,470
Any kind of fanaticism or identification with
one ideal- like Muslims thinking they are

177
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:48,261
Muslims- they're adharmic. They're not dharmic.
dharma is that you have to respect all the

178
00:49:48,261 --> 00:50:27,420
religions. It is a sin not to respect any
incarnation. It is a sin not to respect any

179
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:44,080
religion. And to identify with one, and denounce
of other.

180
00:50:44,080 --> 00:51:12,410
So, give up all these false dharmas and come
to that one dharma which evolves you, which

181
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:45,360
gives you light by which you can see the oneness
among all these religions. As I've said before,

182
00:51:45,360 --> 00:52:03,370
that 
they are like beautiful flowers on one tree,

183
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:30,160
nurtured by one sap, adorned by one tree,
but fools take the flowers out, say that these

184
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:57,930
are our flowers and kill them. And when these
flowers die, uglyness becomes the so-called

185
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,060
religions.

186
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:10,540
So, in essences, respect all the religions,
all the incarnations. Fanaticism is absolutely

187
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:36,220
against Nabhi and against the Void, because
the whole balance of your Void has to be kept.

188
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:56,440
In a very subtle and subtler form you'll be
sticking onto it.

189
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:14,240
Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever
you may try you can never get out of this

190
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:51,140
feeling that we are Christians. You'll have
much more respect for Mary in heart than for,

191
00:54:51,140 --> 00:55:41,380
say, Lakshmi. While, you are a Hindu, you
will have much more respect for Radha than

192
00:55:41,380 --> 00:56:04,790
for Mary. That will be lingering on and lingering
on.

193
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:21,600
When you develop that balance alright then
you are dharmic.

194
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:39,340
That balancing has to be done.
So one realization is within you like this

195
00:56:39,340 --> 00:57:07,700
and one realization is this way , among you.
and this is Dharma. Among all of you there

196
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:26,600
has to be another integration, a complete
integration of understanding. Whether you

197
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:42,010
are white, black or red. Whether a Hindu,
Christian or anything. You must know that

198
00:57:42,010 --> 00:58:03,420
there is only one way that is the living way
of evolution and that there is only one God.

199
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:16,010
And all of them [Incarnations] are aspects
of the same God, and there is no quarelling

200
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:23,670
among them.
Why are you quarelling ? This goes against

201
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:38,410
the Void.
Complete integration works out in the stomach.

202
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:55,820
And when you are completely integrated, you'll
be surprised, rationality drops out. Automatically

203
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:08,220
it drops out. Rationality kills this integration,
because if your heart says something rationality

204
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:24,220
says : « No, it's not right. ». But, if
you take out your rationality there and just

205
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:45,610
see for yourself, then wisdom comes in and
you just do it whatever is wise and good for

206
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:50,740
your spirituality.
Apart :

207
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,470
How are you now ?
Better

208
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:16,170
So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways.
First of all, we have to first of all see

209
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:35,130
the Void of a person, how he has got the Void.
You can see it, very easily because it might

210
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:56,630
be pulsating. Maybe not be in your presence,
I don't know, but in My presence it does.

211
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:15,860
But immediately you can feel the Void. The
Void you feel here, on the here or on here.

212
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:37,380
Now, just see these are the bases of all the
chakras. You feel the Void here, or here.

213
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:49,490
Bases of all the chakras you can feel, so
you can understand how important is the Void.

214
01:01:49,490 --> 01:02:00,630
Now, if it is catching here anywhere or catching
here, then you have to ask the person about

215
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:10,510
these various points : whether he's a materialist,
whether he is a fanatic. But these questions

216
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:35,340
you cannot ask out directly like say : "Are
you a fanatic ? You hit me hard. "

217
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:45,790
[Laughters]
Not to be very, very clever about it. Now

218
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:57,480
how to ask a person whether you are a fanatic
or not ? Very easy. Say, he's a Muslim. So,

219
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:06,170
you just ask him to put your hand, saying
that : « Should I put some Kumkum on your

220
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:18,180
head ? » His fanaticism will come out immediately
: « I can't do this ! » If he is a Christian,

221
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:28,160
then you just ask him : « Can you put a Swastika
on your head ? » Cross he'll accept. Swastika

222
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:57,590
: « No, I'm not Hitler ! » That's how you
can make it out whether he's open minded or

223
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:14,640
not by suggesting things like this, you see.
So then he comes out with his fanaticism.

224
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:28,800
Then what do you do ? You do not condemn him
as a fanatic, no. That won't be Sahaja style.

225
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:39,270
You say : « Alright, alright, I've got it.
The cross, would that be alright ? Alright,

226
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:50,960
take the cross. So, if I say that cross was
first Swastika then it became cross, will

227
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,270
you be angry ? » Gradually it will work out.

228
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:00,970
33:03
But if he's a fanatic, you go outside and

229
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:13,500
tell Muhammad to be him nicely. He will do
the job. Shoebeating is very necessary for

230
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,540
all fanatics. Nice shoebeat. But fanatics
are one of the most difficult persons.

231
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,540
33:25

232
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:25,920
Then those who have been to other gurus also
will be showing up. These days you don't get

233
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:33,040
fanatics so many to come to Sahaja Yoga. Mostly
they are guru beaten. You see there are [frocks?]

234
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:42,340
beaten people, there are guru beaten also.
I mean, mostly they are guru beaten. [Laughters]

235
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:50,810
Then you ask them : « Have you been to a
guru ? What your guru has done ? This, that.

236
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:56,270
» If you tell them sometimes they can be
fanatically attached to their gurus. Then

237
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:05,510
they migh be angry. They'll do it, but what
to do ? It is sometimes-

238
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:30,460
It 's the food ?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes It is....

239
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,180
It's good they are lookin after the food very
nicely

240
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:37,380
[Laughters]
Otherwise if you have to cook also then all

241
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:45,950
your attention is there. So it's much better
that your ashram. [Laughters]

242
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,940
No headache, nothing, your are having a nice
time here and their food is ready, now serve,

243
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,300
come along, have your food. So, the right
time we are talking about Void. [Laughters]

244
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,750
I'll sit here .
Sahaja Yogi: .. the Nabhi satisfied

245
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:59,010
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic
and every thing.

246
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:03,020
Good. How are you now? Better?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes

247
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:05,860
Shri Mataji: How are you now?
[interruption of recording during the meal]

248
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:11,230
It's such a wide subject that I cannot cover
it in one lecture, you coud write many books,

249
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:16,440
but the most important thing about Void is
that, that once you are enlightened you become

250
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,440
dharmic yourself. The Dharma starts flowing
through your hands. These vibrations have

251
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,600
a capacity to establish Dharma. So, when you
put your hands now towards the five elements.

252
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,450
Say you put your hands towards the water or
you put your hand in the water. The water

253
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,640
gets enlighted, vibrated, but if somebody
takes that water it will establish Dharma

254
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,030
into that person. Supposing somebody is a
drunkard, now you put this vibrated water

255
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,410
to him, give him to drink. He feels nauseated
after drinks. He'll throw away the drinks,

256
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,840
then he will stop.

257
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:39,370
Some of you have noticed that when you came
to Me first you felt terrible nausea within

258
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:48,340
you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes
you felt uneasy, you see. So these vibrations

259
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:53,420
through the water now pass into your stomach
and they establish dharma there, the proper

260
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:58,020
relationship. It so happens that if you go
on taking this water the right-side is that

261
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:08,040
physically you feel alright and the water
can give you such a power, that you can never

262
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:27,720
get cancer of the stomach, cannot get any
trouble with the stomach. But left-side side,

263
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:49,350
which has greater power, this water, that
it cleanses you, your sins - and puts your

264
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:55,330
attention, fixes it up on dharma.

265
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:56,440
So, your attention doesn't do- you're not
tempted, that's how you've seen people who

266
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,360
come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks easily.
Because it turns your attention towards dharma,

267
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:06,740
then if you want to take drinks, you just
don't feel like after some times. You feel

268
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:13,310
like vomiting, you feel like headache and
all that. And it happens so easily. Now we

269
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:31,620
know somebody here he gave up all his drinking
in no time. Otherwise it's not possible to

270
01:09:31,620 --> 01:10:01,230
do that, but because of this happening in
the stomach, now you cannot drink.

271
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:08,550
Just imagine. This is the great thing about
Void is that once you are enlightened you

272
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:14,750
can give something to the nature. You have
been drawing everything from nature so far.

273
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:28,630
First time now you start giving something
to the nature. And what you give to the nature

274
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:36,362
is so nourrishing to it also. Supposing you
give vibrations to, say, fruits, or to trees,

275
01:10:36,362 --> 01:10:38,760
or to flowers. You will find they will be
ten times more, the growth will be much more,

276
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:43,560
they will be lustrous. And they will be very
juicy, very tasty and the whole atmosphere

277
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,897
will be different. Maybe after sometimes these
trees if they will be standing there everybody

278
01:10:45,897 --> 01:10:51,770
passing that way if he touches that tree they
will get the vibrations also.

279
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:52,770
So maybe a tree may become a curer, something
like that. All those waters and all that,

280
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:53,770
we talk of « curing water » are nothing
but vibrated waters. They are vibrated. So,

281
01:10:53,770 --> 01:11:01,870
if the vibrated water goes inside, you get
cured. So, this is on the left-hand side it

282
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,130
works that it establishes your religion within
you.

283
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:06,610
All the problems we have had is all completely
cleansed out by them. In the same way if you

284
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,278
enlighten a light now here. You have seen
so many times how you can enlighten a light.

285
01:11:08,278 --> 01:11:09,278
So it starts going, see, both are there but
this one is working a bit. That one also is

286
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:10,278
going a little bit but this one makes a X?
taking out the blackness. It is because it

287
01:11:10,278 --> 01:11:11,278
is enlightened. That is also enlightened,
now we also ?. But this one actually in the

288
01:11:11,278 --> 01:11:12,278
hand is taking away the- If you see these
lights you can feel they're like pulled out

289
01:11:12,278 --> 01:11:13,278
like this. As if, you see, the realized lights
are pulled out like this, straight.

290
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:14,278
And, I've been to some of these churches where
they have these lights and as soon as I enter

291
01:11:14,278 --> 01:11:15,278
these like they're all going like 'kakakakakak'.
It is interesting to see how they start suddenly

292
01:11:15,278 --> 01:11:16,278
glowing like that. But people do not notice
it because they do not understand why it has

293
01:11:16,278 --> 01:11:17,278
happened, but you can understand that. So,
if you put the light, enlightened light - Say,

294
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:18,278
yesterday, the other day, we had that Havana,
is the enlightened light. Havana we had made

295
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,278
it enlightened, Jagrut. Then whatever we put
into it, you see, our badhas, it burns whatever

296
01:11:19,278 --> 01:11:20,278
we wanted to burn away. What is the beauty
of fire is, that, say, if you have some mixed

297
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:21,278
up gold and you put into fire, you find the
gold will be separated and the filth or dirt

298
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:22,278
or whatever is inside, it will be separated.

299
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,278
So, this quality which is the right hand side
quality of the fire is becomes in the left

300
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:24,278
hand side is that when you go near such a
fire or you use such a fire or a light, then

301
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:25,278
what happens that whatever is unwanted in
you is burned away and you get the pure thing.

302
01:11:25,278 --> 01:11:26,278
So it purifies. Fire is a purifyer and it
is a melter, it melts your heart. This fire

303
01:11:26,278 --> 01:11:27,990
melts your heart and you feel the compassion.
So that's how every element can be enlightened

304
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,990
and this is the work done in that Void by
your Kundalini. Kundalini goes to various

305
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,990
places and She enlightens all these elements
in your stomach.

306
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,990
In the stomach the basic principle is of water.
The Void is covered with water, and in the

307
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:31,990
water there is salt and the salt is nothing
but is the Dharma. Is the Dharma, the salt.

308
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,990
That's why when we give you salt what happens
the salt that is vibrated goes and helps you

309
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:33,990
in the stomach. And salt shows it's own nature
there by absorbing all that is in you which

310
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,990
is, we can say, in the mobile there. A person
- supposing is, hum, has got a cancer of throat,

311
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:35,990
then he should take salt. If he has a right
hand side problem he should take sugar. So

312
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,071
these are the two qualities, you see, the
five of dharmas are done by salt and five

313
01:11:37,071 --> 01:11:38,071
by sugar. And these are the best solvants
in the world as you know. So, all these three

314
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,071
things put together water, then salt, and
the sugar, they solve the problem of the Void.

315
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:40,071
That's why we use these two things. If you
remember Christ has said that you are the

316
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:41,071
salt. That means you are the Gurus. Salt is
the Guru. That's why he said : « You are

317
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:42,071
the salt. » Because you are the Gurus. And
salt disolves into water. Water is the Dharma.

318
01:11:42,071 --> 01:11:43,071
They are the absorber, always have a water
of crytalization. The- it cannot without,

319
01:11:43,071 --> 01:11:44,071
the salt cannot exist without water. So, the
water and salt put together means the ocean.

320
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,071
So Void is the ocean within us. That's why
it is called as Sagar. That means all the

321
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:47,260
oceans of the world are in our stomach

322
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,870
43 :30
and if you want to hear them sometimes you

323
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:51,510
can put your thumb in My ears and you can
hear coming [as one sound...?] You can hear

324
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,510
it.

325
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,510
So this is all the times socially churned
and out of it comes out all that is good and

326
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,510
whatever is bad is burnt away or washed away
or made to -- whith the air -- it is made

327
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:55,510
to be swept off. So the air element is also
there, air element that we see all around.

328
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:56,510
[recording cut ]
So the vibrated air is a very important thing

329
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:57,510
and it helps a lot.
[recording cut]

330
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:58,510
So I've talked to you about all the [?] of
the fifth Akasha, the ether you can say. That

331
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:59,510
works out when you are a realized soul. Then
you, you also vibrate the Ether. That's how

332
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:00,510
our, mean, collective work is done, through
the Ether, you see. Now, supposing I want

333
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,510
that you should get a proper seat [or ?] or
something

334
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,510
Apart:
Alright, take a seat up there.

335
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,510
Anything materialistic you can say, [oh, my
chair is going down there, how is it ?] I

336
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:04,510
have to just worry about it, immediately it'll
go [order some set?] - [Shri Mataji snaps

337
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,510
her fingers] - Alright ? So, Saint Michael
and Saint Catherine, both of them say now

338
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,510
: « What should we do ? We must find out
a proper place. » So, they take down into

339
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,510
consideration. They bring him down here and
find out a nice [place?] Is all done through

340
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:08,510
Ether.

341
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,510
Ether, is the..., when it is enlightened,
you see, then it communicates the ideas, the

342
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,510
things that shall be done, or the desire,
divine desires are carried out. And then you

343
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:11,510
are placed in His hands sometimes you are
surprised : « How am I here ? How are you

344
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:12,510
here ? How do I meet you ? I mean, I was not
to come this side and then now how did I come

345
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,510
? » All these things can be done through
the Ether which -even we get our television

346
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,510
and everything through Ether. But on the television,
if the Ether, if you, say, enlighten then

347
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:15,510
it will so happen, that a bad [?] program
won't materialize. It won't materialize.

348
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:16,510
It can work very dynamically. You cannot imagine
how these miracles take place. And real miracles

349
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:17,510
are felt- of course we do feel the miracles
of all the other elements but it's not so

350
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,510
obvious as that of the Ether because you're
suddenly surprised : « How this... ? Why

351
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,510
? » And it's everybody's surprised at it
: « oh, here in the plane, you get all this.

352
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:20,510
» So, this is done by Ether and it is so
miraculous. It is so miraculous that it is

353
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,510
hard to believe that it is possible.

354
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,510
Now, this Ehter works day time and night time.
It doesn't take rest anywhere, you see. It's

355
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,510
all the time working for us, means it's all
the time ready to work out the divine work.

356
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:24,510
All the time it is ready to work out the divine
work. It doesn't wait. It doesn't wait for

357
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,510
anyone to give orders or anything, it's just,
just waiting there. As soon as it sees that

358
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:26,510
this is desired, alright, nothing is to be
told, just to desire and you'll say that : « Oh,

359
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:27,510
what will be happening to such and such person
? » Finished, it's done. It is being transmitted.

360
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:28,510
The same Ether that transmits the - what you
call ? - the air transmissions which you receive

361
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,510
on the radios, radio transmissions. The same
one, when enlightened, does all this job.

362
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,510
He works it out everything. Everything that
you want it works it out. And there's how

363
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,510
the angels show their [ Shri Mataji searches
the word in Marathi] miraculous feats. But

364
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,510
it is worth noticing all that and watching
it, and witnessing it and noting it down : « Oh,

365
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,510
how it helped and how it worked out ! »
It also, ether when enlightened, brings people

366
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,510
closer to divine power. It arranges how [?] But,
now, one would ask what is the necessity for

367
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:35,510
God to have such complicated methods of 'enlightening
the matter'? Why not it has already the enlightened

368
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:36,510
matter ? It's the question one should ask,
I mean, I'm asking as you people are there,

369
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:36,518
so I'm asking you. Let's see the answer.
