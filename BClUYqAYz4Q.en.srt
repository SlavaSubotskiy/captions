1
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,166
I’m very joyous today

2
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,000
to see all of you celebrating My Birthday,

3
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:40,834
as well as having the

4
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,083
national program same day.

5
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:50,083
It’s a good combination we have, in the month of March.

6
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:55,625
Is regarded as springtime in India – Madhumas,

7
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,959
that’s what you sing, Madhumas.

8
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,000
And as you know, twenty-first March is the equinox,

9
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,999
so it sort of is a balance,

10
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:19,917
and also the center of all the

11
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,999
signs you have in the horoscope.

12
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,875
So many centers I had to achieve,

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,125
and also I was born on

14
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:39,542
the Tropic of Cancer

15
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,250
as you are on the Tropic of Capricorn,

16
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:51,000
and Ayers Rock is on the Tropic of Capricorn,

17
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,583
just in the center.

18
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,875
So many combinations had to be worked out.

19
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:07,709
So the principle of ascent

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,375
is to be in the center,

21
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,333
to be in the balance,

22
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,834
to be in the maryadas of the center.

23
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,083
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,875
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

25
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,875
to the maryadas?

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,041
Then we get caught up.

27
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,417
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

28
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,583
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

29
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,875
Say we have the maryadas,

30
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:46,083
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

31
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:53,125
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

32
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,542
on all the sides of the void,

33
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:01,959
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

34
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,458
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

35
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:13,083
and to keep to the boundaries is difficult

36
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,625
when you have two problems:

37
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:18,458
one is the ego, another is the superego.

38
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,999
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

39
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,750
Ego is the problem, and it has very,

40
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,500
very subtle implications now,

41
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:32,750
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

42
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,917
One is a gross,

43
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,500
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

44
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,917
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

45
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:49,792
That one is the one,

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,709
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

47
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:03,250
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

48
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,083
then he behaves in this manner,

49
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,208
only that he doesn’t know

50
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,709
how to hide his ego in sophistication.

51
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,999
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

52
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,333
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

53
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,625
Like in English language we’ll say,

54
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:33,291
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

55
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,166
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

56
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,000
It’s such a devious thing,

57
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,000
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

58
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,709
that means you have put a chocolate

59
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,333
on top of that, isn’t it?

60
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,083
Such a camouflage, must understand.

61
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,083
See we must face as we are,

62
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,291
we cannot be facing something else.

63
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,208
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

64
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,250
that we avoid facing ourselves.

65
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,542
Today though the day is of celebration

66
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,834
so in all humor we should understand

67
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,083
what this stupid thing called ego is.

68
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,291
In all humor, not in seriousness,

69
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,000
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

70
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:31,000
Now as I was explaining in the morning

71
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,999
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

72
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,709
I mean even before going to the hall,

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,583
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

74
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,000
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,542
I mean all the time it has been there

76
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,750
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,750
It has never vanished.

78
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,083
So this chakra is all the time working,

79
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,625
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

80
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,667
So what happens really,

81
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,375
we should see the physical side of it,

82
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,750
it’s very important to understand.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,166
You see from childhood if we are taught

84
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,792
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

85
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,333
you have to achieve something,

86
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
some success or this and that,

87
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:21,125
then the idea of strength is given to you,

88
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:25,625
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

89
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:29,250
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

90
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,458
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

91
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,083
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

92
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:41,250
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

93
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:47,250
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

94
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,542
You can never be successful if you do like that.

95
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,792
So unless and until you are possessed

96
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,208
you can never be obedient.

97
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,083
This is what it is.

98
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,000
Somebody has to possess you,

99
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:04,500
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

100
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,834
then you can be obedient;

101
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,417
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

102
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,125
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

103
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,999
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

104
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,959
everybody wants to have their own way,

105
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,166
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

106
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,667
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

107
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,166
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

108
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:34,250
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

109
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,041
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

110
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,917
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

111
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,000
they become disobedient.

112
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:47,792
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

113
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,667
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,333
obedience is weakness.

115
00:08:55,875 --> 00:09:02,792
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

116
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:08,250
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

117
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,959
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

118
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,750
and all those things it does burst,

119
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,417
but it is flexible also.

120
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:22,542
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

121
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:28,125
superego, then the superego

122
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,959
can go up to a point, it is also there.

123
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,792
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

124
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,542
drugs just to push it back

125
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:50,583
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

126
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,750
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

127
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,583
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

128
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,709
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

129
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,750
Otherwise ego is too much.

130
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,208
So when somebody says something to you,

131
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,291
instead of facing up to it

132
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,333
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

133
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:23,083
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

134
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,041
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

135
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,333
Because there’s another place

136
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:35,291
where this ego can go is when you come round,

137
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,208
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

138
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,834
so when it is suppressed from the other side

139
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,792
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

140
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,583
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

141
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:54,000
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

142
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,041
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

143
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,250
and that’s how you sulk and think.

144
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,000
Think so you get more ego,

145
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:13,208
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

146
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,542
Now, the practical way

147
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:25,625
the central path is established by being in reality.

148
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,250
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

149
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,625
Supposing something has gone wrong,

150
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,333
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

151
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,000
because I’ve done the mistake.

152
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,792
All right, why did I do the mistake?

153
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,999
Because of this, so next time no.”

154
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,333
But very easy, avoid everything,

155
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,667
come to this and enjoy your ego feeling sad.

156
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,333
Is an indulgence.

157
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,667
And others also feel, “Oh, he’s felt

158
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,250
‘I’m sorry I’ve killed you,’ you see.

159
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,458
He feels sorry for it.”

160
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,250
Yes I’ve seen, it is gone so far

161
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,667
in the minds of the Western people

162
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,834
that there are laws which really forgive people

163
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,208
who should never be forgiven.

164
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,250
They also try to forgive people

165
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,458
because of this left nonsensical Vishuddhi

166
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:20,959
which indulges into the left side,

167
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,083
you feel sympathy for such people,

168
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,750
who should not have been forgiven.

169
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,999
Like there’s one fellow who has murdered so many people,

170
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,999
put them into gas chambers, this thing.

171
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,917
He’s arrested now, he’s a liability now,

172
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,333
big liability as a prisoner kept somewhere

173
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,792
because they had to keep everything very much closed,

174
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,999
and this and that.

175
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,583
So to maintain such a dog there

176
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,000
was very difficult for English people,

177
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,041
but they are maintaining this one prisoner.

178
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,959
I’ve forgotten his name, horrible fellow whosoever it is.

179
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,208
Now he has been there, he’s old, this thing

180
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,500
- let him die there, what is there to have pity?

181
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:58,417
Just hang him out and finish. He has killed so many people.

182
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,542
No, but how can you do that.

183
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,750
You must keep this doggy there

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,125
though he’s consuming the money of all the people,

185
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,875
though he has killed thousands and thousands

186
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,250
and thousands in gas chamber.

187
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:15,375
He’s been such a horrid fellow there should be no sympathy,

188
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,458
in the Divine Laws he would be finished in no time.

189
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,500
He’s dissipating every day,

190
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:25,083
but even now I read articles in sympathy with him.

191
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:29,500
“Now what is he going to do wrong? Why not leave him alone?”

192
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,500
This is how you play in to the hands

193
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:38,125
of horrible people by your Left Vishuddhi, first of all.

194
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,750
So this Left Vishuddhi is nothing but purely,

195
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,583
purely ego and then you bend your head like that,

196
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:48,375
you walk like this.

197
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,792
Now with this Left Vishuddhi though you have many,

198
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,208
many physical problems,

199
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,709
but the worst of all will be lunacy.

200
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,000
The other day somebody told Me that

201
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,000
at the age of forty years now in America,

202
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,792
people are suddenly becoming lunatic

203
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,125
and it’s a very big sickness,

204
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:18,250
just like they have it in

205
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,333
that horrible disease called AIDS,

206
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,792
in that way it is spreading.

207
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,834
Now I must tell you as your Mother, very clearly,

208
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:34,375
that this is the part this horrible Left Vishuddhi plays.

209
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,333
Do not indulge into it.

210
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,166
If you have an ego, that’s why it’s Left Vishuddhi,

211
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,583
face up to yourself.

212
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:47,542
Like today Warren’s idea was that he came and told Me that

213
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,333
“In India when we go, we think that

214
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:54,041
the people whatever we suggest first start with ‘No, no.’ ”

215
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,041
So you see actually that “No, no,”

216
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,208
is because we are brought up a different way,

217
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,333
you see - to face up to it, we are brought up to it.

218
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,208
That’s why Indians are never guilty.

219
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,959
If they are guilty know that they are westernized.

220
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,375
They’re never guilty.

221
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,917
So now at that time when they say, “No” to something,

222
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,917
ninety nine percent, not the people who are in the cities,

223
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,083
they are same style of (?)

224
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,875
because you have blessed them nicely, but in the villages.

225
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,375
You see they tell themselves,

226
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:25,917
“No, no, how I could have done it?

227
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,667
All right, if I have done it I better correct it.”

228
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,375
“No, no,” it starts with “No, no.”

229
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,291
But a Western person might hear this “No, no”

230
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,750
and he’ll think, “He’s just punching my ego.”

231
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:41,709
Because still that ego is there to dominate others,

232
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:46,083
still this ego thinks they are much better organizers,

233
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:50,000
still this one thinks they are cleaner people than others,

234
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,583
they are higher people than others.

235
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,542
All this ego thinks like that, you see,

236
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,166
and builds you up and you live on top, you see,

237
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,208
like a balloon or a ring that is bloated

238
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,125
you keep on the surface,

239
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,166
and that’s why don’t want the air to get out,

240
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,917
because you know, you'll sink into yourself.

241
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,250
So one lives on that

242
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,250
and you start thinking you know it better,

243
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,999
anybody says anything to you, one feels hurt,

244
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,959
again Left Vishuddhi.

245
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,625
If Mother says anything, again Left Vishuddhi.

246
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:31,375
So you have all ready made a pouch there being in the West;

247
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,000
we should face as we are.

248
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,083
Now that pouch is there so anything I say,

249
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,834
now even if I’m saying now, you should not feel guilty.

250
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,834
Let’s see, not feel guilty.

251
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,375
Be on your Spirit so you see yourself

252
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,875
and you can clear out.

253
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,750
If you see from your Spirit’s angle you clear out

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,333
that which you have been accumulating since long.

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,583
Left Vishuddhi is the problem today of the West I tell you.

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,625
All these problems are coming from Left Vishuddhi,

257
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:07,750
but which is not in no way is that they’re subdued,

258
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:11,083
on the contrary any moment

259
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:16,166
this Left Vishuddhi can blow in again into the ego.

260
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,166
You see, I’ve seen this in the West very common,

261
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,959
people are walking straight forward everything is all right.

262
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,458
Even in the cities of India we have seen it

263
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,041
- you make them into trustees,

264
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,625
suddenly they jump on the horse.

265
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,458
I said, “From where did they jump in the horse,

266
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:31,291
from where did this ego come?”

267
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,999
That was all stored up here you see,

268
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,542
as soon as they become trustees the whole thing comes back

269
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,417
and they are sitting like John Gilpin on a horse

270
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,709
going fast and I start looking at them,

271
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,333
where are they going?

272
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,542
They were just there, disappeared,

273
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,792
vanishing tricks.

274
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,667
Just can’t understand why it happens.

275
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:55,291
But after penetrating into the problems,

276
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,458
because I see just going to the hall

277
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,333
you get the Left Vishuddhi.

278
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,917
But look at the children,

279
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,125
you see from childhood you don’t teach them

280
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,000
all the time say, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

281
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,709
Our Parsees in India

282
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,709
have very much affectation from you, very much.

283
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,041
So in the morning we never want to see a Parsee

284
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:18,291
because early in the morning he’ll come and start saying,

285
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:21,999
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” This is inauspicious.

286
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,625
“Maafkaro, Maafkaro,” you see people say,

287
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,999
“Baba, you come in the afternoon, this is not the time,

288
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,417
morning time don’t start with this.”

289
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,125
We don’t say like this, is inauspicious.

290
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:35,917
You open the door somebody standing,

291
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,792
“Maafkaro,” for what, what have I done?

292
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,959
What have you done that you are saying like this,

293
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,250
all the time in an apologetic mood you see, for what?

294
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,667
You see, you don’t want to see an apologetic face

295
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,041
in the morning time do you?

296
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,041
Something pleasant, nice coming to greet you, here this

297
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:56,875
“Maafkaro, maafkaro, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

298
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,166
It’s a very common thing

299
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,999
that we don’t want to see a Parsee in the morning,

300
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,000
the reason is this: you see, if you see them in the morning

301
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,583
the whole day you are in a bad state,

302
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,250
you have seen somebody apologetic.

303
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,125
But it is not apology, they are extremely egotistical people.

304
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,709
If you study their character, they’re very egotistical.

305
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,375
So this one has to understand:

306
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:26,041
that when we start dealing with our ego

307
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,083
we, must directly deal with it.

308
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,625
We are not ego, we are the Spirit. Directly.

309
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:37,125
“Oh I see. So it was wrong, so it was done by not me,

310
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,333
by this body, now come along, no, no, better be all right.”

311
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,417
You tell yourself, “No, no better be all right.”

312
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,959
That’s how we are going to deal with it,

313
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,834
because you see this is what is frightening Me

314
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,667
is this Left Vishuddhi.

315
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because when I thought of this disease,

316
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,291
My attention went to Left Vishuddhi.

317
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,125
Imagine people becoming lunatic.

318
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,291
And most of the egotistical people I find

319
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,959
become stupid because of that.

320
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,000
They are stupid, they behave stupidly, they behave stupidly.

321
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,125
And the egotistical people only take to drugs

322
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,834
and to drink so much because they can stand it.

323
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,709
Supposing a person who is very superego,

324
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,333
supposing a man who is possessed takes to drinks,

325
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,291
he’ll die very soon, he won’t live

326
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,792
because he’s thrown more that side.

327
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,375
But the egotistical people can stand, I mean,

328
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,999
a person who is not egotistical, like an Indian

329
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,834
if he takes a vodka he’ll be blown off the shores,

330
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,041
absolutely, nowhere to be found, lost.

331
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:43,291
Even in lost and found he won’t be there.

332
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,792
But it’s that ego of yours that has resistance

333
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,834
for the superego

334
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,500
and that’s how you manage it.

335
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,041
You see that’s why people can drink,

336
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,999
it has nothing to do with the cold weather or anything

337
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,333
it’s more your ego.

338
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:05,583
Now when you call also left sided

339
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:08,083
sometimes you make a big mistake.

340
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,500
You are not.

341
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,667
You live with that myth

342
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,375
because that’s how you can excuse your ego.

343
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,625
Because basically Western people are egotistical.

344
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,041
We must accept this fact.

345
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,750
We are not Western people, we belong to the realm of God,

346
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,333
so don’t feel guilty.

347
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,500
You are no more Western, to Me you are neither Indian,

348
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,959
nor English nor Australians, you are My children.

349
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,750
But some of these things are hanging around,

350
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,875
so you be careful what I am telling you,

351
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,208
this will happen to all of you in a little way but not much.

352
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,375
So be careful, it is outside,

353
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:02,750
outside the mariadas where you little bit get out, you find.

354
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,709
So those who think also who are left-sided,

355
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,417
are only possessed people, because they’re possessed,

356
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,500
that’s why they become left-sided,

357
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,875
otherwise they’re not, by temperament they’re not,

358
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,458
because there’s no tradition,

359
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,792
there’s no conditioning accepted, nothing,

360
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,667
there has been no conditioning on them of any kind.

361
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:27,375
So there are hardly to be found any tamasikas in the West,

362
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,667
hardly to be found.

363
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,458
So what do we have are the people

364
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,417
who are egotistical but get possessed.

365
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:38,375
So these possessions take charge of your ego,

366
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:39,875
and they work through your ego,

367
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,166
so they are much more dangerous than the ordinary tamasikas.

368
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,792
You see an ordinary tamasikas who even gets possessed,

369
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:51,166
he dies very soon; otherwise he just, he troubles himself.

370
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,375
He gets body pains, he gets all those troubles himself.

371
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,917
But when a person who is egoistical is also possessed,

372
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,417
then he becomes a troublesome person.

373
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,083
In India if people drink you’ll be surprised

374
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,750
they become very nice people, extremely mild,

375
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,125
very quiet, very good.

376
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,125
I mean some women told Me,

377
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,417
“We want them to drink because they’re better.”

378
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,000
But not here, they become violent, why?

379
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,750
Because there is already the base for the ego

380
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,667
and these fellows who jump in from the left side

381
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:33,542
or right side whatever it is take over the ego.

382
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,667
And they work through the ego then,

383
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,917
so such people become cruel, assertive.

384
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,792
I mean, all Germans were dealt like that.

385
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,667
They were all possessed by supraconscious bhoots

386
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,041
and they all behaved in this atrocious manner.

387
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,291
Imagine any human being, human being,

388
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:58,500
killing millions of people with the gas chamber.

389
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,667
Can you think of it?

390
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,875
I mean, you can’t even see

391
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,834
a little chicken being cut in your presence.

392
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:08,333
How can you see so many people just there,

393
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,000
being gassed before you,

394
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,083
trying to get out of the gas chambers?

395
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:16,166
And they were all transparent so you could see them.

396
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,083
See the cruelty to which they could go. How?

397
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:24,750
They were possessed, and possessed by egoistical temperament.

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,917
So these bhoots also used their ego and did it.

399
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,792
So we are in the center,

400
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,709
we are the people who have ascended to God’s level;

401
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,709
we have no business to have Left Vishuddhi on any point.

402
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:49,583
We have no ego. Where is the ego? It’s finished.

403
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:52,417
Where is the superego? Finished.

404
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,500
So if there is even a lurking thing of that,

405
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:59,667
you just face up to it. Why do you feel guilty?

406
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,542
For what?

407
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,417
Nonsense?

408
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,583
And that’s how you get rid of it.

409
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,834
Because I have seen with Sahaja Yogis also

410
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:12,375
suddenly their nose will blow out, their eyes will come out,

411
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,041
suddenly they’ll talk like this and I get a fright.

412
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,667
I said, “What’s the matter? He was a normal person,

413
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,208
why is he talking like this now?”

414
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:24,583
The reason is that hidden ego suddenly jumps out and shows.

415
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,083
It’s with many Indians also,

416
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,375
those who are city dwellers are horribly egoistical,

417
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,041
you have blessed them, as I told you,

418
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,750
so they also behave in the same manner.

419
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,500
But because there is tradition of keeping in the center

420
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:41,125
in any country, like China has the same.

421
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:44,291
I’ve seen, China has the same.

422
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,375
I haven’t seen they ever say,

423
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:50,417
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

424
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,959
And they don’t even discuss.

425
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,291
The Russians have been so bad to them.

426
00:25:57,709 --> 00:25:59,667
“It’s all right,” we tell them. We ask them,

427
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,000
“Why did you cut off from the Russians?” “Forget it.”

428
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,000
They never criticize, sit down and criticize,

429
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,458
“They did like this,” or sulk about it or think about, nothing.

430
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,999
Like Indians, now you will be surprised,

431
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,291
we have a law that we are not supposed

432
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:17,875
to make any films against the English. Can you imagine?

433
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,500
Because they left our country in grace.

434
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,208
Even Shivaji’s pictures are not allowed

435
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,291
because maybe it will show that the Muslims are bad,

436
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,250
to that extent we go.

437
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:36,500
Because forget it, forget it, forget it,

438
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,792
when you start thinking about that person,

439
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:44,291
your ego gets hit.

440
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:47,375
It is an ego which is hurt,

441
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,291
now you can blow this

442
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,750
balloon by two methods, perhaps you know that,

443
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:01,750
by blowing into it or removing all the air from outside,

444
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:05,291
or even by hitting.

445
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,667
So the hurt ego is where the outside

446
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:15,875
is getting vacated and the balloon is increasing,

447
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:18,875
and the other ego, pumped up ego,

448
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,166
is that when the balloon is filled with that air.

449
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,792
Both things are just the same;

450
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:24,999
I mean the result is the same

451
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,333
whether you do it this way or that way.

452
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,667
So once you understand the physical manifestation of this,

453
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,917
not only that you develop all these diseases but also

454
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,583
develop a thing called lunacy at a very, very young age,

455
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:43,542
because you don’t know how to cope with yourself.

456
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,667
So the best way is to, if you have done something,

457
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,166
forgive yourself at that point,

458
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,250
“I forgive myself at this point, all right.

459
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:54,417
And that this was done because of this - all right,

460
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,208
so I should not have done this.

461
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,792
Never I’m not going to do it again,”

462
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,834
Just say like that, just absolutely neutralize.

463
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,709
Unless and until you neutralize it,

464
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:07,625
you again store it up there, that’s the point is.

465
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:14,959
Secondly I have to tell you that the women in the West

466
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:20,458
have changed their styles, which is very, very dangerous

467
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:23,750
for their society, because they have also taken

468
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,166
to the egoistical ways of men.

469
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:29,625
So if men have gone say ten feet

470
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,709
they have run after them again,

471
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,834
about say eight feet and pulled back men

472
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,875
even to go further than them.

473
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:43,000
Now this is completely crossing your egos,

474
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:49,125
because women do not have such possibility of egos normally.

475
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,041
So competing men in ego what you did

476
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:55,333
you have lost your complete mariadas of a woman,

477
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,542
there’s no mariada of a woman.

478
00:28:57,917 --> 00:28:59,959
Man has a mariada of a man;

479
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:03,750
if a man starts behaving like a woman, he’s not a man.

480
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,792
In the same way, the women, if they start behaving like men,

481
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,875
then they are no more women. They lost their mariadas.

482
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,999
They’re out, so they get possessed.

483
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,000
And that’s why women, when they are egoistical

484
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,250
they become horrid,

485
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,917
their faces become horrid, they look horrid,

486
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,959
their whole behavior is horrid.

487
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,458
They can become dry like bean sticks you see,

488
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,000
and could be so hard as to hit you like an iron rod.

489
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:36,375
They say, “The lady with the iron rod in her hand.”

490
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,000
All this happens because we have a mariada,

491
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,166
we are the style as we are.

492
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,875
If it’s a rose, it’s a rose.

493
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,208
Be happy that you are a flower of rose.

494
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:52,417
Now the rose wants to become the thorn,

495
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,166
so we lose all our mariadas.

496
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:04,375
Today I will be speaking to you before we start this

497
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,875
here when the people are coming before that,

498
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:10,917
to the ladies and tell them what’s gone wrong with them,

499
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:15,041
and that is how you must know that the plight

500
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,625
of the West is not by men, but by women.

501
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:26,125
Women have ruined the society of West, Western society.

502
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,166
Is the Indian women who have kept the society intact.

503
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:35,542
All My really thanks to their solid behavior towards life.

504
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,333
It is the women of this country

505
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:43,417
who have ruined all that was so delicate,

506
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:47,500
emotional, beautiful, love, affection, compassion.

507
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:51,291
Women are there to give joy

508
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:56,041
and happiness and emotional security to the whole society.

509
00:30:56,417 --> 00:31:00,709
While they take over, “Do this, give that, do that.”

510
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:05,000
Even the husbands have become just like servants in the house.

511
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,041
“You haven’t done the cleaning properly,

512
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:10,667
you haven’t cleaned the kitchen properly.”

513
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:14,583
I went to England, I was surprised all kitchen

514
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,834
cleaning and all that is so well done in England,

515
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,333
you see you have everything for cleaning this,

516
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,083
cleaning that. I said, “Why it has happened?”

517
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,083
It’s the men, you see, they had to do it

518
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,166
so they found out all the ways and methods.

519
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,500
Have to be sparkling all right, sparkling you want,

520
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,083
I’ll get you such a thing that

521
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,291
if you put in your hand your hand will burn,

522
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,208
all the acids put everywhere,

523
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:41,750
with a big glove in the hand put it everywhere.

524
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,000
And everything gets all right.

525
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,583
Then the children, you see, suffer,

526
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,417
because that’s the job of a gardener,

527
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:54,291
beautiful things that are born,

528
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:56,250
to be looked after with that kindness.

529
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,917
But you over-indulge into your children in the beginning.

530
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,417
A mother is like a gardener, she has to prune also;

531
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,375
she has to cut also,

532
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,041
so the growth is all right.

533
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,333
If you child is spoilt

534
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:15,917
you’re no good a mother, useless you are.

535
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,959
But you groom your husband not your children,

536
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,375
just the other way round,

537
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,625
because ego is towards your husband all the time grooming.

538
00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:28,959
“Sit here, go there, what’s this?”

539
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,000
Money business, “Give me all the money,

540
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,333
I keep all the money,” everything.

541
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,583
Now one may say that the law is such.

542
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,500
If the law is stupid, the Sahaja Yoginis

543
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,625
should not take to such a law.

544
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,166
That law has ruined you all, I tell you.

545
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,166
Because this is such an important part of life,

546
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:51,999
it is such an important area of life

547
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:57,333
that it should not have suffered.

548
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,500
Where affection, love, kindness,

549
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,333
all that is required is missing,

550
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,000
then you become people without any meaning.

551
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,500
Life is aimless. You don’t know what to do,

552
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,583
that’s why the children commit suicide.

553
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,875
And then the love should be such that they should be pruned,

554
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,500
for that you must have wisdom,

555
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,166
which also one does not develop,

556
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,041
because if you run after your Mooladhara Chakra

557
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,500
how can you have wisdom?

558
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,333
Here men have befooled you completely.

559
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,999
Completely they have befooled you, take it from Me.

560
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,792
You must keep your wisdom intact.

561
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,667
And not only that they have befooled you,

562
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:48,208
but they themselves have stooped down to befool you.

563
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,458
So they have their devious methods,

564
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,999
they are not straightforward.

565
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,000
So, as Sahaja Yogis we are above all these things,

566
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,917
we have reached the state where we are above.

567
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,875
We are here for correcting

568
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,667
all those things that have gone wrong in the society,

569
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,999
because Sahaja Yoga faces towards the society,

570
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,166
not towards yourself only.

571
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,041
So at this stage we have to understand

572
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,375
what we have to do is:

573
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,999
first of all our own understanding should be such.

574
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:21,709
Even now with all this movement of Sahaja Yoga understanding,

575
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,999
women don’t realize that they have to be like women.

576
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:30,000
I have seen them, they still, “What’s wrong?” Still go on,

577
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:35,917
and men don’t understand that they have to be like men,

578
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,583
even after so many (things/years?).

579
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,458
And if they they become really like men,

580
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,792
women will appreciate them.

581
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,792
And if you become really like women,

582
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,625
men will appreciate you.

583
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,083
You see, it’s the opposites that attract each other,

584
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:01,250
that should be normal.

585
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,375
But we live in abnormal way

586
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:07,083
that the men are women and the women are men.

587
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,959
What do you do now?

588
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,709
So it is very important

589
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,834
for men to understand now

590
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,250
- because I am going to talk to women later on

591
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:21,250
- that they should become like men.

592
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,792
They must fix up things, they must take decisions,

593
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,291
they must be the one who must rule.

594
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,583
But that’s outward, actually it’s the source is the woman,

595
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,625
the woman is the potential and man is the kinetic.

596
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:38,542
For example, there’s a fan moving.

597
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:43,000
Movement of the fan is the kinetic force you can say,

598
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,999
but the potential force that is within us

599
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:49,333
is the one which is the electricity,

600
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,750
which is coming from the source.

601
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:55,583
Which is higher, the fan that moves or the source?

602
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,875
Let the women decide and men understand.

603
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,250
But if that source dries out and wants to become the fan,

604
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,291
no fan will work.

605
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,542
Upside down situation.

606
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,875
If you realize you are the source,

607
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,625
you are the one who is going to give all the shakti to men,

608
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:17,792
you will stop behaving like men.

609
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,709
It doesn’t mean that you cannot go to work, you cannot do;

610
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:24,250
but take to work which is more suitable to women.

611
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:28,041
Like I would not like a woman to have a bus driver’s job

612
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:32,375
or a truck driver, or wrestler.

613
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:42,834
No. I’m not telling you; I’m telling from experience.

614
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,417
Once I was traveling,

615
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:49,458
I was a student at that time, in Lahore, you see,

616
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,000
and I was traveling by train and at some station,

617
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,125
you see, the train stopped in the night

618
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:00,917
and a lady came and she said, “Open the door for me.”

619
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,333
So I said, “But it’s so crowded, all right I’ll try, I’ll try.”

620
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,583
And she said. “If You don’t open I can break it.”

621
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,667
I said, “How can you?”

622
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,375
She said, “You don’t know who I am?” I said, “Who?”

623
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:11,125
She said, “I am Ahmida Bhanu.”

624
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,792
I said, ‘Who’s Ahmida Bhanu?” “The wrestler lady.”

625
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,667
“Oh, baba,” I said, “Thank God.”

626
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,250
I said, “If you’re a wrestler lady

627
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:20,291
why are you coming in the ladies department,

628
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,875
why don’t you go to the men’s?”

629
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,750
And she pushed the door so violently,

630
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,250
she came up and I looked at her, you know I said,

631
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,750
“Wow, what a person!”

632
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:42,000
And she sat down, you see, with her whole countenance

633
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,834
and everything, her gait and state of sitting,

634
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,166
everything was so manly.

635
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,417
Like that she sat down and said,

636
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,375
“Come along now those who want to say I should not sit here.”

637
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:54,458
I said, “Nobody wants that now, Madam, you sit comfortably.

638
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,333
But we’ll have to get somebody

639
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,458
from the other compartment to have wrestling.”

640
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:03,834
And then she was quiet, and she was really,

641
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:07,333
I saw her all her muscles so overdeveloped

642
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:10,083
and she was really looking like

643
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:15,166
I would say a Western cow, we can say.

644
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:25,333
Like the cows here look like buffalos, not like cows.

645
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,333
Something very funny I cannot forget that,

646
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,333
you see that experience, I was very young and I was really,

647
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:35,125
I didn’t know, and I felt like laughing but I couldn’t even

648
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,542
laugh at her, she’ll box my (face?).

649
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:44,542
So this is what it is, that we are ending up there,

650
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,875
must know that, how far are we going.

651
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,667
Are we going to become wrestlers?

652
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,750
So this is what it is,

653
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,375
one has to learn that it has been there for ages,

654
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,041
ages it has been there.

655
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:05,000
I have seen, I’ve read books, some books, old books;

656
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,542
I’ve seen some films also,

657
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:09,041
where they’ve shown even in olden times,

658
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:11,000
the women used to have broom in their hands

659
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,792
hitting their husband sort of thing.

660
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,458
We, too, have some of them blessed in India

661
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:19,625
but they’re very, very few, very few women like that.

662
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:24,375
Not a big number but it may increase, God knows, you see,

663
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,083
so keep your fingers crossed,

664
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:29,542
but I would say that this is what is happening.

665
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:33,125
So with too much ego of men which goes into Left Vishuddhi

666
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,458
they say, “No, let the women take over, it’s all right,

667
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,792
let them be satisfied. No more of their aggression,

668
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,500
let them have their own.”

669
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,250
So they do what they like,

670
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:46,500
men are not bothered and they go into their left this thing,

671
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,291
and there’s no enjoyment of marriage or love.

672
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,750
So now we had yesterday the other marriage

673
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:56,625
for the benefit of your children, for the goodness of them,

674
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,375
all that, take your roles as women and men.

675
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:02,834
Your roles are as women and men

676
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,125
and you’ll see you’ll enjoy it.

677
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:08,208
The quarrel should be on that role.

678
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,625
The man wants to do something for you, you should say,

679
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,250
“No, no, no how can you do? That’s too much for me.

680
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:14,917
Let me do this work.”

681
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,875
As I’ve told you many a times

682
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:18,917
how My husband when he gets angry

683
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:22,458
he wants to wash his undershirt, you see to show he’s angry.

684
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:27,750
Or when he’s very angry, then he will clean the bathroom.

685
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,542
But he does it so badly

686
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,999
that I know that it is he has done.

687
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,792
I feel like laughing but I dare not

688
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:45,041
because I must keep his spirit on.

689
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:49,542
And then he starts talking in a very you see,

690
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,333
respectable way to everyone.

691
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,083
“Thou,” he calls everyone ‘thou,’ you see.

692
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,792
“Thou,” he says, “Thou are like that, thou are like that,”

693
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,999
so I know now he is really angry for something.

694
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,458
But he won’t say what he is angry with, you see.

695
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:06,333
Then we have to find out what is he angry with,

696
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,625
and if so, don’t feel guilty, correct it.

697
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,291
And then he finds - you see there are so many ways

698
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,917
of neutralizing the anger.

699
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:21,125
The first thing that happens with ego is the anger.

700
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,333
As yesterday you got married,

701
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,875
you must know how to neutralize this

702
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,083
because still ego is there.

703
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,750
Now to find out how to neutralize

704
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,709
the anger of another person is a very beautiful thing

705
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,083
which I’ve never seen your writers handling,

706
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:38,250
but in India we have many writers

707
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,583
who have handled the situation.

708
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,542
Now you must find out

709
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,375
what are the weak points of your husband, first of all,

710
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,999
and of your wife.

711
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,083
On what point she get upset.

712
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,500
Now the attitude should be we should not upset her,

713
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,959
we should not make her angry,

714
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,583
and another attitude of the wife the same way,

715
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,583
much more for the husband.

716
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:01,083
So now, what are the soft points

717
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:05,542
on which he really gets upset? Just study, it’s very simple,

718
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,834
laugh at it, don’t take it seriously

719
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,667
but be careful to avoid that.

720
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,291
Now also find out what makes him happy.

721
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:16,375
Like if I’m really sometimes - I never get angry,

722
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,458
as you know that, I never get angry,

723
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,375
but if I am showing off My anger just …

724
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:35,083
So, now how to show that,

725
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:38,750
how to neutralize an anger of a person?

726
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,166
Say now, supposing I am trying to show,

727
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,291
if you put a child in My lap - finished, anger is gone.

728
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,999
I cannot show anger with a child on My lap, is simple.

729
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,625
So you must find out.

730
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,625
Like My husband, you see, if he’s angry supposing,

731
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:56,500
I know him then if I tell him that

732
00:42:56,834 --> 00:43:00,208
“What about getting Me a nice sari.”

733
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:03,583
Ah, finished, then he’s very happy.

734
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,250
Ah, I’ve done him the greatest favor, you see.

735
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,709
Like that, you see, you must find out

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,792
what thing pleases your husband,

737
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,458
what thing pleases your wife, and neutralize it.

738
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,041
And, you see, little things like that you must learn.

739
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,750
This is the art of living,

740
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,583
this is the art of living a Sahaja Yogi life.

741
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,166
Is the art of living it,

742
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,959
how with little few things you see how I manage.

743
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,333
Now you must have seen how in My lecture

744
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:32,500
I say quite serious things, but in your bubbles of laughter

745
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,792
it just settles down in your mind,

746
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,333
that’s how you should do it.

747
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,625
Because humor is one of the greatest things

748
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,625
that puts the thing through, makes the person understand,

749
00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:46,083
and it doesn’t harm anyone.

750
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:47,999
That’s how things improve,

751
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,834
and when you see that you are settled down in peace,

752
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,166
that’s the first thing a husband and wife must do

753
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,500
is to settle down in peace.

754
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:58,583
Children feel all right, everyone feels all right

755
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,166
and then gradually let it correct.

756
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:05,250
You have no responsibility of correcting each other;

757
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,834
but if you have married somebody who is not a Sahaja Yogini,

758
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,166
who is horrid and all that,

759
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,583
then the question is very different.

760
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,000
But both are Sahaja Yogis married before Me,

761
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:15,250
should be the easiest thing to do.

762
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:18,291
And protect each other; look after each other.

763
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:20,667
There should be complete confidence.

764
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:26,458
And this is - we have in our country, really I must say

765
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,417
our marriage system has something special about it.

766
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,125
What happened, once I went to Singapore you’ll be surprised,

767
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,750
the early times, I was going to America,

768
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,125
and there was one horrible diplomat’s wife,

769
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,458
she came drunk to the program

770
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:42,250
and she was asked to get out because she was drunk.

771
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:44,834
So she informed our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

772
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,667
that “This lady is doing this kind of work

773
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:48,750
and She should not do this, She’s a diplomat’s wife

774
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,625
and She’s so highly placed” and this and that.”

775
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,125
So Indira Gandhi without understanding anything

776
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,542
told one fellow who was Haksar,

777
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,375
who was her main person that

778
00:44:57,709 --> 00:44:58,999
“You go and tell Mr. Srivastava

779
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,333
that this should not be done and She should be brought back.”

780
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,083
So the minister, you see,

781
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,000
getting a message for Indira Gandhi

782
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,000
means the deathblow has come to the minister that time.

783
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,000
So he sent for My husband.

784
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,125
And he called him and he said that

785
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:15,834
“We think you wife should be called back

786
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,125
and this is what has happened.”

787
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,375
And he said, “Why? Why do you want to call Her?

788
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,125
She doesn’t drink, She doesn’t smoke,

789
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,583
She doesn’t do anything wrong. She’s the most decent woman,

790
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:28,083
She’s very dignified and She knows what She’s doing.

791
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,917
She’s doing good work for no money at all.

792
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:33,208
She’s doing nothing wrong and if you want I’ll resign

793
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:34,750
but I’ll not call Her.”

794
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,875
And he got a fright of his life,

795
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,667
because if he resigns who’s going to do the job?

796
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,875
So capable. Just said, “I’ll resign.”

797
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,709
And they were all shocked at it you see,

798
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:50,000
the way he was confident.

799
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,583
And this I came to know through somebody else,

800
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,709
though he himself the minister who was dead,

801
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,834
half dead with the message from the Prime Minister, you see.

802
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,000
And he then sent back, he also got to see within himself,

803
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,000
he said, “I know the lady very well, She’s very dignified,

804
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,583
She’s a very decent lady, She’s very dharmic

805
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,834
we shouldn’t disturb Her.”

806
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,542
While the fellow Haksar who had sent the message

807
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:14,959
also got a shock, you see,

808
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,250
and pushed back the shock to Indira Gandhi.

809
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,709
Since that she has never,

810
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,125
never tried to interfere with My work.

811
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,375
You’ll be surprised, she’s never tried to interfere.

812
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,041
This is my husband’s confidence in My work and understanding.

813
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,375
That you should have.

814
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,583
You must know your wife and know your husband,

815
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,999
they cannot do such and such thing.

816
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,959
About, same about your children.

817
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,917
You must have full confidence in them.

818
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:40,667
You must know what they are, what they are up to,

819
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:42,458
how far they can go.

820
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:45,834
And then this confidence, an inner understanding

821
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,792
is the one road to peace, love and affection.

822
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,875
Complete confidence into each other,

823
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:53,125
wherever they may be.

824
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,667
I can say with confidence you send my daughters anywhere

825
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,208
they will never take to adharmic life,

826
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,250
nor my son-in-laws, but my own daughters I can tell you.

827
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:04,667
They can never think of adharmic life,

828
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,959
whatever you may try.

829
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,417
It should be that confidence within you

830
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:12,750
about your own children.

831
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,792
Like they were small, very small and the neighbors came

832
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,250
and said that “Your daughters came and were using this,

833
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,667
our garden, for morning ablution.”

834
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,709
I said. “What?” Said, “My children,

835
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:31,041
even if they can go into your bathroom, you take them.

836
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,333
I give you two thousand rupees just now, right now.

837
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:37,333
You just ask them to go to your bathroom,

838
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:39,333
that’s all.”

839
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:42,333
I know them too well.

840
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,041
If somebody will say, “Your daughter has taken something,”

841
00:47:46,417 --> 00:47:49,625
I know them too well, they can never touch anybody’s things,

842
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:50,999
I know them too well.

843
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,792
They’ll never take any obligation from anyone like that,

844
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,959
I know them too well.

845
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,417
So that’s what you should know your children too well.

846
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,917
Don’t insult them in the presence of others.

847
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,999
Build up their character and majesty by saying,

848
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,250
“Come along, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

849
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,458
you are great, you’ll be this, that,”

850
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:13,250
and put them on that path,

851
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,542
keep them there, respect them.

852
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:19,417
But don’t spoil them. Don’t spoil them.

853
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,041
We normally spoil.

854
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:24,583
Either we’re over-indulgent or you make them over-indulgent,

855
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:28,291
both things are wrong, is again ego.

856
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,417
Tell them how to share things, tell them how to share.

857
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,667
And like if they share,

858
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:37,667
they give it to somebody else you should be happy,

859
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,875
it’s given to others. “Give this to others,

860
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:41,500
let the others play.”

861
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,333
You see, you show your happiness on that,

862
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:44,792
you yourself give to others,

863
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:46,625
then the children learn all these things.

864
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:50,500
So marriage is a very big bondage for Sahaja Yoga.

865
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:53,959
Through marriages we are all bound together.

866
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,208
It’s all a society of very happily married people.

867
00:48:57,417 --> 00:49:01,959
Now if somebody is not capable of having a good marriage,

868
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,208
better forget about it, forget it.

869
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:07,417
See, after all I have seen women of sixty, of My age,

870
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:09,083
asking for a marriage.

871
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:12,166
Yes, there are women and men and they’re sixty years,

872
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,083
“Mother, I’m only sixty and I would like to get married.”

873
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:18,250
I said, “ What?” At sixty I have thousands of children,

874
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,291
how can you say of such a thing?

875
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,875
I mean, you should not be a bride all your life.

876
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,458
You should be a mother and a grandmother.

877
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,458
I think after forty-five

878
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:31,583
nobody should think of marriage, is nonsense.

879
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,333
It’s nonsense after forty-five, all the,

880
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,000
even the married women should know they are mothers

881
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,709
and they are going to be grandmothers,

882
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,375
they’re all the time brides.

883
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,458
You see that’s why, that’s one of the reasons

884
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,250
why marriages fail.

885
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,375
Because you are not a bride after say,

886
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:51,291
thirty years of age or thirty-five years of age,

887
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,667
you are a mother, absolute mother you are.

888
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,875
And you are a father, and that’s how you live as father

889
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:56,959
and mother of the children.

890
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:58,999
We are called like that in our country.

891
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,750
Till the age of thirty, thirty years,

892
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,959
we are called as the brides like doolai

893
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,250
but once you are grown up

894
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,750
- I’m never called as My name by anyone.

895
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,667
They say “Kalpana’s Mother” or “Sadhana’s Mother.”

896
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,875
Or even My husband is called as Kalpana’s father,

897
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,291
is never called by his name,

898
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,250
because you become a father and a mother,

899
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:18,542
accept that position.

900
00:50:18,917 --> 00:50:20,625
But no, you want to be brides at that age,

901
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:25,125
so you want to have all the bed like a bride has,

902
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:28,041
all the bedroom thing like a bride has,

903
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,959
and the bedroom thing and it doesn’t work out.

904
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,792
Because you are no more a bride,

905
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:36,542
and then you think, “Oh, this man has become insipid,”

906
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:37,959
“This woman has become insipid,”

907
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:40,709
then you go to another woman, another man, goes on.

908
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,458
Then you go to children

909
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,750
and spoil the innocence of the people.

910
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,917
But if you accept, grow properly, mature like Sahaja Yogis,

911
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,166
as father and mother, as dignified people.

912
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:58,250
It’s not the source of love only as husbands’

913
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,041
or wives’ relationship,

914
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:03,083
there are so many relationships, which are a greater source,

915
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:06,083
but depends on at what point you are.

916
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:09,375
When you are a small little river, all right;

917
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:13,542
but now you have become the ocean, so become the ocean.

918
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:15,500
When you become the sea, become the sea.

919
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,000
When you become the ocean, you become the ocean.

920
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,166
A sea cannot remain like a little,

921
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:23,999
little small little beginning, can it?

922
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,792
In the same way everyone must know that

923
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:30,125
they must grow out from this relationship

924
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,750
and should not go on hankering all the time

925
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:34,583
that husband and wife.

926
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,458
Like forty-five years of age

927
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:40,333
they are still finding out their husbands, are they mad?

928
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:45,083
This should stop in our Sahaja Yoga now,

929
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:48,333
all those who have gone beyond a certain age

930
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,999
should stop bothering Me about marriages,

931
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,250
should become mothers,

932
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:53,834
there are so many children to be looked after,

933
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,000
we are going to have nurseries, better be there.

934
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,000
What is it, what is the companionship?

935
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:01,125
The companionship is with children, with the grandchildren,

936
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:04,083
with great-grandchildren.

937
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,917
This is what one has to understand, men and women both.

938
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,291
Men are just the same.

939
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:15,250
Men also try never become fathers.

940
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,875
If you are full-fledged fathers,

941
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:19,875
you don’t have these ideas of marriage, forget it.

942
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:23,709
If it doesn’t work out with one woman, forget it.

943
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:28,750
Then forget it. No need, you’ve had enough of it.

944
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:35,083
So this kind of thing is not necessary at all,

945
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,875
and it has worked in a society

946
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,583
which is not a Sahaja Yogi society,

947
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,458
so it should work in you.

948
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,792
So social ways Indians are quite good,

949
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,333
but they’re bad in economics and politics.

950
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,583
Never follow their politics, horrid.

951
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,458
Horrid.

952
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:54,542
I mean, I can’t think of a worse politics

953
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:57,333
that Indian politics, is the worst of all.

954
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,417
If you listen to that,

955
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,208
you will not know whether to cry or laugh,

956
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:04,917
is such idiots you know, all donkeys have gone into politics,

957
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:07,417
absolutely donkeys. Worse than that.

958
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:09,875
They bray like donkeys, they behave like donkeys,

959
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,208
they kick each other,

960
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,917
they do all kind of things can you imagine,

961
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,250
it’s so horrifying.

962
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:17,959
I mean if you want to have a joke

963
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,291
then you can look at it from a joke point of view,

964
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:24,375
of the donkeys, you see, behaving like,

965
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:28,750
absolutely as if they are in charge of our great country.

966
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,792
So most of them are donkeys,

967
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,999
I’ve not come across many who are sensible.

968
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:36,875
And those who are sensible also want to become donkeys.

969
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:40,959
What to do? That is their greatest desire is to

970
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:45,333
- imagine a saint wants to become a donkey!

971
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,250
So let us know that whatever are our good points

972
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:51,250
are our good points that we should not lose.

973
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,834
Whatever are our bad points we should correct them.

974
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:57,709
This is a very balanced view towards oneself.

975
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,250
Because we are the gain,

976
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:02,000
nobody else is going to gain and Sahaja Yogis

977
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,709
have to be selfish about it. We are the gainers;

978
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,500
if we gain, the whole body gains,

979
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,208
whole of Sahaja Yoga gains.

980
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:12,375
So this is what I am telling you about your social life

981
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:15,333
which is very important, and about your ego.

982
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:17,667
But the most important thing is that

983
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:23,166
once you are in the Sahasara you become My brain,

984
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,333
you become really My brain.

985
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,750
And so you have to be very careful

986
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:33,667
because you’re not thinking about your family,

987
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,083
your children, your household.

988
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:38,792
Not thinking about Melbourne ashram

989
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,458
or Sydney ashram or Australia,

990
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:44,417
but you’re thinking about the whole world

991
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:48,542
and the whole Universe, and the betterment of it.

992
00:54:48,959 --> 00:54:50,291
When you grow to that state

993
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,208
you become really part and parcel of My brain,

994
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:58,709
which is concerned with very bigger visions, higher things.

995
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:01,166
It works on lower levels also,

996
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:02,875
that’s something good about it,

997
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,875
but it can work on your individual levels.

998
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,917
I pay attention to your individual problems,

999
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:11,250
to your individual suggestions, to anything that you say,

1000
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,208
but the light is for the whole Universe.

1001
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:20,583
So we enter into the realm of universal religion,

1002
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:23,333
which we have to awaken, which we have to work out.

1003
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:25,750
Unless and until you achieve that state,

1004
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,834
you will not be called full-fledged Sahaja Yogis.

1005
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,500
So, to achieve that you must work hard,

1006
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:33,792
or we can call now you are Sahaja Yogis,

1007
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:35,834
you’ll become maha yogis.

1008
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,500
So, we have to achieve that state of maha yoga.

1009
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:42,917
From this to that is very simple, (it) works out.

1010
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:47,083
Imagine four years back I never thought

1011
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:50,917
that I will be able to establish so many of you

1012
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:53,999
here as My children, and it has happened today.

1013
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,375
It’s such a great thing that in four years

1014
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,458
we have been able to achieve such beautiful results

1015
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:03,250
and next year will be greater still,

1016
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,625
I can see from the way people were there.

1017
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,999
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga obedience

1018
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,917
to what Mother says is all right.

1019
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,875
But some people have a bad habit of taking up over,

1020
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,792
“for Mother’s sake do it, for Mother.” Who is the person?

1021
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,583
Why should anybody say that do it for Mothers sake?

1022
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:23,625
Or Mother says so.

1023
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:27,333
No, when you are the Spirit you understand what Mother says,

1024
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,417
so try to understand your Spirit.

1025
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:31,542
That’s the best way you can work it out

1026
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:32,959
and you can be nice.

1027
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,500
I want all our children to grow from that height,

1028
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:39,583
let them start with a better standards,

1029
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:43,417
from a better levels, because we started from a lower levels,

1030
00:56:43,709 --> 00:56:45,875
we had problems, but let our children start

1031
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:48,792
from a higher level and Melbourne is the place I’ve chosen

1032
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,375
for our children to grow.

1033
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,875
So I hope women will take their roles,

1034
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:54,333
men will take their roles

1035
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:57,375
and it will be a nice family system built here,

1036
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:02,667
a nice society and this nice society.

1037
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,125
What’s it? Put if off.

1038
00:57:10,917 --> 00:57:14,125
I know.

1039
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:24,792
I know the lights very well.

1040
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,959
I know how they act.

1041
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,667
Vishnumaya, that’s Vishnumaya,

1042
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:33,083
we have harnessed the Vishnumaya.

1043
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:37,792
From where did we get light, Vishnumaya, hidden where?

1044
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:41,166
The Vishnumaya, you see, is the One what we need today,

1045
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,625
and to understand it in a subtle way

1046
00:57:43,999 --> 00:57:45,625
how the Vishnumaya comes.

1047
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,500
See now how sahaj, this thing came there

1048
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:49,834
I could speak on Vishnumaya,

1049
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:54,667
because to shift the subject on Vishnumaya is not easy.

1050
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:59,625
See, you must see the play, you must see the play.

1051
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,375
Now this Vishmumaya, how does it come?

1052
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,291
How it acts through Me so well?

1053
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,500
How, what happens, from where does it come?

1054
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:11,625
Hydroelectric, how hydroelectric was, in water,

1055
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:13,291
it is in water in the Guru Tattwa,

1056
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:16,999
but when, when it comes down,

1057
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,583
when the Guru Tattwa has come down to you.

1058
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:26,083
On that level the Vishnumaya acts,

1059
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,999
that liberates and acts.

1060
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,667
For what? For enlightening.

1061
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,625
What happens in the gross happens in the subtle.

1062
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:45,291
So One has to take an incarnation,

1063
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,542
so the Guru principle has to take an incarnation

1064
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,542
to come down to this earth.

1065
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:54,041
So Vishnumaya acts and enlightens people

1066
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,834
and this is what it is, and how the whole thing works out.

1067
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,083
Now you have seen how I could change the topic

1068
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:08,041
suddenly to that, and you didn’t feel it.

1069
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:11,709
But I just wanted you to see how Mother changes the topics,

1070
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:15,375
because there are some incidents something happens

1071
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:18,542
somewhere, which I know, and it changes.

1072
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:23,208
And it looks like a smooth one subject going on.

1073
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:27,041
Another thing I have to tell you

1074
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,875
that all of you must know Sahaja Yoga full well.

1075
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,083
Very few people really know about Kundalini,

1076
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:33,750
really know about vibrations.

1077
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,333
They do not know where is the Void.

1078
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,625
There should be a regular class,

1079
00:59:36,999 --> 00:59:38,834
even for grown up Sahaja Yogis.

1080
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,166
Where is the Void on the feet,

1081
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:42,834
where are the chakras on the feet?

1082
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,750
When I tell them to rub My Feet, they don’t know where it is.

1083
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,500
You may be uneducated, doesn’t matter,

1084
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,000
but in Sahaja Yoga you should be educated.

1085
00:59:53,375 --> 00:59:55,208
You should have a full education in Sahaja Yoga.

1086
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,542
You must know where is this disease coming from,

1087
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:04,208
how to cure it. Every one of you should be educated here.

1088
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,291
So when you have your meditation class,

1089
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:10,000
also you must have a class to educate yourself

1090
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,999
about Sahaja Yoga,

1091
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,417
what are the things to be done.

1092
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:16,999
Now there’s a book, of course I saw that’s a good book

1093
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:19,333
they have written about children, but there’s no spontaneity,

1094
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:20,792
so I’ll have to work it out.

1095
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:25,458
But it’s not only the books but My tapes are there.

1096
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,375
When you are listening to My tapes,

1097
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:30,333
note down the points what Mother has said,

1098
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:31,625
and see for yourself.

1099
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:34,417
So the education in Sahaja Yoga is very important,

1100
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,250
otherwise your intelligence will rust out.

1101
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:39,834
You must have full education of Sahaja Yoga,

1102
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,999
only giving Realization is not the work.

1103
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:45,583
You must have, so others must know you are knowledgeable.

1104
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,291
The amount of education you have had nobody had before,

1105
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,458
no saint had it.

1106
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:53,542
So now take full advantage.

1107
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:56,834
Whatever your age may be, education qualification maybe,

1108
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:59,375
what doesn’t matter but you should all know

1109
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:02,083
what is Sahaja Yoga, what it means, how it works out.

1110
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:06,166
Ask questions yourself and find answers.

1111
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,333
You all are still students of Sahaja Yoga - must know that,

1112
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,458
you are still students of Sahaja Yoga and you must master it,

1113
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:15,667
you must know it, every word of it.

1114
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:17,792
Just to enjoy Sahaja Yoga is not the point,

1115
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:19,166
you must also know.

1116
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,709
Like, if you enjoy a cake cooked by somebody,

1117
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,375
you must know how it is cooked,

1118
01:01:24,709 --> 01:01:27,166
because then you can cook for others.

1119
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:29,041
But if you don’t know how to cook

1120
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,999
people are not going to believe. This is what I’ve seen.

1121
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,083
Then I’ve seen some Sahaja Yogis

1122
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:36,250
are all the time doing the work,

1123
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:39,500
they’re active because they’ve been active before,

1124
01:01:39,834 --> 01:01:40,959
but some are lethargic.

1125
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,583
You can see even among two Indian people

1126
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:45,125
you’ll find the same difference,

1127
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:48,542
though they are here or they may be there, it should not be.

1128
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:52,500
Everybody should try to create the same kind

1129
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,792
of an enthusiasm and dynamism, not one person.

1130
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,458
If one person does it, then it’s no use.

1131
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,917
Sometimes such a one person can be very dominating also.

1132
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:04,208
Everybody should work, the whole body has to work,

1133
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:05,667
if we can develop that,

1134
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:11,834
that will help the complete development, upliftment.

1135
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,000
All right?

1136
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:18,875
So today on this day of My Birthday,

1137
01:02:19,625 --> 01:02:21,917
I want to bless you very much,

1138
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:25,458
but every birthday is reducing My age you must know that,

1139
01:02:25,834 --> 01:02:29,500
and so you must grow up now to take over, is important.

1140
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,875
Is very important that you must grow up,

1141
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,375
so-called age of Mine,

1142
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,875
though it doesn’t show but it is decreasing,

1143
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,917
you must know that, and so you have to now

1144
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,208
fasten your movements, get to it, work it out.

1145
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:45,125
When others come, talk to them nicely, give them joy,

1146
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:46,999
don’t give them any - give them joy.

1147
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:48,542
Look after them, be kind to them,

1148
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,291
that is going to be attractive than to,

1149
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:52,709
immediately somebody says, “You are a bhoot you get out.”

1150
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
When they are in Sahaja Yoga, when they are there,

1151
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,208
I will tell them off.

1152
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,709
There are still, I know some of them still here,

1153
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,208
we have to tell them that,

1154
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,166
“You have a problem, you better get out.”

1155
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:04,458
It’s all right, they’ll have to get out of the ashrams

1156
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,417
for a while then come back.

1157
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:09,291
It has to be like that, otherwise they cannot be corrected

1158
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,625
and such people must accept gladly that

1159
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,542
they should be all right, they must change;

1160
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,291
they must be better than to continue

1161
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,875
with whatever they have because of their ego.

1162
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:22,000
So try to co-operate with your self

1163
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,458
because it wants to be better, and better and better.

1164
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,000
So all those people whom I’ll be asking,

1165
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:30,000
I’ll tell Warren, whom those people whom I find

1166
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,041
are not all right should get out of ashram.

1167
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,834
Ashram is not a place where all kinds of people should stay.

1168
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,999
Here only the pure up to a point they should be.

1169
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,458
There should be certain minimum standard they must have.

1170
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:43,542
If they do not have that standard, they get out.

1171
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,000
Even if there’s a woman who is dominating,

1172
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:49,291
or a man who is like a woman, has to get out.

1173
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:50,999
You have to be normal people,

1174
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:53,291
otherwise others who come and they see

1175
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:58,709
one man standing like a chicken cut from here, you see.

1176
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:02,417
They just don’t feel impressed.

1177
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:18,917
I tell you, like a miserable Christ you see as I showed you,

1178
01:04:19,166 --> 01:04:20,542
standing there limply like that.

1179
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:23,709
I don’t know who feels impressed by that.

1180
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:26,625
You must have somebody like you have Christ

1181
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:29,999
in the Sistine Chapel, you see, standing

1182
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:32,625
like a (inaudible) that’s how the men should be,

1183
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:38,000
but dignified, respectable, kindly,

1184
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:42,000
majestic is all right.

1185
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:44,917
And the women should be very sweet and nice.

1186
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:51,250
It pays a very, very long and a great dividend.

1187
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,709
Very, very, long,

1188
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:56,291
you don’t know how much it has paid Me.

1189
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,792
It is coming so handy today to Me.

1190
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:01,709
You see when I was not doing Sahaja Yoga

1191
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,792
by My nature I’ve been kind to people,

1192
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,750
and all that has come.

1193
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,208
One example I’ll give you, in London one fellow came,

1194
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:16,083
his name is …that commissioner’s name is what?

1195
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,999
Commissioner of Pune, he’s now commissioner of Pune,

1196
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,125
all right.

1197
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:25,750
He came to see us, we had a meeting of My husband’s office

1198
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,208
or something. CP said, “I’ll call them for dinner.”

1199
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,250
I said, “All right.” I had cooked the dinner at home;

1200
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,959
there were about twenty-five people who came to dinner.

1201
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,291
They had dinner I must have looked after them,

1202
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:36,834
whatever it is.

1203
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,125
So when I went to Pune, Mehrotra,

1204
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,041
told Me that this Commissioner is very anxious

1205
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,625
that he should come as the President or the Chairman

1206
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:46,709
or the reception committee, must receive Me.

1207
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,125
I said, “I don’t remember who is this gentleman.

1208
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,875
I remember somebody with the same name.”

1209
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:52,875
He said, “No, no, no, no this is another one.”

1210
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:56,208
Now this is one of them who had come

1211
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,917
and he praised Me so much, I was amazed how he saw all that.

1212
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,000
He said, “This lady whose husband is so highly placed

1213
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:07,834
in life, is so humble, She’s so kind, so motherly.”

1214
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,125
And he went home and told his wife,

1215
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:11,750
“That I’ve never seen such a lady before,

1216
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,917
such a perfect Lady.”

1217
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,542
That’s what I did I don’t know.

1218
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:19,250
I must have cooked well, of course that I do,

1219
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:26,667
but I must have looked after him well,

1220
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:29,417
I must have been kind to him, to all of them.

1221
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:33,125
I must have not eaten anything Myself,

1222
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:34,834
looked after, must have done something,

1223
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:35,917
I don’t remember what I did.

1224
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,083
But by My own nature I have to do,

1225
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:40,667
and it is not today but I’ve seen so many of them

1226
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:43,417
come so handy, only because of this nature of Mine,

1227
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,166
only because of this nature of Mine.

1228
01:06:46,542 --> 01:06:51,041
You know our High Commissioner in UK,

1229
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:54,125
both the High Commissioners the first one and the second one,

1230
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,709
B.K.Nehru, and the second one,

1231
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
they had such tremendous respect for Me, regard for Me,

1232
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:02,083
can’t imagine,

1233
01:07:02,792 --> 01:07:06,542
because you have to be kind and considerate and nice.

1234
01:07:06,792 --> 01:07:10,083
As you look after Me here, I looked after them.

1235
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:13,375
And that’s how they have such impressions,

1236
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:15,959
I tell you all my husband’s friends and everybody

1237
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,500
have such regard and respect.

1238
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,125
We went to see somebody who is head of the law,

1239
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,250
is the head of the Intelligence in India;

1240
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,458
he gave us a right royal treatment.

1241
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:30,792
The Collector of Customs was informed that

1242
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:34,291
Mother’s children are coming,

1243
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,999
he himself came to the airport, do you know that?

1244
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,250
He was sitting there I don’t know if he came out

1245
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,709
to see that you were all out.

1246
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,291
It is only My personal life with them

1247
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,458
otherwise who cares for whose wife?

1248
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:49,166
So many came after My husband,

1249
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,333
nobody’s bothered about their wives.

1250
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:54,500
Anywhere, you see I came this time

1251
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:56,625
with My husband to go to China

1252
01:07:56,999 --> 01:08:01,792
and his agents who were in Japan and other places,

1253
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,000
Honolulu, they all came just to meet Me,

1254
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,999
because he comes nobody comes to see him.

1255
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,041
He said, “Now You have come, they’ve come to see.”

1256
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,250
Can you believe it?

1257
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:18,250
It’s nothing but just being a lady to them.

1258
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:19,917
It’s such a powerful thing.

1259
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:23,333
It’s such a powerful thing and women must know how to cook,

1260
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:24,417
that’s important.

1261
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:26,041
If they don’t know how to cook they’re not women,

1262
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,417
I don’t think they’re women.

1263
01:08:27,792 --> 01:08:30,083
They all must know how to cook.

1264
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:33,792
You must learn how to cook and everybody can learn it,

1265
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:35,000
that’s very important.

1266
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,583
Is the hidden power of a woman lies in how she cooks.

1267
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,667
You see our men cannot go anywhere

1268
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:45,417
because we cook so well they have to come back home.

1269
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,667
They remember the food.

1270
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,000
So that is the power you have.

1271
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:55,375
Today we are going to have a very short puja

1272
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:57,291
because today is My Birthday

1273
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:03,417
and so the puja on a birthday should be such that

1274
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:10,291
it should be more deep, more heartfelt, more joyous,

1275
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:15,917
than it should sort of go on a ritual side.

1276
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,583
There’s no need to have much rituals

1277
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:18,999
because we are in a joyous mood

1278
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:20,709
celebrating our Mother’s Birthday.

1279
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:22,208
Already we are there,

1280
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,667
whatever is needed for you to be there

1281
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:27,625
is not needed now because you are in that joyous mood,

1282
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:28,625
all right?

1283
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,166
So only thing a very short puja, I have told him,

1284
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,999
is to be done today is a Birthday.

1285
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,500
There is no need to have a huge big puja,

1286
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:40,500
all that is needed to bring out all the deities,

1287
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,083
they’re already there, up there,

1288
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,750
just see the vibrations they are emitting!

1289
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:49,834
They’re so very happy that you are celebrating My Birthday.

1290
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:53,417
So in every puja what we have to do is to awaken them,

1291
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:56,333
ask them to be kind to you, this, that.

1292
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,792
Though they are awakened in Me you want them to be.

1293
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:00,625
But now they’re all awakened in you

1294
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:02,709
we don’t have to have big puja at all,

1295
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,291
there’s no need at all.

1296
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:07,500
And this is what I’ve told Modi that you have a very,

1297
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:11,166
very short puja and a very short puja should be all right.

1298
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,750
So today’s talk was just like a puja.

1299
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,834
Remember that this is meant for you

1300
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,375
when you were not Sahaja Yogis.

1301
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:23,333
Today it is not meant for you. So you won’t feel guilty.

1302
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,291
First remember you are Sahaja Yogis,

1303
01:10:27,542 --> 01:10:29,667
you are My children and I love you very much,

1304
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:31,125
very, very much.

1305
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,250
So please have confidence in yourself,

1306
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,917
complete confidence in yourself, all right?

1307
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,208
That’s the greatest thing you can give Me today

1308
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:41,999
as a present. May God bless you!

1309
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:46,500
Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.

1310
01:10:56,959 --> 01:11:00,709
So for this you have to have washing of My Feet

1311
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,542
for ten - five minutes

1312
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:06,208
and washing of My Hands for about ten minutes,

1313
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:07,917
that’s all, as simple as that.

1314
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:09,959
Now we don’t need many people for that,

1315
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,583
just put that thing here.
