00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,829
[Applause]

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,810
my idea of coming to conduct me for

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,380
Shibuya

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:35,820
was this that Shiva represents the

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:39,350
spirit and the spirit is residing in all

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,350
of you in your hearts

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:55,470
the seat of Sadashiva is on top of your

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:55,470
head but is reflected in your heart

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,700
now your brain is the bitter

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:16,720
so to bring spirit to your brain means

12
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:16,720
enlightenment of your brain

13
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:28,439
enlightenment of your brain means the

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:38,700
limited capacity of your brain has to

15
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:40,950
become unlimited in its capacity to

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,880
realize God we I will not use the word

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:51,740
understand to realize God how powerful

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,740
is how miraculous is how greatly

19
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:06,520
the another is that the brain of man can

20
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,520
create of course out of the dead

21
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:14,950
but when T Spirit comes into brain

22
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:26,860
then you create living things living

23
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,860
work of Kundalini

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:39,180
even the dead start behaving like living

25
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:42,180
because you touch the spirit in the dead

26
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,180
like

27
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:56,370
the nucleus inside every atom or a

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:02,400
molecule has the spirit of that molecule

29
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:06,739
and if you become useful we can say the

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,739
brain of

31
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,250
a molecule or an atom is like the

32
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,410
nucleus body of the nucleus but the one

33
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:22,250
that controls a nucleus is the spirit

34
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:27,550
that resides within the nucleus so now

35
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,550
you have got the attention of the body

36
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:37,190
the whole body of the atom then the

37
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,640
nucleus and inside the nucleus is the

38
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:43,480
spirit in the same way we have this body

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:56,860
the attention of the body

40
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:56,860
and then we have the we have

41
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,960
the nucleus

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,110
is the brain

43
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:20,690
and the Spirit is in the heart so the

44
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,690
brain is controlled through the spirit

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:33,710
how that around the heart there are

46
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,710
seven auras

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:49,520
which can be multiplied into any number

48
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:52,520
seven raised to power 1600 which are

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
once

50
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,610
which

51
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,610
much

52
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,759
the seven chakras needs to power 16 and

53
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,759
eight

54
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,430
16000 sorry

55
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:18,820
now this

56
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,820
spirit is watching through this aura

57
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:30,550
watching I'm again Singh watching

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,550
through this aura this aura is watching

59
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:40,580
the behavior of your seven centers in

60
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:44,330
your brain is also watching all the

61
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:49,070
nerves that are working into being

62
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:51,700
watching again but when you bring the

63
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,700
spirit

64
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:04,520
into your brain then you go to step side

65
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,110
because when you have CUDA linearizes

66
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:22,800
she catches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva

67
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:27,570
informs the spirit informs the self

68
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:34,490
reflects in the spirit so that's the

69
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,490
first state where the watching or us

70
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:49,640
start communicating through your

71
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:54,900
different chakras in the brain and

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,550
integrating it but when you bring your

73
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,820
spirit to your brain this is the second

74
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,820
state

75
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:12,220
then you really become self-realized in

76
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:18,340
the food in the food because then your

77
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:24,940
scent that is the spirit becomes your

78
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:29,440
brain action is very dynamic

79
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:36,400
it opens then the fifth dimension in the

80
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:39,009
human being first when you become

81
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,639
realized collectively conscious and

82
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:47,530
start raising the Kundalini you are in

83
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:53,259
you cross the fourth dimension when your

84
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:56,229
spirit comes into your brain then you

85
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,919
become the fifth dimension means you

86
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,919
become the doer

87
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,730
our brain now for example says alright

88
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,210
lift this thing up when you touch it

89
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:16,650
with your hands you lift it you have the

90
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:22,740
door but when the brain becomes the

91
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:32,420
spirit the Spirit is the world and when

92
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:32,420
spirit is the doer then you become

93
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,180
a complete Shiva self-realized

94
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:50,380
in that state if you get angry you are

95
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,380
not attached

96
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,889
you are not an attached person to

97
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,930
anything what sir if you possess

98
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:03,910
anything you are not attached

99
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:11,870
you cannot attach because Felicity - not

100
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:15,230
completely you don't bother about any

101
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,889
attachments whatsoever even for a second

102
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,889
you are not attached

103
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,220
now I would say to understand the

104
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,710
detachment of spirit we should study

105
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:40,890
ourselves very well clearly how are we

106
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:46,020
attached we are attached firstly by our

107
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:48,650
brain mostly by our brain because all

108
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:54,800
our conditionings are in the our brain

109
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,800
and all over ego is also in our place

110
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:07,470
so all emotional attachments are through

111
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:11,240
our brain and all our egoistical

112
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,240
attachments also are through our brain

113
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,210
that's why it is said that after

114
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:23,150
realization one must try to practice the

115
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,710
Shiva tattva by practicing detachment

116
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:30,600
now you just watch your attention where

117
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:33,630
is it one watches as soon as you start

118
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,400
watching yourself your attention you

119
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,530
will become more identified with your

120
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,000
spirit because if you have to watch your

121
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,110
attention you have to be your strength

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,110
otherwise how will you watch it

123
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:52,130
the detachment is to be watched and seen

124
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,130
through your own attachments

125
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,649
now because you are realized Souls not

126
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,689
yet the spirit has not come into your

127
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,509
brain of course but still you're

128
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:09,709
realized Souls so what you have you can

129
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:15,049
do is at least to watch your attention

130
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:22,549
you can do that you can watch your

131
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:25,839
attention very clearly by seeing where

132
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,839
your attention is way

133
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:35,480
and then controlling your attention also

134
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,480
isn't very simple

135
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:45,929
to control your attention you have to

136
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:52,559
just remove your attention from this to

137
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:57,239
that try to change your priorities all

138
00:11:52,559 --> 00:12:04,279
this has to be done now so the spirit is

139
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:04,279
like the ocean which has the light in it

140
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:14,789
and when this ocean pours into the

141
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:18,269
little cup of your brain the cup loses

142
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:22,619
its identity and everything becomes

143
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:25,679
virtually everything so it's the ocean

144
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:32,129
that is the spirit well your brain is

145
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:36,449
limited so the detachment from your

146
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:39,209
limited brain has to be brought in all

147
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:42,989
limitations of brain should be broken so

148
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:47,119
that when this ocean fills that brain

149
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:47,119
will break that

150
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:56,800
little captain and every bit of that Cup

151
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:00,699
she'll become colorful the whole

152
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,240
atmosphere everything whatever relocate

153
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:06,999
should be colorful color of the spirit

154
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,300
with her life to the spirit and this

155
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:13,499
light of the Spirit acts works thinks

156
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,579
coordinates does everything

157
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:20,170
this is the reason today

158
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:22,379
I decided to bring Shiva tattva to the

159
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,379
blade

160
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,070
the first procedure is to take your

161
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,770
brain towards the shooter by telling it

162
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:35,090
see where are you going mr. brain

163
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,090
putting attention to this reporting

164
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:41,120
attention to that getting involved on

165
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:46,520
detach become the brain yourself only

166
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:49,310
the brain detach and then take this

167
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,730
detached brain completely filled with

168
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,870
the color of the spirit it will

169
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,420
automatically happen so today I hope we

170
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:06,860
all pray that O Lord give us strength

171
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:09,080
and that source of attraction by which

172
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,990
we give up all the refractions of all

173
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,150
the pleasures of joy of ego of

174
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,270
everything that we think of but we

175
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:23,570
should fall into the pure joy form of

176
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:26,680
the sheer thought oh absolutely

177
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,680
you got richer

178
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,940
