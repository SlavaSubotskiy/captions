1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,550
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,470
We have to understand

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,630
that God has created us as human beings with a purpose.

4
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,830
But in those modern times,

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,150
when we don’t even believe in God,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,070
or on a, in a Creator, or any such energy that exists,

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,430
it’s very hard to talk of God

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,630
and to introduce

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,390
Him to be the One who has made us human beings.

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,070
But even Darwin

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,630
said that if man has come so far

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,230
he will have to go a little further to understand himself.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,910
I would suggest that

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,230
one has to only understand one point,

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,310
that whatever we have so far known

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,390
has been the knowledge of the tree.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,830
But we have to have the knowledge of the roots.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,550
To get the knowledge of the roots,

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,390
we have to become subtler than what we are.

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,550
This awareness, this human awareness, cannot take us that side.

21
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:27,230
For example, you are all listening to Me very intensely,

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,710
but if I say “Please take your attention inside”,

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,910
you’ll say “How? Mother it’s impossible."

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,910
'How do we take our attention inside?”

25
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,630
It’s only possible when something happens within you

26
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,830
that your attention is drawn inside,

27
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,230
then only you will come to know

28
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,910
that you are a beautiful instrument made through ages.

29
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,990
All these centres that are shown here represent

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,830
your evolutionary process, one by one, how you evolved,

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,270
through ages

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,470
to this stage of evolution.

33
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:15,470
And now after evolving up to the human stage,

34
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,310
what do we have to do?

35
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,870
So we come to right conclusions about ourselves first of all,

36
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,430
that we have to become something more,

37
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,630
something has to happen to us.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,150
Now so far in our evolution

39
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,630
whatever has happened, has happened in our awareness,

40
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,070
in Sanskrit called 'cheytana';

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,990
means, a horse can go through a dirty lane,

42
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,550
a dog can go through a dirty lane,

43
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,990
but a human being cannot, he just can’t bear it.

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,270
He’ll vomit, he’ll refuse,

45
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,230
he'll not accept at any cost to pass through something very filthy.

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,870
So our awareness towards dirt, filth, towards beauty,

47
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,910
has definitely got a new dimension.

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,950
And this new dimension that we have got is not sufficient enough

49
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,190
because still we have not understood why are we here,

50
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,750
why all this has been done

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,150
to create us into such a beautiful personality,

52
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,470
what is the purpose of this creation.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,150
And in this confusion only,

54
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,950
we really fall into the traps of not understanding

55
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,910
that there must be some power that does it.

56
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,710
It is very easy to deny the power of God

57
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,990
because who is there to challenge it?

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,830
Or who is going to say that "How dare you deny?"

59
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,110
Supposing you have a policeman, he is elected by you,

60
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,950
so you cannot overthrow him, or you have to listen to him.

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,550
But God is not elected by you,

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,790
He is appointed by Himself.

63
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,790
So as He is there you can always say whatever you like about Him.

64
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,150
But the same thing is to understand

65
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,470
that actually human beings don't do any work which is living.

66
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,550
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit.

67
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,590
Even one.

68
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,910
What we do is to take some dead things, make buildings,

69
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,310
make beautiful furniture, make these carpets, all manmade,

70
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,950
every sort of thing, and then we start thinking, “Oh, we are great”.

71
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,230
Even the science can only find whatever is available

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,550
or can be seen through these eyes or felt through these senses.

73
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,590
It cannot go beyond it, and even if it sometimes goes,

74
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,910
like the auras and all that they see, they cannot explain it.

75
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,630
For example if, if there is any doctor they will understand

76
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,270
that doctors are honest on this point,

77
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,310
that acetylene and adrenaline,

78
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,790
acetylcholine and adrenaline,

79
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,990
two chemicals - which are chemicals, just chemicals -

80
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,470
react differently in the body,

81
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,790
and they say that the mode of action of these two,

82
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,630
we cannot explain - why it is augmentation or why it is relaxation.

83
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,790
They admit it. So many things we have not been able to explain.

84
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,990
Now, if I say this is a beautiful instrument,

85
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:45,070
and it is fantastic to believe that we are great,

86
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,390
I would just give another simple example,

87
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,790
that if you have to come to this room

88
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,510
and there is no light, I just tell you,

89
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,990
"All right, push that button and you will get lights everywhere".

90
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,310
Now it happens! It becomes a fantastic thing

91
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,790
for a person who has never seen electricity,

92
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,670
who has never known anything, who has no knowledge of electricity,

93
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,470
that only you press one button and you get it.

94
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,150
But behind all this organism,

95
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,790
behind all this working, all that is done,

96
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,230
there is a big history.

97
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,990
There are lots of people who have worked to achieve this.

98
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,310
People have sacrificed so much to achieve this,

99
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,710
but we are taking the benefit of that

100
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,670
as today we are enjoying electricity.

101
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,470
How many people must have died discovering it?

102
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,790
How many people must have sacrificed their life

103
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,310
for discovering the use of it for the masses?

104
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,310
In the same way we must understand that

105
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,550
maybe that we are something fantastic, reach a conclusion

106
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,550
that we have to just feel it.

107
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,070
And unless and until you feel that greatness within you,

108
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,630
you should not just deny that you can achieve it.

109
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,270
You have to achieve it!

110
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,550
Actually, if you do not achieve it

111
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,910
you will fall short of your evolution.

112
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,150
Today in the world if you see,

113
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,790
everywhere I go there are so many seekers, so many seekers!

114
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,230
Such a time was never there before, say about fifty years back

115
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,630
we did not know the word “seekers”.

116
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,830
People did not believe that there are seekers,

117
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,630
but today you find so many seekers all over the world.

118
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,830
They have gone to all kinds of other alternative things,

119
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,710
they have tried to find out if they can find truth

120
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,990
by altering their lives, by doing this or by doing that.

121
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,430
The reason is, they are not at all satisfied with what they see.

122
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,230
They are intelligent enough to see that it’s not the end

123
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,630
of our lives and we don’t live just for insurances.

124
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,910
Now, then one starts thinking

125
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,310
that if these are the seekers in this world,

126
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,990
why so many have come on this earth?

127
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,070
This is a special time, already predicted

128
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,790
thousands and thousands of years back.

129
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,630
In every kind of prediction they have talked about it.

130
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,710
There was a book called 'Nadi Granth', written

131
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,430
you can’t say how many years back, but was revised

132
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,910
only three hundred years back by another person called Bhujander.

133
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,790
Now this Nadi Granth is written by a person

134
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,230
who is actually the starting point of astrology in India,

135
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,470
the one who started. The whole astrology has been started from India

136
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,830
and this is the man, Bhrigu, who did it.

137
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,710
And he wrote this Nadi Granth in which he has described -

138
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,110
according to him, he said it in Sanskrit language

139
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,830
but was again translated and brought to up to date level,

140
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,790
that in 1970 something will happen,

141
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,630
a personality will come on this earth who will

142
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,390
give realization to thousands of people by a sahaja method.

143
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,830
It’s clearly written down, you’ll be amazed to know that it is so,

144
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,470
because we have a book,

145
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,390
in that book all these prophecies are written.

146
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,590
And what will happen? The Kundalini will rise

147
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,990
and people will get their realization.

148
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,150
To Indians, Kundalini is not a new knowledge.

149
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,630
Of course, there are some people who went from

150
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,070
other countries and tried to study about Kundalini.

151
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,190
Now when such people come to India

152
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,630
they do not reach the roots at all.

153
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,030
They are just caught up by people who want to make money out of them

154
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,750
or to mislead them.

155
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,990
It’s a big market there for all such things.

156
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,270
And now when these people also came,

157
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,430
specially the Germans, when they came to India,

158
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,990
they were caught up into such mess

159
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,910
and they were given books which were nothing but

160
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,310
just the opposite of what Kundalini is.

161
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,230
It’s about the people who are doing tantrism.

162
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,710
And tantrism is a system in which people do anti-God activity.

163
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,590
With anti-God activity you get all kinds of

164
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,270
horrible experiences of God and the Kundalini,

165
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,990
and they have described all of them,

166
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,470
as if they are the real effects of Kundalini.

167
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,150
It's like the knowledge of a naive villager coming

168
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,110
and putting his hand into the holes of a plug

169
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,830
and saying that electricity gives you a big shock.

170
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,950
So, it is even worse than that

171
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,470
because Kundalini never gives you trouble.

172
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,430
She is your mother.

173
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,470
She is settled down here in the triangular bone, as you see,

174
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,630
is called as 'sacrum'.

175
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,910
Now this sacrum bone is - sacrum means sacred.

176
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,790
And when I ask people,

177
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,630
that how is it that this bone is called as sacred in Greek?

178
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,990
When I went to Greece I asked the people,

179
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,110
“Why do you call this a sacrum?”

180
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,550
Then they told Me that they had a report long time back,

181
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,030
before Alexander went to India,

182
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,550
and there was a report between Indo-Aryan groups

183
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,790
and they told that this bone should be called as 'sacrum'.

184
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,790
Now imagine that this bone specially

185
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,630
should be called as sacrum and no other bone.

186
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,150
So this bone has got this three and a half coiled energy,

187
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,310
settled down inside there.

188
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,830
Now, some of these books that I’ve read,

189
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,910
such big books written on Kundalini -

190
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,990
some of them say the Kundalini is here, somebody says in the nose,

191
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,630
somebody says somewhere else -

192
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,470
means they are just, just using the ignorance of people

193
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,150
to print something, write something, and just mislead them,

194
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,150
to make some money out of these books.

195
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,550
So far I’ve not written any book.

196
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,550
I am sorry, I’ve not yet done any of that work so far.

197
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,830
But anything can be written in the book.

198
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,110
Whatever is written in the book is not the truth

199
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,870
and you should not accept it.

200
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,910
How much does it take to print a book?

201
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,630
You people are living in such an advanced country.

202
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,070
You know it hardly takes anything to write a book about anything,

203
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,390
especially about God and His work.

204
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,630
Because even, you'll be amazed that Hitler used to talk about God,

205
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,750
Napoleon used to talk about God.

206
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,070
All these horrible people used to talk about God,

207
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,270
and sometimes they believed that God was in their favour

208
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,990
because they thought they were rather successful.

209
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,910
Now, these books or whatever they have told you, is not true.

210
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,790
This is the truth, that the Kundalini lies in your sacred bone,

211
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,630
called sacrum.

212
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,430
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini at the time

213
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,910
when the Kundalini is raised. Not in everyone,

214
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,150
if you have got a blockage

215
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,430
in that another center that is there,

216
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,070
or the upper, this centre, then this Kundalini - because

217
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,630
this is the pure desire of becoming one with God.

218
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,150
This is the purest desire which you have

219
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,710
and when it is awakened it makes an effort, a tremendous effort.

220
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,070
But I have seen some people have Kundalinis which are just hurt,

221
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,150
like a beaten up snake, you see, it just tosses.

222
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,830
It tosses itself on all the sides and tries to get out

223
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,390
but it cannot because the gentleman or the seeker

224
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,470
who has got this Kundalini within himself, his own mother,

225
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,030
has hurt Her so much that She cannot raise her head,

226
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,790
she is very tired and she wants the supply of pure energy to rise.

227
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,270
So when people are here I have to tell you one thing, that

228
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,550
it’s nice that you have come for realization, you should take it.

229
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,790
But you can’t demand it, you can’t demand it.

230
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,430
For today I found one gentleman was just shaking before Me like this.

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,230
All the time. So he said, “Why am I shaking before You?”

232
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,630
I said, “Because your nerves are out. You are a nervous person.

233
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,070
That’s why you are shaking. All your nerves are out,

234
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,150
I have to steady them, otherwise the Kundalini won’t rise

235
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,310
and you won’t feel the cool breeze,

236
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,550
because Kundalini is now attending to those nerve centers

237
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,790
which are absolutely overdone.

238
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,270
They are absolutely fagged out and tired."

239
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,630
He is a young man, about twenty five years,

240
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,830
I am an old woman, but I said, “Look at my hands, are not shaking.

241
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,230
Why should your hands shake like an old man

242
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,550
of eighty years all the time? You must think about it."

243
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,630
Why should they think it should happen?

244
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:38,110
So this is what it is, that some people get it.

245
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,550
Most of them get it. But some cannot get it.

246
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,310
Now the attitude should be little different

247
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,150
from what you have towards anybody else.

248
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,070
Here you have to get something out of Me.

249
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,990
You have to make use of Me.

250
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,230
Not that I have to use you for any purpose whatsoever.

251
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,070
It should be clear cut that you are asking for something.

252
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,230
You deserve it, no doubt!

253
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,630
It’s like you go to the bank, all right,

254
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,470
there’s a banker sitting there.

255
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,270
If you have some money in the bank,

256
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,030
you can go and talk to him but you can’t be rude with the banker.

257
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,710
You have to say, "All right, I have got this money with you,

258
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,230
please may I have?”

259
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,790
Now the Grace of God is so gracious,

260
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,230
that it gives you manifold much more

261
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,150
than what you have really reserved in the bank.

262
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,350
I can see that working out so well.

263
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,790
So we have to understand that we are made in our own glory,

264
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,550
God has made us a fantastic thing,

265
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,630
we are a great instrument that has to receive it's blessings.

266
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,910
And as this instrument is put to the mains,

267
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,870
once you put to your mains,

268
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,990
you will be surprised how fantastic you are.

269
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,310
It’s amazing how people are not aware of themselves.

270
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,190
It is amazing how people do not know,

271
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,630
how precious they are to the Divine.

272
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,910
Human beings are the epitome of this creation.

273
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,470
Forget the moon, forget the sun, forget this earth,

274
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,630
everything is nothing, it’s at your feet.

275
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,310
You are the highest that God has created

276
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,230
and the way we fritter away our life for nothing at all,

277
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,150
for superficial things, is something very, very surprising.

278
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,990
We are not at all aware that how much the nature has worked for us,

279
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,790
to make us human beings.

280
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,630
And once you realize that you are the Spirit -

281
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,150
realize doesn’t mean

282
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,630
that you just realize it through a mental process,

283
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,230
it is a happening within you, which takes place. You become that!

284
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,270
And once you become that, you’ll be amazed

285
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,630
that your becoming will prove that you are really the epitome,

286
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,790
you are the meaning, you are everything

287
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,910
and without you, the creation has no meaning at all.

288
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,790
It’s like a tree which has now the flowers,

289
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,710
and they have to become the fruits,

290
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,390
otherwise the tree has no meaning at all.

291
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:12,150
But whatever we do mentally is artificial.

292
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,790
Because it has no roots attached to it,

293
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,150
it has no moorings to it.

294
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,230
Now your, say your politics or your economics, all is artificial.

295
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,390
But in that also you can find a lot of truth.

296
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,230
For example, economics says that wants in general are not satiable.

297
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,510
Individual wants can be satisfied,

298
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,750
but wants in general are not satiable,

299
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,070
means this matter cannot give us satisfaction.

300
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,190
If it could then we would have been satisfied with one thing,

301
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,150
but we buy one thing, then we buy, want to buy another thing

302
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,790
and then we want to buy another thing and still we are

303
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,790
the most dissatisfied souls ever living on this earth.

304
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,510
Now economics another, then politics we can see,

305
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,630
is that people talk of say, communism, they talk of socialism,

306
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,150
they talk of democracy, of capitalism.

307
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,230
It's also artificial to Me, it's just a play of human beings.

308
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,910
Because when you say you are a capitalist - what is your capital?

309
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,630
This you can’t take with you. It's of no use.

310
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,230
You don’t want to share it. What's the use of such a capital?

311
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,430
While I would say I am a capitalist

312
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,790
because I have all the powers within Myself.

313
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,430
And I am the greatest communist

314
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,910
because I can't live without sharing it. I just can’t help it.

315
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,510
You see, people can’t understand Me.

316
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,630
They think, "You are a nicely married lady,

317
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,470
your husband is such a nice person, is such a nice gentleman,

318
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,870
he loves you so much, he cares for you so much.

319
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,190
You are a grandmother,you are a mother and why are You doing all this

320
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,550
and running about everywhere, talking to people?

321
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,710
They can’t understand this communism which is so important to Me

322
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,630
that I cannot get My joy without sharing it with others.

323
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,150
It's something which people have to gradually take in

324
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,630
and once they take in, they become themselves.

325
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,550
It’s my job that I have to give you what you have.

326
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,910
It’s your own. I do not do anything about it,

327
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,230
it's your own. All you are built in that way.

328
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,990
Only thing what I do, like a candle which is enlightened

329
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,550
can enlighten any other candle, which is ready.

330
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,150
But some people will escape saying, “I’m not ready”.

331
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,790
Now, you let Me find out if you are ready or not.

332
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,190
That’s another side of it.

333
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,990
“Mother, we are sinners, we are not ready.”

334
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,110
Now you let Me do the job for you.

335
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,030
I may be able to put the candle right.

336
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,630
Why do you condemn yourself? This is the other side of it.

337
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,830
Sometimes people get into ego moods

338
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,310
and sometimes they get into such a superego mood

339
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,630
that they say,” Mother, oh we are no good, we are sinners,

340
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,390
we have done this, we have done that.” Now forget it!

341
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,790
If I don’t know the job then I better not do it.

342
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,870
But I think I know it, I have done it.

343
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,910
So let Me do it, and let us see if I can give what you have.

344
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,710
Because that is supposed to be God’s promise, that

345
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,270
you have to get your resurrection,

346
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,150
that you have to become self-realized, that you are to be born again

347
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,110
and all this has been done within you with this aim

348
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,670
and is not to be wasted.

349
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,550
I don’t know how many in Melbourne are going to get it.

350
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,910
How many are going to get it in Sydney, that’s besides the point.

351
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,230
It depends on how much you care for yourself.

352
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,630
But wherever I go I will try my level best to do it.

353
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,950
Now, how I cure people and what happens -

354
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,110
actually curing is not at all My job,

355
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,190
it's just a by-product by which you get cured completely.

356
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,190
Because once you get your absolute and you get to the source

357
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,630
which is all pervading, which starts flowing through you,

358
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,990
then your problem is solved.

359
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,830
You never get exhausted, you never get upset.

360
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,870
It’s all solved. The whole energy works it out.

361
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,150
So the compassion that people talk of

362
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,870
that we are very compassionate

363
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,390
and we are very peace loving and all that, is so superficial.

364
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,790
This is the compassion that it works.

365
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,150
It works, it doesn’t talk, it just works.

366
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,470
This is the peace that exists,

367
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,230
that you feel is expressed within you and without.

368
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,910
A person of that calibre

369
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,150
if he stays with other people who are turbulent,

370
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,830
who are volcanic, who are violent,

371
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,550
they become peaceful. It works.  That’s what it is.

372
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:32,310
You must know that whatever people are saying to you, it must work.

373
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,630
Like going to other gurus, to other people,

374
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,710
you should know that it has not given you any power of your own.

375
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,910
Leave alone whatever they have to say about Me,

376
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,150
I am this, I am that, I am that. Forget it.

377
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,070
What I am saying, what are you?

378
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,550
You have to receive your own significance.

379
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,390
You have to understand your own meaning

380
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,190
and if it works in you then it’s all right.

381
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,630
That’s what you should ask anyone if you go to and say that

382
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,310
“Can you give me my own powers, not your powers?”

383
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,990
You may be very great and you might be doing something.

384
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,710
But people are so ridiculously superficial,

385
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,470
so ridiculously superficial that a person if he buys

386
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,430
fifty-eight Rolls Royce out of the money of loots that they have,

387
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,430
out of these people who go to them,

388
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,150
we think “Oh, he has fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

389
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,390
He, such a man can impress these English

390
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,670
who could not be impressed by anything else,

391
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,190
if he has a big cavalcade or a big procession

392
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,550
of these fifty-eight looted Rolls Royce on the road,

393
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,710
then people say, “Oh! what a guru he is,

394
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,470
he’s got fifty-eight Rolls Royce.”

395
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,550
Yes, you won’t believe, and he wanted to have the fifty-ninth one.

396
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,110
And he went away to America.

397
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,430
And he wrote a letter saying that

398
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,230
"If you give me the fifty-ninth I’ll come".

399
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,750
The poor boys, you see,

400
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,830
they suffered, they ate only potatoes, they starved themselves.

401
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,710
They have - they are fifty thousand still in U.K.,

402
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:05,110
absolutely cabbages, lost people, absolutely lost.

403
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,870
You can’t talk to them. They shake when you go before them.

404
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,470
They can’t understand, it is all finished there,

405
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,790
nothing, they are all lost people.

406
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,470
And if you go and tell them “How can you

407
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,390
get a Rolls Royce for a sadhu? He's a sanyasi, he says.

408
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,590
How can you give him a Rolls Royce?”

409
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,270
So they say, “We have got the Spirit”,

410
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,990
means some spirit has possessed them, you see,

411
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,830
“We have got the Spirit and we have to give just metal.

412
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,630
What is in Rolls Royce? Is metal."

413
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,070
But why don’t they think, why does the guru

414
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,070
think that this metal is precious?

415
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,350
You see, we don’t use our brains at all when you go to gurus,

416
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,430
surprisingly. If he says, "I will make you fly".

417
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,070
All right, at least you should ask the guru to fly.

418
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,350
Why not make him fly and see if he can fly or not.

419
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,150
At least minimum of minimum that he should do, isn’t it?

420
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,750
But that also we never do, we just accept it.

421
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,230
Because he has a big organisation and he has a big publicity,

422
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,750
because you can pass through seven rooms to reach him and all that.

423
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,230
He creates a feeling, and then you think “Oh, it’s great to fly”.

424
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,310
And if somebody says that, "Go and ask that guru to fly",

425
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,350
people don’t like it. They don’t want to hear anything about it.

426
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,070
And then you pay thousands and thousands of pounds to them.

427
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,910
You end up as penniless people, as epileptic people,

428
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,470
and you can’t understand what wrong it was.

429
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,470
You didn’t use your brains!

430
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,790
You didn’t use your brains I would say.

431
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,310
I know, I must condemn all these devilish people

432
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,470
who have ruined so many seekers because they are seeking truth.

433
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,350
They are my children, they’re my own, I know.

434
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,710
I feel very sorry for them. You don’t know how much I want to work,

435
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,470
that I should save all of them, but

436
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,150
I also should tell you that this is your mistake, you misunderstand.

437
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,150
You don’t know that you can’t pay for your realization,

438
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,230
you can’t pay for God.

439
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,910
Christ was bought for 30 rupees.

440
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,910
It's a very good example to understand.

441
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,790
He was bought to be killed.

442
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,470
Another example is that when people were selling some things

443
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,310
in the temple, He took a big whip and whipped them,

444
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,270
absolutely in a great temper. Who said on the cross, that

445
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,990
“Please God forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”

446
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:30,790
But now it is so sad that if you do like that

447
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,150
you won’t be able to forgive yourself.

448
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,150
Christ maybe, but you may not be able to forgive yourself

449
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,830
for doing all these mistakes and committing such horrible injuries

450
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,310
upon yourself and troubling your Kundalini to that extent.

451
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,390
This Self-realization you have been seeking for ages, many lives.

452
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,870
You have been seekers for many lives and the time has come,

453
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,790
this great time of resurrection, the great time of your judgement.

454
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,470
At this time you should take it, take it up

455
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,710
that you have to be self-realized! Only this is my message to you.

456
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,990
I hope you will understand it. May God bless you.

457
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,630
I would like you to ask Me some questions

458
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,030
because today is the first day. But ask relevant questions.

459
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,870
Some people, you see, just ask questions just to show off.

460
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,270
Then I would say they should take another hall

461
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,990
to give a lecture there. But normally -

462
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,870
yes, some people start giving another lecture to Me, you see,

463
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,310
and instead of My lecture, I have to listen to their lecture,

464
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,350
which has no relevance to it, you see.

465
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,110
So I would request you not to waste others’ time. Be civil to them,

466
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,070
and ask questions which are relevant to the subject.

467
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,990
Thank you very much.

468
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,910
Right. Any questions?

469
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,550
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

470
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,470
Keep the cane on one side.

471
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,550
Each night Mataji is going to be speaking here.

472
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,350
She’ll be talking tomorrow night about

473
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,150
the centers that lie up to the heart,

474
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,790
and the next night the centers that lie to the Sahasrara,

475
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,710
in particular the chakra of the Sahasrara.

476
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,150
So, any particular questions about the individual centers within us,

477
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,390
We can ask tomorrow.
she’ll be explaining on a day-by-day basis.

478
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,830
So any questions thus far?

479
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,790
I'd like to know if having a vertebrae in the spine out of place

480
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,550
interferes with the rising of the Kundalini?

481
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,030
Does having a vertebrae out of place in the spine

482
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,390
interfere with the rising of Kundalini?

483
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,830
It does to some extent, it does.

484
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,070
Definitely it does, but we can put it right.

485
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,070
The vertebrae can be put right and the Kundalini can be brought in.

486
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,990
It does. So many things do happen, if you have -

487
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,190
you are a person over read;

488
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,790
if you have read too many books and the books are in your head,

489
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,070
I have to empty that also.

490
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,150
I actually do this work as a profession and I find that

491
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,550
if the subtle center is fixed, the spinal problems just disappear.

492
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,830
I used to have three and four adjustments a week,

493
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,150
to correct my spine and now I have none at all.

494
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,630
So first fix the subtle within us and then the gross part,

495
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,990
the spinal misalignments and so on, will just get better.

496
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,070
Any others?

497
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,870
May I ask another question?
Yes.

498
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,790
Do you feel that there can be a difference between, in marriage,

499
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,470
that people can be married on earth, in a seemingly holiness,

500
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,310
that there is really a difference in a marriage of souls,

501
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,070
than there is in many marriages, so-called marriages.

502
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,990
[...]

503
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:31,070
I’m not too sure, but, earthly marriages which seem to be ok,

504
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,630
but - did you saying a mismarriage of souls?

505
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,390
Perhaps, but maybe there is some sort of

506
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,310
mismarriage in some way of souls of those same people.

507
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,470
Can there be a perfectly “normal” - as we call it, earthly marriage,

508
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:52,990
and perhaps a mismarriage of souls, in a heavenly sense?

509
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,550
You see the Spirit in every being is perfect.

510
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,830
Everybody’s Spirit is perfect. There’s no imperfection with it.

511
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,550
But some people have a more reflection of the Spirit

512
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,990
in their character, and some people don’t have.

513
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:18,150
They have more darkness and more we can say,

514
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,630
outward look or materialistic you can call them,

515
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,630
or you can call them, they are over-romantic type,

516
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,710
any sort of thing which is outside. But doesn’t matter.

517
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,110
We have seen people who have been married before,

518
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,150
they said they are mal-adjusted.

519
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,230
I would say ninety percent such marriages are now doing well.

520
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,550
But maybe, there could be terrible difference also

521
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,550
between the two persons, as you say. It's possible.

522
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,630
But that is to be seen. Just now you should not worry about it.

523
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,070
If there is any mal-adjustment, it might be put right.

524
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,910
If it doesn’t work out

525
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:59,390
then you have to work out the correction as far as possible.

526
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,990
See it is said 'Karmanye vadhikaraste',

527
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,670
is that with which we can do the work.

528
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,390
We can work it out as far as possible.

529
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,230
But if it doesn’t work, forget it. That’s it.

530
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,230
But once you are a realised soul,

531
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,910
you become so congenial, so tolerant, so understanding.

532
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,830
Actually your being itself corrects the other person.

533
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,390
But maybe some people can be such gone cases,

534
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,630
that whatever you may try they may not come back.

535
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,710
So it's not important to worry about those things.

536
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,070
We’ll see later on how the thing is

537
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,990
and how it has to be worked out, all right?

538
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,910
Could You please explain more about the realization process

539
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,390
when it comes out of the top of your head.

540
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:49,710
Could You explain Self-realization, and in particular

541
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,550
how it manifests on your hands

542
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,710
and how it comes out of the top of your head.

543
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,710
It just comes out.

544
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,950
You see, how will you explain

545
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,150
how does a primule or the germ of a seed comes out?

546
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,870
It’s like that, it’s a living process as I said.

547
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,150
The Kundalini rises and when She enlightens all other centers

548
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,550
She passes through them and then when She comes up here,

549
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,550
at this point, this point is very important in human beings,

550
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,430
is bestowed or, we can say the -

551
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,870
it is governed by the deity of Lord Jesus Christ.

552
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,910
And He sucks in these two institutions called ego and super-ego.

553
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,630
By that there’s an opening made and the Kundalini just

554
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,990
jets out and you can feel it coming out of your head.

555
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,470
This is the actualisation of baptism. It’s not something artificial,

556
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,510
that you take water and put it on somebody’s head and say that

557
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:55,710
"you are baptised" and hear the child is screaming with that baptism.

558
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:02,230
So it’s an actualisation, it’s a living process, how it works.

559
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,310
But while rising of course lots of things happen, like the

560
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:13,550
chakras go into various moods, they try to sustain the Kundalini,

561
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,230
they try to keep it there. All these things happen.

562
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,990
These happen when the Kundalini is awakened, not before that.

563
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,310
That’s why, like somebody talks of Raja Yoga,

564
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,030
that you cut your tongue, push it back and do the 'kechari'

565
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:34,150
and by that you can raise your Kundalini. And it is absurd, you see.

566
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,190
Like the car has not started,

567
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,310
so you move the wheels and the car will start.

568
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,190
But when the Kundalini is rising,

569
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,990
this tongue is little bit pulled inside no doubt,

570
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,710
automatically. You don’t feel it also.

571
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,390
Slightly it is pulled inside and is released again.

572
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,870
But by cutting this tongue and putting it back

573
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,390
do you think the Kundalini will rise?

574
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,910
It's so superficial, it’s so artificial.

575
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,910
And that’s how they have done all these things.

576
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,950
Even now, for example Hatha Yoga that we do,

577
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,030
is -of course Hatha Yoga is ashtanga,

578
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,630
it is not only one that we call as yoga, is standing on your head,

579
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,790
It's not the only thing. It is ashtanga.

580
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,310
There are eight things and in that also, 'Ishvara pranidhana',

581
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,830
means the establishment of God, is the first thing.

582
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,430
Because before the Kundalini has started

583
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:20,310
if you start doing any exercises, you may be harming yourself.

584
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,430
Because you don’t know where is the problem.

585
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,110
Supposing you have a problem in the stomach

586
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,310
and you are doing the exercises of the nose, what’s the use?

587
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,230
You will spoil the nose as well as the stomach is already bad.

588
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,630
So it's very indiscriminate. It’s very scientific.

589
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,790
The mantras are the same thing. Where to say which mantras,

590
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,630
what chakras are catching, which deity is to be awakened,

591
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,790
we must know all the science behind it.

592
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,790
And everybody knows, there is no secret about it.

593
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,870
There is not the thing you come here inside,

594
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,950
and you will pay Me three hundred pounds and I'll give you a mantra.

595
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,470
All right, that mantra you are not to tell anybody,

596
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,630
because that mantra means nothing, you see.

597
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,030
There was a fellow who paid three hundred pounds,

598
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,350
and I asked him what was the mantra. He said “tinga”.

599
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,550
Now if you tell an Indian he will just laugh,

600
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,590
if he hears what it means, it means this.

601
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,910
Can you imagine such nonsense?

602
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,630
And don’t tell anybody! It’s a big Mafia.

603
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,070
Don’t tell anybody, just keep quiet.

604
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,710
If you tell anybody, then - because you have found out.

605
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,790
So you cannot give one mantra. Is another funny idea people have

606
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,550
that you just give one mantra to somebody.

607
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,710
Of course, I mean if you have a problem at a particular point

608
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,310
one can say that, "At this time you say this mantra to clear out".

609
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,910
But then later on you don’t go on with it.

610
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,230
Then you do the one which where you need, require. Isn’t it?

611
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,630
I'ts simple as that. Supposing you are suffering from some trouble,

612
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,910
we take medicine for that particular thing.

613
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,350
And then, when we are suffering from another trouble

614
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,550
we take another medicine for that particular thing.

615
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,470
We don’t go on taking the same medicine, whether it is anything.

616
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,630
So it is a very scientific knowledge,

617
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,390
which you will pick up in no time.

618
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,590
Eight days are sufficient to learn the whole of Sahaja Yoga.

619
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,070
Once you get your realisation, that’s the main point is.

620
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,790
Excuse me. Does meat eating interfere with all this?

621
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,990
What is it?

622
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,790
Does meat eating interfere with this process?

623
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,070
No, not at all, not at all. But you see, you have to understand,

624
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,630
what sort of a personality you are.

625
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,150
If you are the right sided personality then you should not eat meat,

626
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,830
you should take to something milder,

627
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,870
you can, I call them grass eating, you can do.

628
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,790
But if you have say, you are a left sided person,

629
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,510
then you have to take meat.

630
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,550
You see, I would say in general that

631
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,150
Australians should not eat so much meat as they eat.

632
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:49,150
They eat meat too much.They should take more vegetables.

633
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,030
But Indians should eat some meat

634
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,630
because otherwise they’ll become cowards.

635
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,070
So it is what sort of a personality it is.

636
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,230
I don’t know from where this idea has come,

637
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,710
that vegetarianism is going to take to God.

638
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,790
In India most of the people are vegetarians

639
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,790
because they can’t afford it, you see.

640
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,790
No, no, no, I don't care about that vegetarianism to take to God...

641
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,990
Now, yes, but it is not important for everyone. What I’m saying,

642
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,150
as it is, we have to understand, we have to be discreet,

643
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,830
we have to understand who needs what.

644
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,230
Everybody need not take vegetarian food.

645
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,830
Everybody need not take non-vegetarian food.

646
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,710
It’s the 'prakriti' they call it, nature of a person.

647
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,870
You must find out what is the nature of the person is.

648
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,030
If he, supposing he is suffering from high blood pressure,

649
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,390
and other things like that, he has to take to food which is,

650
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,950
which will control his, I mean which will give him another side;

651
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,630
means he should stop eating meats and things like that.

652
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,790
All right? So he, he balances himself, to balance himself.

653
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,950
The whole food theory is to be understood through

654
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,190
the understanding of your being first of all,

655
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,750
what sort of a being you are,

656
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,590
and what is lacking in you is to be supplemented.

657
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,830
So we just can’t say that,

658
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,470
now so many people now, and doctors if you go to them they’ll say,

659
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,830
“Cut down your sugar”, general. But it's absurd.

660
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,270
Sugar is very important for liver.

661
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,830
If you don’t take sugar I don’t know what will happen to you,

662
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,630
you will become like sticks, you see, absolutely like sticks.

663
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,190
If those people who are right-sided,if they don’t take sugar at all,

664
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,710
I don’t know what’s going to happen to them.

665
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,190
They'll be very irritable, hot-tempered,

666
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,910
absolutely stick-like people.They’ll hit you like a stick, you know.

667
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,790
So that’s something, a general statement like that,

668
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,910
is very dangerous, just not to have.

669
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,110
But what is the science behind it?

670
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,550
Carbohydrates are very important for the body,

671
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,830
especially if you are thinking too much,

672
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,790
if you are a futuristic person, if you are right sided,

673
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,910
it’s absolutely essential that you must have sufficient carbohydrates.

674
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,790
We have treated so many liver patients with sugar.

675
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,630
So this kind of a general statement even - sorry for,

676
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:55,310
I must say that doctors should not feel hurt,

677
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,910
but is a very general statement doctors also make.

678
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,790
No doubt about it, without going into it to find it,

679
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:06,070
it’s very easy to say, “Now you all should stop sugars.” Why?

680
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,910
Our forefathers ate sugars. They were healthier people than us,

681
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,710
I tell you. All of us are sick now, this way or the other.

682
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,270
If physically you are all right, mentally we are out.

683
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,270
If we are mentally out,

684
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,910
then we think that physically we are all right.

685
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,830
So we have a satisfaction but I think both are just the same.

686
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,390
So we have to be discreet in anything that we do.

687
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,430
It cannot be a fad, it cannot be an -ism,

688
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,270
it cannot be a hard and fast line.

689
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,150
It's all made for you. God has made everything for you.

690
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,550
You must understand what we should eat, what will suit us.

691
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,110
That is to be found out on a person,

692
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,310
what sort of a personality he is.

693
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,070
In our Sahaja Yoga many people take to vegetables,

694
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,350
and many people have to take to meat eating.

695
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,030
And by that they have improved their health very much.

696
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,550
He is one who was suffering from high blood pressure,

697
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,750
God knows how many things. He just dropped it like that.

698
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,310
And he keeps low on meats I think.

699
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:16,390
Do You find that today many people are more sicker, not to think of

700
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:22,070
they look older, seeking the health than fifty years ago and...

701
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,430
Do you find that more people today are sicker,

702
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,790
in general, than they were fifty years ago?

703
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,310
No doubt.

704
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,550
Why?

705
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,790
Because a time has come, to see.

706
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,790
This is the time you are born for this.

707
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,030
Many children are born realised these days, so many children.

708
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,270
Now we have in our ashram about nine children, very beautiful ones,

709
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,230
all born realised, absolutely they are.

710
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,830
You can talk to them better than you can talk to,

711
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,150
even a very well educated person.

712
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,270
When I talk to them I just find I am just one with them.

713
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,910
So this is the time, the resurrection time,

714
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,310
this is the time that is the Last Judgement, and that’s why

715
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,430
so many have taken birth for their judgement, all right?

716
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,630
No I didn't ask this kind of seeking.

717
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,470
I asked seeking the health, malaj.

718
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,990
Physically sickening.

719
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,190
She’s asking whether more people are sicker today

720
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,270
than they were fifty years ago. But I fear if the question is obvious.

721
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,190
so I think medical science and statistics have proven this,

722
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,830
so I don’t think there’s any question there.

723
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,070
No, no, but what’s she saying physically?

724
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,790
You want to know why, she wants to know why

725
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,070
Because you think they are physically sick, is it?

726
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,350
Your judgement, no. You see they are physically sick

727
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,910
because they have lost their roots.

728
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,150
They have gone to extremes and imbalances.

729
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,390
We cannot go to imbalance, you see.

730
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,430
Religion is to keep yourself in balance.

731
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,430
There are ten religions in the human being, like ten valencies.

732
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,070
As carbon has four valencies, we have ten valencies.

733
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,630
about which all the primordial masters

734
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,110
who came on this earth have taught.

735
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,110
Like Lao Tze, like Socrates,

736
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:12,270
we can say Abraham, Moses and many in India also.

737
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,190
They came and told us that we should keep the balance,

738
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,430
balance our life, keep in the center for the ascent.

739
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,350
If you are not balanced you cannot ascend.

740
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,630
But people have gone to extremes. They are faddists.

741
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,990
Whatever you tell them, if you tell them that see,

742
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,550
"now you are not well, so you do something."

743
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:37,030
They will do it so much that they’ll outwit everything, you see.

744
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,550
They always go to the extreme of everything.

745
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,790
So, that’s how the problems are there. But doesn’t matter.

746
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,150
But moreover we are sick because we are seeking,

747
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,630
because we are not satisfied.

748
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,790
We feel unhappy, we can’t sleep, we don’t know why we are living.

749
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,310
Is the other way round.

750
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,350
We are not seeking because we are sick,

751
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,310
but we are sick because we are seeking.

752
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,910
Why is the Kundalini identified with female form?

753
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,710
What?

754
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,390
Why is Kundalini identified as a female form?

755
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,630
Because it is the Power of God,

756
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,950
and God is regarded as "He",

757
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,310
and the Kundalini as the Mother.

758
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:31,310
He as the Father, and the Holy Ghost as the Mother.

759
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,830
She’s the Holy Ghost.

760
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,110
So because He’s the Father, we have to have a lady with Him.

761
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,070
So we call Her the Mother.

762
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,430
And one should not feel bad about it,

763
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,030
men should not feel bad at all because you all had a mother.

764
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,430
You could not have come on this earth without a mother.

765
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,470
You just can’t help it, that’s how the nature is.

766
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,830
You have to accept the fact.

767
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,790
Mother is a surety, isn’t it?

768
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,030
Yes, please.

769
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,790
Just first he and then you.

770
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,110
Does Mother have a guru and

771
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,910
what point did She gained Self-realization?

772
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,270
Do you have a guru and at what stage

773
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,430
did You receive Self-realization?

774
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,430
I neither have a guru nor I want you to have a guru.

775
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,950
You better become your own gurus.

776
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,230
Secondly I’ve been born like that,

777
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,630
I never got any realization or anything.

778
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,630
I just got realization, I should say human realization

779
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,870
when I understood what was the problem with human beings.

780
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:34,230
I worked on the all permutations and combinations of human beings,

781
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,190
because I wanted to have an en-masse media,

782
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,990
by which I could give realization to thousands of people.

783
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,390
Because any discovery which is made and is not brought to that level

784
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:50,750
it is absolutely detrimental to the growth.

785
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,950
For example, you see, Jesus was crucified. Why?

786
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,630
Because He was alone! Only for His mother, nobody knew what He was.

787
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,790
At that time He could not achieve this,

788
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,990
because you all were not there at the time.

789
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:11,630
And also other people - you know how the saints have suffered,

790
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,470
how every prophet has suffered because

791
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:18,350
because they could not create a mass understanding of it.

792
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,990
So at a certain point it has to become a mass thing.

793
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,830
In the tree of life there are only three or four

794
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,790
flowers in the beginning, but when it grows,

795
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,910
when the blossom time comes, then so many flowers are there

796
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,630
and they become the fruits.

797
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:40,550
So I, I just saw that this is the time I have to do this job.

798
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:43,350
So you would call it My "human" realization

799
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,910
when I understood human beings.

800
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,950
Of course even now sometimes I get shocked the way they behave,

801
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:55,950
I mean, I just don’t understand, but I think now I understand them.

802
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,470
So those people who can’t quite understand that answer,

803
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,870
don’t think about it too much.

804
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,710
There's another gentlemen who was asking a question.

805
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,790
Mother has to be somebody special, but find out for yourself.

806
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:11,150
That’s the best way.
You don’t worry about Me, you worry about yourself.

807
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,190
I must be someone, all right. Even if I’m not, doesn’t matter.

808
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,470
If you are going to get it, why not have it?

809
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:19,550
Who? The gentlemen there. Yes, please.

810
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,190
Is that phase that You've given today, tomorrow, next day,

811
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:25,910
I think on the [unclear] to call wholly

812
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,070
or it just continues, or it stops like this.

813
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:33,310
No, tonight She just gave an introductory lecture.

814
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,110
Tomorrow night and the next night

815
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,390
She will cover completely the subtle body.

816
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,390
All right.

817
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,070
The whole system.

818
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,630
But You shouldn’t come late tomorrow.

819
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,910
What if we can't get the three days?

820
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,950
What is she saying?

821
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,470
If you can’t get the three days and you seriously want

822
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,150
to settle into it, the film is being taken. They'll be showing it.

823
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,790
But why are you worried? Let us see for the present.

824
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:03,230
Why should be in the future? You will get it. Why not?

825
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,950
Why makes you, what makes you think,

826
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,190
if you don’t get it, you are not going to miss it.

827
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,790
We have people here,

828
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,390
we have luckily an ashram, a beautiful place, you’ll like it,

829
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,910
you can go there, they will give it to you.

830
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,190
Listen, may I ask a question please?

831
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,950
Yes.

832
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:25,230
What is the first step to Self-realization?

833
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,830
What is the first step to Self-realization?

834
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,230
There is nothing like first, second. It's not a course, you see.

835
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:38,910
The Kundalini, it's an awakening within us which takes place,

836
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,710
which is like a living process. All right?

837
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,150
So the Kundalini rises and shoots off here.

838
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:51,310
Now, some people feel the Kundalini wobbling down there, down below.

839
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,030
Some people feel it in the stomach.

840
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,870
Some people feel it here; some people feel it here;

841
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:01,830
but most of them feel it here only, jetting out like cool breeze.

842
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,990
So you just can’t say what is the first step,

843
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,870
depends on how it rises.

844
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,390
So, everybody doesn’t feel the same way,

845
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,230
So I can’t say that this is the first stage. All right?

846
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,990
Of course first you feel thoughtlessly aware.

847
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,510
You become thoughtlessly aware, first thing that should happen to you

848
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,830
when the Kundalini crosses this center.

849
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,230
When it comes out of it, you start feeling the cool breeze here,

850
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,110
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

851
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,470
and you start feeling the cool breeze around.

852
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,550
That’s the second stage where it can go

853
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,270
but some people really are so great

854
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,550
that they become absolutely doubtlessly aware,

855
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,750
what we call as Nirvikalpa. They achieve that.

856
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,070
Some of them are really, they are just there.

857
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,350
They are so beautifully made that they just become that.

858
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:55,950
There’s no question left in their mind but they become so powerful.

859
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,150
I’m amazed sometimes how they become so solid,

860
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,630
really understanding themselves.

861
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,310
So there are some people, I've known, who are very, very great

862
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,550
and they just start emitting vibrations,

863
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:12,150
they start giving realization, they start curing people.

864
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,230
They can do it!

865
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,790
So don’t condemn yourself in any way.

866
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,870
That’s first condition in Sahaja Yoga.

867
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,790
So should we now have realization?

868
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:27,190
Those people are sitting very much behind

869
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:31,630
should come in line with others, will be better idea.

870
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,470
Yes, just move in, as much as possible, nearer.

871
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,790
If you just slip your shoes off it helps you to...

872
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,630
Yes, it is much better, because this Mother Earth helps you.

873
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:48,310
Better to take out your shoes, will help.

874
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,550
If some people want to sit on the ground, also it’s all right,

875
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:58,190
but you should not be very far away

876
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,910
because it’s better to attend to them. All right?

877
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,830
If there are chairs here, yes.

878
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,150
There are plenty there.

879
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,150
Good.

880
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,350
There are plenty of chairs here.

881
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,790
The children can come here, come along, come and sit here.

882
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:17,630
There’s a lot of room for the children. Children are the best.

883
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,150
I’m very happy to see them here.

884
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,630
All right, come along, sit down, sit down. Please come along.

885
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,790
Look at their confidence! Sit down. Oh, great.

886
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,430
Just slip your shoes off.

887
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,390
Just slip out your shoes, all right? Great people.

888
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,310
You too, you too. Yes, please take out his shoes.

889
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:43,550
Just help him. You see, look at him, how he is alert.

890
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,430
There are so many children as I told you, are realised souls.

891
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,470
And we have to understand them. All right.

892
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,870
So now, you have to just put your hands towards Me like this.

893
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,790
Simple. Put your both the feet on the ground.

894
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,870
Touch the Mother Earth with your feet, just. And be relaxed.

895
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:09,830
You are not to do anything that will make you tense,

896
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,790
means if you have anything tight here, or tight there just loosen it.

897
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,350
Do not tighten your body also too much, don’t push back your head,

898
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,790
or push forward, just be in a relaxed way, sit straight.

899
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,350
Put your hands towards Me like this.

900
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,870
And as I said the first condition is,

901
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:35,350
to say that “Mother I am not guilty”, at least sixteen times.

902
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,910
Is a punishment for people who feel that way.

903
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:45,550
Before we start, let us tell ourselves that we are not guilty,

904
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:49,990
because I am talking of God Almighty.

905
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,390
He is the source of all joy,

906
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,190
but He is the ocean of love,

907
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:58,830
He’s the ocean of forgiveness,

908
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,230
He’s the ocean of compassion.

909
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,910
And what mistakes can we commit?

910
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:09,790
So don’t start with your guilt at all. You are all God’s people,

911
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,790
you must get your realization.

912
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,110
So, just tell yourself,

913
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,150
closing your eyes, in your heart,

914
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,710
“Mother I am not guilty”. You say it sixteen times,

915
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,550
is the best way, because there are sixteen petals here,

916
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,790
and this is the center gets blocked if you feel guilty.

917
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,550
Please close your eyes, and don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

918
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,230
Now, just close your eyes, see.

919
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,630
Do you feel the cool breeze in your hand? The children?

920
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,270
Yes, that’s it. The children are already feeling it,

921
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,310
all born-realised. Just imagine.

922
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:56,230
Look at that. You should, you should have brought our children also,

923
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:02,070
so sweet they are. Are you feeling?

924
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:07,230
Good. You are all realised souls, that’s why you’ve come here.

925
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:13,790
Now, the left hand, as I said, is the power of desire,

926
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,790
so you put it towards Me, left side.

927
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,430
That means you have to desire your realization.

928
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,830
Keep it comfortably on your lap, it’s all right.

929
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,470
Now, the right hand represents the power of action,

930
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,630
so we have to use right hand to symbolically suggest

931
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,030
our desire through this action.

932
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,830
First of all put your right hand - don’t open your eyes,

933
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,270
please don’t open your eyes at any cost, that’s important.

934
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,990
Because if you open your eyes,

935
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,990
the Kundalini won’t rise above Agnya Chakra.

936
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,830
Now put your right hand on your heart.

937
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,150
Don’t worry about anything, whether you are going to get it or not,

938
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,870
but just put it - put little -

939
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,430
sit little straight, you should not slouch down, yes.

940
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,550
Put your - please put it on your heart.

941
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:11,750
And now say in your heart that “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

942
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,630
Ask a question.

943
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,550
Because Spirit resides in the heart.

944
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:28,110
Just ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

945
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,470
Ask three times.

946
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,230
It's cool.

947
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:45,630
Now put down your right hand on your stomach, on the left-hand side.

948
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,830
Now this is your guru principle, is your master principle,

949
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:50,910
which has to be awakened.

950
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:55,710
So you say, ten times,

951
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,550
“Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own master.”

952
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:06,630
Just assert it, it's there. You just have to say it before Me.

953
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,110
“I am my own master.”

954
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,190
If you have been to some gurus or anything,

955
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,550
it will be all neutralised with it.

956
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,710
So just say “Mother, I am my own master.”

957
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:23,230
Because these gurus, actually kill that Spirit in you,

958
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:27,230
kill that principle in you.

959
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:37,310
Please say it ten times.

960
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,550
Now again raise your right hand to your heart.

961
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,990
And now with full confidence in yourself,

962
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:54,150
because as you know, you are the temple of God,

963
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,910
say that “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

964
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,990
Say it twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

965
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,230
It's on the Void. You put your hand.

966
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:33,390
All right. You can use the light behind Me. You put that.

967
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:41,750
Now, raise the same hand higher, onto the forehead.

968
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:46,790
We have missed one center where you had to say

969
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,790
“Mother I’m not guilty”. Because the Spirit cannot be guilty.

970
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:54,550
It is sinless. But here at this point

971
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,150
you have to say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

972
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,150
Now some of them said that “Mother it is difficult to forgive.”

973
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:07,230
But it is a myth that you are not forgiving. It’s absolutely myth.

974
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,310
You are doing nothing to that person who has harmed you,

975
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,430
or to those persons who have harmed you.

976
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,270
You are just harming yourself.

977
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,150
So just put your hand across,

978
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,950
hold it tight and say “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

979
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:24,150
Hold it, just press it a little bit from both the sides.

980
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,990
Hold it properly and just press it.

981
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:32,710
Squeeze in, I think, towards the center,

982
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:39,310
so that all extremes will disappear in the center.

983
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:46,630
Now put this hand on top of your head,

984
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,030
near the fontanelle bone area,

985
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:54,070
where you had a very soft bone as a child.

986
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,990
Try to press it with your palm.

987
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:02,230
Try to press it with your palm. It’s quite heavy still.

988
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,830
At this point I can’t cross your freedom.

989
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,830
So you have to say, “Mother, I want realization,

990
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,590
please give me realization."

991
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,870
You have to ask for it, otherwise I cannot force it into you.

992
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:17,550
Say it seven times please.

993
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,990
It's there. Still some Void.

994
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,390
Void and Agnya.

995
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:39,390
Now you raise the same hand for a while, on top of your head,

996
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,430
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

997
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,630
Just move it forward, backwards.

998
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,550
See if there’s a cool breeze coming out. Good? All right.

999
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,990
You can change over now. Don’t open your eyes, but change over.

1000
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,350
See from the other hand. Put the right hand towards Me,

1001
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,630
and put the left hand on top of your head,

1002
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,910
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

1003
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:27,470
First you will feel it on top of your head and then in your hands.

1004
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,910
You can always change your hand and see.

1005
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,990
Once this hand, once that hand.

1006
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:02,470
But don’t open your eyes. But put the other hand towards Me.

1007
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,310
It’s very cool.

1008
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,790
Now, if you have felt on your head

1009
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,990
just try to put your hands towards Me,

1010
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:57,390
and see that, if you are feeling it in your hands.

1011
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,630
Further, you are seeing at the back, now see it in front.

1012
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,670
Now in the hands you might feel it, just try in your hands.

1013
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:21,430
You may raise your hands high, up like this. You can open your eyes

1014
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:25,430
and raise your hands like this. And ask a question,

1015
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,390
that, “Is this the power of God?

1016
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:33,550
Is this the power of Holy Ghost?

1017
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:38,790
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Just ask the question.

1018
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,550
Are you feeling it? Something happening in the fingers,

1019
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:02,470
You’ll feel very relaxed, first of all. Extremely relaxed.

1020
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:08,230
All right? Now just see if it is happening.

1021
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,910
In your hands. Just see in your hands. Put them back.

1022
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:23,310
All right? Is there now? Not yet?

1023
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,070
How many of you are feeling the cool breeze in the head?

1024
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:30,230
Please raise your hands. It's good?

1025
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,630
And in the hands?

1026
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:38,790
Only in the hands. All right, it will work out.

1027
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,230
Now keep your eyes open.

1028
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:46,550
I’ll tell you another way, how you can raise your own Kundalini.

1029
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,470
You just watch Me and you do the same.

1030
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:50,910
You put your left hand,

1031
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,990
near towards your Kundalini like this, while sitting down.

1032
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,790
Let’s see. Now, sit little erect, all right?

1033
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:02,070
Now. And then, this right hand is to be used like this,

1034
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:04,590
you put the right hand across,

1035
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,310
front, below, back, up. Like that.

1036
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:14,630
You move the right hand like this.

1037
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:20,150
Just start moving it. Now bring it higher, over your head,

1038
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:26,230
put it high, and just turn it, give it a twist and tie it up.

1039
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:33,230
Try again please. Put this hand in front like this,

1040
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:37,150
with the right hand you start moving in this manner,

1041
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,870
which is a clockwise manner.

1042
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,790
Just start moving, move it properly, that’s very important.

1043
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,790
Keep one hand steadily moving.

1044
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:47,990
Now give it a twist again and one other knot.

1045
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:52,270
There are three powers, so for the third power we give three knots,

1046
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:57,070
not putting down our hands. Now let’s do again.

1047
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,870
Now put it up. Tie it up once, you don’t put down the hands.

1048
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:09,990
Again, give it a twist,

1049
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,990
knot, another one, nicely.

1050
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,470
Now see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

1051
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:33,910
Feeling?

1052
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,470
You can open your eyes.

1053
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,830
Now more people must be feeling cool breeze in their heads.

1054
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,830
It's so high as that, some people are feeling, yes, too.

1055
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:52,990
You can feel it higher, lower, anywhere. Just see.

1056
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,430
If you don’t feel it you have to say,

1057
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,950
“Please give me realisation Mother”, that’s all.

1058
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:06,030
You have to ask for it, that’s all, with your full heart.

1059
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:11,390
It’s there. All right? Good. Just ask for it.

1060
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:17,150
Just for the asking, because that’s your own right.

1061
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:22,150
All right? All the children have got it; beautifully.

1062
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:24,630
So may God bless you all.

1063
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:27,350
I’ll be here tomorrow again,

1064
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:31,790
and I’ll tell you about the imbalances we have, how we create them,

1065
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,390
how to get over them.

1066
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:38,830
In two lectures I hope I’ll be able to cover lot of things.

1067
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:42,470
But as you know, knowledge is like an ocean,

1068
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,790
and I don’t know how many lectures so far I have given,

1069
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:50,550
thousands, and so many are on the tape,

1070
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,310
and you can listen to them,

1071
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,990
about various dimensions of our Spirituality.

1072
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,830
What is the Spirit, how it manifests,

1073
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:03,470
what is the creation, everything is there.

1074
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,390
You can come to our ashram, which is a very beautiful place,

1075
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,150
and can listen to it, you can borrow from them

1076
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,710
and enjoy it for yourself.

1077
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:16,630
Tomorrow I hope to see you again, and day after,

1078
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,310
so I establish this realization with you.

1079
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:25,870
I would request you to bring some salt, sugar and water tomorrow,

1080
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:31,790
which I can vibrate for you, which will be a good thing to take.

1081
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:36,470
Just bring little bit not much is needed, just to vibrate.

1082
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:39,990
Thank you very much.

1083
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:51,790
I think tonight we’ll let Mother go home. She’s had a long day.

1084
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,030
And take the chance of meeting Her tomorrow night…

1085
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,350
I’ll meet everyone, individually, tomorrow,

1086
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,990
because today they fixed Me up with everything,

1087
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:05,110
television, radio, this, that. I was rushing everywhere, you see,

1088
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:09,550
and, I came in the morning by plane and you know what it is like.

1089
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,550
So if you could excuse Me today,

1090
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,230
tomorrow I'll be definitely here for a longer period,

1091
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,550
and I’ll meet all of you individually.

1092
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,390
And also if you have any questions,

1093
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:24,230
it’s better that you write them down in a paper and bring it here.

1094
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:25,550
Another thing I would suggest,

1095
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,310
that you must take the books, if you got the books.

1096
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,070
Yes.

1097
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,990
Books, but don’t read them tonight

1098
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:33,310
because again your head will be off.

1099
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,070
But you can take the photograph, and

1100
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:40,270
you can put your hands towards the photograph

1101
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:43,070
with a light before it. Because photograph has got vibrations.

1102
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,310
It has the same coefficient, it gives vibrations.

1103
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,190
Luckily, you see, very good.

1104
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,870
So if you put your left hand toward the photograph,

1105
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,990
first, with a light,

1106
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,630
you will start gradually feeling the cool breeze,

1107
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,230
right hand outside like that,

1108
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,710
you see like an outlet given.

1109
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:01,790
The whole thing that’s wrong there, passes out of this hand.

1110
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:04,110
Then you put your right hand towards the photograph,

1111
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:05,870
and the left hand outside.

1112
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:08,830
At this time, before sleeping if you do it,

1113
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:13,110
you can have a little basin of water,

1114
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,190
in which you can put some salt,

1115
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:19,630
and put your feet in it so the water sucks in problems within you.

1116
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,070
It’s very interesting to use all the five elements.

1117
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,950
We are using light,

1118
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:27,790
we can use the water, every sort of thing is to be used,

1119
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:29,910
just to give us proper balance.

1120
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:34,790
So, I hope you take the photograph and do the needful tonight.

1121
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,030
And don’t discuss about it, talk about it,

1122
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:40,110
because you cannot understand it with this limited brain.

1123
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,030
It’s an unlimited space where you have gone.

1124
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:46,790
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

1125
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:55,190
As you leave tonight, for those people who would like to follow it up

1126
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:58,910
we are very happy to let you know, where we meet each week,

1127
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,990
so that you could learn about Kundalini,

1128
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:05,670
about the chakras and develop your realization.

1129
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,910
So give to the person standing at the back

1130
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,350
your address and your telephone number.

1131
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,470
Why don’t you tell them address now? No harm.

1132
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:13,510
No, certainly.

1133
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:17,630
And the telephone number it's better if you write it down.

1134
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:20,630
Also give your name, but also...

1135
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:27,190
We have the ashram, the center is at 1267 Burke Road Kew.

1136
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:27,950
Again.

1137
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,870
1267 Burke Road Kew.

1138
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:34,310
Is it very easy to get to the road,

1139
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:37,430
there's two tram stop practically on the doorstep.

1140
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:39,630
However, that address is written

1141
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,630
or it's stamped on the bottom of a sheet

1142
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,070
that is enclosed in the little booklet that we have

1143
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:47,190
at the back of the hall. Our phone number also is there.

1144
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:51,950
It's 801696. You’re very welcome to come and see us.

1145
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:56,630
On Sunday as at the moment we’re planning to have a workshop,

1146
01:09:56,910 --> 01:10:00,150
where you are all welcome to come and spend time with Mother,

1147
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,430
and She will be able to talk to you more closely and

1148
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,230
show you in more practical ways how Sahaja Yoga,

1149
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,390
how this Kundalini awakening can work within you.

1150
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,990
When Mother said "bring salt sugar and water", it's to bring

1151
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:20,030
a small quantity of those particular substances because they can act

1152
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:24,910
upon our subtle body because they embody some of the essences

1153
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,830
that we have within ourselves. Just a small quantity

1154
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,470
in an opened packet, you know, so that it's easy, easy to reach, ok?

1155
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:33,550
Plastic bag or something.

1156
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:34,990
Take the addresses then.

1157
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:39,990
Oh, yes. And just for your own sake as much as anything,

1158
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:45,030
what often happens is, you know, it's quite hard to even comprehend

1159
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,510
what's gone on this evening, ok.

1160
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:52,790
You’ve come along, you've been given realization and you know

1161
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:56,430
it’s way beyond our own comprehension as to what's really happened

1162
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,070
and it's so easy to go away and think, "Oh, no, no.

1163
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:03,070
They were telling me stories. It couldn’t possibly be true."

1164
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:06,990
It is true, believe it. We can help you find that out,

1165
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:11,150
and establish it within yourself and just to help you,

1166
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,150
if you can give us your names and addresses.

1167
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:16,070
I’m certainly not forcing you to do it or anything like that

1168
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,830
but if you can do that, then we can keep in touch with you

1169
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,470
and help you establish it further.

1170
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:26,390
One instant God. I mean afterall, you must know that sometimes,

1171
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:29,550
it may take little time. Of course, it works instantly,

1172
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:32,190
but if something wrong inside then it takes time.

1173
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:34,990
So give more time to yourself, little patience with yourself,

1174
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,230
as I have patience with you.

1175
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,390
You must have some patience with yourself

1176
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,950
and just try to understand that this has to work out.

1177
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:44,630
That’s very important.

1178
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:48,430
If it has not worked out, it will have to be worked out.

1179
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:51,150
May God bless you.
