1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,190
now of course it is also true the second

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,970
point is that in sahaja yoga you have to

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,130
become you cannot just say that all

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,170
right I am become a sahaja yogi no you

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,900
cannot nor can you say I'm following

6
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,489
Shri Mataji that also cannot be said nor

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,559
you can say that all right we have an

8
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,540
organization or something like that or

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,520
I'm wearing this just because she's my

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,489
guru you can't say that I have to become

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,040
you have to become a sahaja yogi if you

12
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:49,019
have to become a sahaja yogi then it has

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,640
to be worked out and that takes time to

14
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:55,800
rise from near each other to miracle

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,870
might take style for some people it

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,330
takes more time for some people it takes

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,979
less time depends on the preparation of

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:07,140
a person also I would say previous lives

19
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,390
good deeds and this lives understanding

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,760
so many things are there so it takes

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:18,270
time but at least one can talk about it

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,539
so that mas fear is created you can talk

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,899
to people tell them that we have found

24
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:27,780
the truth and it's very simple you can't

25
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:30,840
pay for it it just works it's

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,240
spontaneous it's a living process it's

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,109
an evolutionary process you can talk

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,780
like that not about me but about sahaja

29
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,070
yoga in an abstract manner it's such a

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,780
wonderful thing one should do it all

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,590
such talks are going to help us a lot

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,979
though I would say those who listen to

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,200
you may not get realization but at least

34
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,420
in that posture it will be and that is

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,009
going to help us a lot if it is in the

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,429
atmosphere people know that there is

37
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,380
something like this coming up for you

38
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:07,399
people of course you have to work hard

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,600
and you have to become sahaja Yogi's

40
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:15,120
becoming is a little bit difficult to us

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,170
sometimes because there's this great

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,620
mystery ego

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,290
or maybe certain conditionings you see

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,190
that people can't give up and that they

45
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,190
find it difficult

46
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,099
get out but if you know how to raise

47
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,110
your Kundalini she will manage it she

48
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,959
knows how to do it and she will give you

49
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,739
that status but first and foremost thing

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,360
is to meditate and to raise your body

51
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,040
meditation is the only way you can grow

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,160
there's no other way out

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,349
because when you meditate you are in

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,280
silence you are in thoughtless awareness

55
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:56,420
then the growth of awareness takes place

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,250
then it opens up but if you are thinking

57
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,910
supposing there's a lake and the lake is

58
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:06,360
completely in a turmoil nothing can grow

59
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:08,370
but supposing it is silent then notices

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,420
can grow anything can grow in it in the

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:17,819
same way if your mind is agitated and

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:22,440
your growth is not yet fully expressing

63
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:25,500
itself then it's such a vicious circle

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,989
that you are agitated

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,720
and your growth is hindered again you

66
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,650
are agitated your growth isn't there so

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,220
the best way is to take to meditation

68
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,980
when you take to meditation this turmoil

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,310
will settle down and ready to settle

70
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,680
down

71
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,079
your growth will take place after

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,090
meditation will feel definitely that you

73
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,370
have come out very well you know grow

74
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,190
very well but for that one has to be

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,019
very honest you cannot force people to

76
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,030
be honest that's one thing you can't do

77
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,639
you have to be honest yourself you are

78
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,500
not to be hypocrite you have to see for

79
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,319
yourself that whatever you are doing is

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,319
for your benevolence it's for your good

81
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,560
and that you have to do it because it is

82
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,690
good for you to begin with and then for

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,370
the good of the humanity you are doing

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,320
for the good of the humanity

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,570
now some people who come for the first

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,970
time we will have lots of doubts because

87
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,910
of ego they have lots of doubts because

88
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,770
of ego how can that be how can this be

89
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,270
how I mean all kinds of things they ask

90
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,320
now you have to say that first of all

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,599
you develop your inside you develop your

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,849
enlightenment your light is not

93
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:39,720
sufficient in the light only there are

94
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,460
no doubt

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,400
supposing in darkness you think that

96
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,960
this table has no cover it's alright you

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,550
can think whatever you like but when

98
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,169
there's light you see for yourself there

99
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,699
is a beautiful cover on top of this

100
00:04:52,169 --> 00:05:00,569
table in the same way it happens to us

101
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:04,409
that we have to achieve a state and as

102
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,150
we achieve that state then there's no

103
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:09,180
question there's no doubt there's

104
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,330
nothing and you become so empowered it

105
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,120
is such a simultaneous thing it works as

106
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,569
soon as you achieve something it works

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,110
when it works then you are convinced

108
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:24,990
it's so I'd say it was a very beautiful

109
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:28,190
new chain starts within yourself

110
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:33,029
and then you really starts enjoying your

111
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:35,129
joy of yourself now it is for your gain

112
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,860
you have come to sahaja yoga not for

113
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:40,469
anybody else's gain first of all your

114
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,020
gain and once you gain something then

115
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:46,680
you can only help others to do something

116
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,050
about it so it is important to

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,479
understand the first rule of sahaja Yoga

118
00:05:49,050 --> 00:06:00,569
is that you look at yourself how are you

119
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:02,310
really progressing or you are worried

120
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,389
about other thing like your business

121
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,349
thing is that all you are worried about

122
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:13,259
your asset what are you worried about

123
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,729
are you worried about your ascent if you

124
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,669
are worried about your ascent what are

125
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:20,400
you doing about it that has to be the

126
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,819
main object of life the rest of the

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,000
things followed once you are saying the

128
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,729
whole cosmos can look after your

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,770
problems but you must ascend into the

130
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,560
kingdom of God that's the main point is

131
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:41,039
so first of all you have to ascertain

132
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:45,089
about yourself am i ascending am i

133
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,069
transforming am i giving up all my bad

134
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:49,039
habits

135
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:51,580
am i getting rid of my temper

136
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,880
am I getting peaceful

137
00:06:51,580 --> 00:07:01,390
am I now sweet or am I now still the

138
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:04,220
same horrible criticized er of others

139
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,320
just put your attention to yourself and

140
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,560
see for yourself it's like a mirror you

141
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,750
start seeing yourself in the mirror

142
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,930
what's wrong with you and then you try

143
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,290
to correct it now second point is that

144
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,200
you must see your vibrations what

145
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,700
centers you're catching yourself for

146
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,370
that you have to give yourself up on

147
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,530
that you give yourself abandon and see

148
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,450
for yourself what's wrong with you

149
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,880
when you give yourself up and then you

150
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,970
will know about your chakras and you'll

151
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,980
be amazed so that is how first pay

152
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,000
attention to yourself you find out

153
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,190
what's wrong with you

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,530
some of you might be having terrible -

155
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,780
ego then maybe you might be having a

156
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,640
very bad I'll getcha then you should

157
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,070
find out how we got wrong ketchup

158
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,810
this is equal then there's a very good

159
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,240
remedy in sahaja yoga which may look

160
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,220
ridiculous but it's very good remedy is

161
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,900
to beat yourself you choose as they know

162
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:04,400
it's the meeting with the shoes is

163
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:07,820
called as a shoe treatment now then you

164
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,060
have to go further see you find yourself

165
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,100
that your right side is hot what you do

166
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,280
is to put your right side towards the

167
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,690
photograph and left side up towards the

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,990
ether the ether takes away the heat but

169
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:26,780
what actually happens is that your right

170
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,470
side gets the vibration and the heat is

171
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:34,789
pushed towards your left and passes out

172
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:37,010
into theta now this heat comes from too

173
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,050
much futuristic living those people who

174
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,990
are too much futuristic they have too

175
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,600
much heat and too much heat has to go

176
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,710
away and when this heat starts going

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,150
away then you are amazed how it works

178
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,250
for that there are various things we

179
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,310
have to use but mainly for right-sided

180
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,160
people they should not use any light at

181
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,410
all they should not sit in the Sun they

182
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,990
should sit in the moon right they should

183
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,329
read some poetry they should not die

184
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,569
what

185
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:13,029
they should not look at time they should

186
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:15,579
allow the time to pass and they should

187
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,339
just become very sort of emotional

188
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,829
people they should sing songs of bhakti

189
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,600
they should not do hot yoga there's so

190
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:26,680
many things they should not do if their

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,000
right side you'd be surprised how people

192
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,339
have been helped through this kind of a

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,250
treatment which treats one side of your

194
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:40,649
being the left-hand side people are the

195
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:45,430
people as you know are the ones who are

196
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:50,290
those I who bear up lots of things from

197
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:55,839
others cry and weep and all the time on

198
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:58,600
the loser send such people have problems

199
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,000
also because all their organs are

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,829
lethargy and they have problems of a

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,959
guitar cheek heart the target liver

202
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:11,709
lethargic intestines everything becomes

203
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,889
very lethargic all these left-side

204
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,779
things can be cured plus they might have

205
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:19,000
some sort of a bother in them in the

206
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,709
sense they are possessed by someone of

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,050
course some of them are possessed by

208
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:25,000
right side also not that only the left

209
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,630
side is possessed but from the right

210
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,930
side also they're possessed and left

211
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,699
sided positions are of a peculiar type

212
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,910
because they give you pain in the body

213
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:39,399
you get pains in the body right-sided

214
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,319
person doesn't get any pain himself he

215
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,380
gives pain to others he's very sarcastic

216
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:47,380
he's very aggressive he troubles others

217
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,209
but the left-sided people have pains

218
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,620
themselves they get being here and a

219
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,750
pain there and pain here

220
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,060
so left side is to be cleared as you

221
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,040
know very well through the light light

222
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,569
is put before the photograph left hand

223
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,579
towards the photograph right hand on the

224
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:05,470
mother earth so the left hand gets the

225
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,920
light and the light passes through and

226
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,880
the negativity of the left side passes

227
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,309
through the right hand and the right

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,520
hand is on the mother earth the mother

229
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:18,460
earth is the one who sucks in all the

230
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,200
negative forces of the left-hand side so

231
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,970
these are the two sides which we clear

232
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,590
but once you have cleared these two

233
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,720
sides then you can use the photograph

234
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,180
sit with your both the hands towards the

235
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,170
photograph and put both the feet in the

236
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,650
water a little bit of salt in it and

237
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:37,870
about five ten minutes you must allow

238
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,350
vibrations to clear you out then wipe

239
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:43,750
your feet put the water properly into

240
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,730
some disposal and then sit down for

241
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:51,390
meditation if you can do that every day

242
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,940
even ten minutes is more than sufficient

243
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,430
don't have to do anything in an extreme

244
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,230
manner in the morning time you have to

245
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,780
give yourself abundant when you are

246
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,920
going out don't go out without giving a

247
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,430
button and attention should be all the

248
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,860
time

249
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,870
inside in the sense that walking on the

250
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,300
road people have habit of seeing these

251
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,640
in that sing like that the attention

252
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,740
gets returned away what you should do is

253
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,380
to see about three feet or 4 feet at the

254
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,060
most on the ground and not about because

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,420
you can see are the beautiful children

256
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:28,600
flowers everything there's nothing very

257
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:31,360
beautiful about that so better is to see

258
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,400
only up three four feet if possible to

259
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,670
fix your attention so the attention

260
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,700
becomes concentrated and you feel very

261
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,490
relaxed and relieved of too much of

262
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,880
wobbling of your eyes eyes are very

263
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,290
important very important and as you will

264
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,350
notice because you are all realized

265
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,960
souls that your eyes now have got a

266
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,540
gaint a kind of a light in the eye and

267
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,660
that light shows that you are a light

268
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,230
source so best thing is that you should

269
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,230
try to

270
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:15,079
you should try to put your attention

271
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,449
within yourself to see for yourself how

272
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:21,139
far you have grown through your

273
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:24,230
vibrations know yourself what is

274
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:28,549
required in you first and foremost thing

275
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:32,749
the light has to be clean then see how

276
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:36,589
far you can reach your mind how far you

277
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:40,790
can increase your dimension how far you

278
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:45,170
can go with others I hope this little

279
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:49,670
small little explanation about your

280
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:52,610
meditation and your method of rising and

281
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,589
ascending will help you to grow further

282
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,290
but I don't mind if you have any

283
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,309
questions I would like to answer them

284
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:02,529
may God bless you

285
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,529
may God bless you may God bless

286
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:41,740
see you must raise your Kundalini try to

287
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:45,279
raise it put your attention to your

288
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,290
sister say mother come in my head as

289
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,839
soon as kundalini crosses da guia you

290
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:56,019
cannot have those thoughts you should

291
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,269
allow this simple method also that if

292
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,870
you see any thought coming in you should

293
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:06,449
say I forgive I forgive is a very big

294
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,449
mantra see that taught me strong

295
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:17,910
what happens what happens it has an

296
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:19,350
effect all right it has anything but

297
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,110
after that I think you all should go

298
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,700
into meditation for a while after

299
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,300
listening to my lecture you just going

300
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,100
to my meditation actually my lectures

301
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,460
are not to be understood by your brains

302
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,590
but through your Kundalini and through

303
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,810
your heart so it's doesn't matter if you

304
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,400
