1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Today again is

2
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,870
a new year's day. Every new year comes, because 
we have to take to something that is new.

3
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,300
It has been so arranged that the sun has to 
move for 365 days and again a new year has

4
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:22,789
come. 
Actually the whole Solar System is moving

5
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,180
in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a 
higher, higher state of this Solar System.

6
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:41,719
Every year it is rising higher in a spiral 
way. So it is not only that it is because

7
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:50,889
365 days have passed, it is because it has 
moved a step forward, higher than what it

8
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:59,960
was. 
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings

9
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,960
have definitely risen much higher than what 
they were, say, about 2000 years back. But,

10
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,300
the first system that started the whole Universe 
was the first model, you can say was created.

11
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,669
And that model has to be perfect. And that 
was a perfect model which then started perfecting

12
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,439
the rest of it. 
So that is the perfect model which is in the

13
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:39,439
principle of this ascent. And that is working 
out this ascent. Now, the perfection of the

14
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,669
rest of the universe takes place in various 
directions.

15
00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:00,669
But today we have to consider the Mahalakshmi 
Principle. The Mahalakshmi, as I told you,

16
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,599
is a perfect principle. It's a perfect principle. 
It's perfected. It is born as perfect, will

17
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,710
remain as perfect, will be always eternally 
perfect so that it is not necessary to be

18
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,240
corrected. 
Now this Mahalakshmi's thing I am discussing

19
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,240
here because you may be able to go today to 
see the temple of Mahalakshmi. Now the temple

20
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:40,950
of Mahalakshmi when you go there, you have 
to know that this deity has come out of the

21
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:48,089
Mother Earth in this particular place. That 
means this place has got a capacity to give

22
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,720
you a force. You can say, an additional force 
or an intensive feeling of evolution. If you

23
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,520
are sensitive enough you can see that, you 
can feel it and you can do it. But, if you

24
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,290
are not so sensitive, you are still so conditioned 
and still outside, that may not work out.

25
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:22,290
I mean all kinds of things can be done, but 
if somebody wants to remain a stone you can't

26
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,649
do anything about it. 
So this Mahalakshmi principle is working out

27
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,649
in this place Kolhapur. Normally, this place 
should be very, very warm because of its position.

28
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,890
But even in summer this place keeps very cool 
because of the vibrations from the temple

29
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:51,050
that is emitted. The people in this place 
may not be so aware either. We cannot say

30
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,940
if they are aware because, as negativity has 
to come forward, there are lots of sugar factories

31
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,940
and lots of alcoholism going on here. 
But we have to take the best advantage of

32
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,880
every place which is created specially for 
a particular purpose. So, it is a pilgrimage,

33
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,880
in a way, that we are here. That we have to 
look after our Mahalakshmi Principle of our

34
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:32,370
ascent. As you know, this ascent starts at 
the Nabhi and is surrounded by the Guru principle.

35
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:44,650
Now the Guru Principle within us, if it is 
absurd, if it is juxtapositioned, placed in

36
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:52,280
juxtaposition where, if it is not properly 
embedded within us, if it is not emitting

37
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,620
through our character and behaviour, Mahalakshmi 
tattwa cannot be strengthened.

38
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Mahalakshmi tattwa is strengthened through 
Guru principle. Now we are lucky today because

39
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,000
there was the birthday of Datta, Dattatreya, 
just the other day, when we had the puja,

40
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,340
and today is this Mahalakshmi puja. So two 
things together we have got together. First

41
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,960
was the Datta puja and today is this puja 
of Mahalakshmi. So, to have the Guru principle

42
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,010
all right, we must make our dharmas correct. 
Now these dharmas, as I have told you many

43
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:39,010
times, are ten, and we should look after these 
ten dharmas in a very careful manner. These

44
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,830
are expressed outside, but whatever is inside 
comes out.

45
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,840
Now I find, when you people talk, and you 
say things, I know that this person is negative,

46
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,440
that person is definitely positive. There 
are so many ways of expression of positivity.

47
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,030
But how I know that, I cannot tell you, because 
I just don't know how to tell you that. But

48
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:09,140
I just know that such a person is definitely 
positive and such a person is negative. The

49
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:16,140
positivity lies in understanding why are we 
here. First of all, why are we on this earth?

50
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,810
Why are we human beings? In understanding! 
What are we doing about it? Why are we Sahaja

51
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yogis? What a Sahaja Yogi has to do? What 
is his responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi. Then

52
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:46,090
he moves forward to understand -- why Mother 
is so kind to me? Why have I got vibrations?

53
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,120
Why am I among very few who have got this 
special blessing, the special knowledge of

54
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,120
vibratory awareness. And then to ask yourself, 
"What am I doing about it? Am I still very

55
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,550
much embedded in my cheapishness or in my 
childishness, in my stupidity, in my harshness,

56
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,150
in my aggressiveness?" 
We always see these things in other people,

57
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,100
not in ourselves -- so we are not Sahaja Yogis. 
We should understand at that point. When we

58
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,310
start seeing these things in other people, 
then we are not Sahaja Yogis. We should see

59
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:37,310
in ourselves and emit pure compassion to others. 
But always people see that it is in another

60
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,520
person this exists. Whatever I may try to 
say they always see in other person. Now supposing

61
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,360
there's a negative person among us, you need 
not be compassionate to that person. On the

62
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,200
contrary better be away. Get rid of that person, 
as far as possible don't have anything to

63
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,150
do [with them]. Is a definite sign of great 
compassion to yourself, if not to others.

64
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,310
Better not have anything to do with the person 
who is negative, if you have to come up. He

65
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:17,310
may be your brother, sister, anyone. But try 
to be away from a person who is not positive.

66
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,500
It causes lots of problems. I have been telling 
you this, and I have been requesting you,

67
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,160
but the conditioning is such that, still though 
you have become a Guru tattwa, you don't understand

68
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,340
that you have to be detached. 
For the Guru there's no brother, sister or

69
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,190
any other relationship except for the relationship 
of the Mother. There is no other relationship.

70
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:47,020
One of these principles are to be understood. 
Very important I feel is for all of you that

71
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,760
-- our relationship is only to Mother and 
to Sahaja Yogis and not to any relationship

72
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,600
which has come to us, whether through Sahaja 
Yoga or whether through anything else. Now

73
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,600
this I have been explaining because our Mahalakshmi 
Tattwa is not all right. That's why we get,

74
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,240
sort of, frittered away, lost, into these 
things. And the Mahalakshmi tattwa has to

75
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,360
be like an ascending force all put together. 
Like my father used to give an example. That

76
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:33,390
supposing you have collected lot of wheat 
and you spread it on the ground, it will be

77
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,700
all lost. It will be spread out like this, 
this side, that side, it will be all lost.

78
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,880
But if you put it in a bag, it will rise in 
height. Naturally! It will have those maryadas.

79
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,890
It will rise and it will go higher and higher. 
In the same way this principle of Mahalakshmi

80
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:58,890
can spread just across like that, and can 
just destroy all that Mother has given us

81
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:08,170
and all that we have had all these years, 
only by spreading it out.

82
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,240
Now to collect it inside, is to pay attention 
to yourself. First of all, try to clarify

83
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,240
your ideas and your understanding in [the] 
brain. Is important, because Mahalakshmi tattwa

84
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:27,610
ultimately works in the brain. Is the enlightenment 
of the brain, is done by Mahalakshmi tattwa.

85
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,220
It gives you the Sat, the Truth, you see. 
So in the brain you must clarify. Reach logically.

86
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Logically you must reach the conclusion, "I 
don't have to do these things, I have to do

87
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:50,740
these things. I have to ascend. This is why 
I am here. Why I am here? What am I supposed

88
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:59,910
to do?" Now logically you convince your brain, 
first of all. This is very important now,

89
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:05,569
after realisation. Because if logically your 
brain doesn't understand, it will always be

90
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:12,569
cheapish, childish, indignified or could be 
harsh, horribly oppressive. It could be one

91
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,919
of these. 
So, in Guru tattwa, there are ten elements.

92
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,919
Five of them deal with the weight. Weight. 
Guru is the weight you see. Weight of a person.

93
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,820
How much weight you have got? The gravity, 
as we call it. Person has a gravity. When

94
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,299
he talks how much balance he has got. See 
in Indian Music, we call it Vazan, means the

95
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:45,299
weight. The weight of the person, means when 
he is dealing with himself or with others,

96
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,010
how much weight he carried. In English also 
they use this -- weight. How much weight he

97
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,299
carries with others? Means, how much he can 
really impress others? If you impress too

98
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:01,919
much, all right, then the person will say, 
'Oh, it's too much.' That is the very big

99
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,720
quality with western people is, "Oh, that 
is too much!" That's because they have an

100
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,890
idea, you see. This is all ego oriented. That 
is too much. If you tell them too much, "Oh!

101
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,520
that is too much. She is too much. I do it 
slowly, slowly. It is too much for me!" Is

102
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,549
very common, is very common reaction. So how 
much weight you have.

103
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:30,549
And the second one is the quality of magnetic. 
Two things. Magnetism. First is the quality

104
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,080
of weight. That's how much dignified you are. 
How you talk. How your language is. How your

105
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,559
behaviour is. You should be humorous, but 
sometimes, even with me, I find people talk

106
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:56,669
in a very funny manner. I just don't understand, 
how is it that always they say the wrong things?

107
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,580
I mean, even if they have to say one sentence, 
they'll say a wrong thing. Is absolutely with

108
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,769
them. It is also Vishuddhi, which is also 
Nabhi, comes from Nabhi, because you must

109
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,669
know that Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of 
the Nabhi Chakra.

110
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:15,850
So what happens, that a person whatever he 
is, is expressed through his language, through

111
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:20,169
his behaviour, through his face, through his 
nose, his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi

112
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,940
Chakra. So the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed, 
shown, through the Vishuddhi Chakra. Now whatever

113
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,940
you have in the Nabhi is shown here. Supposing 
now, a person who has the Mahalakshmi tattwa

114
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,190
properly developed, such a person will have 
a way of dealing with another person where

115
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:43,190
he will have the weight as well as the understanding 
[of] how far to go with the person. How far

116
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:55,860
to carry on with the person. How far to talk 
to a person. How far to think about it. How

117
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,919
much importance to be given. That's one point, 
is very important.

118
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:07,340
And the another point is that -- how much 
magnetism you have? So you reverse back to

119
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,340
yourself. The magnetism is a magic, is a magic 
of a person. A person is magnetic because

120
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:22,009
he has certain magic. Now this magic is, comes, 
from your own personality. From your own personality.

121
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:30,909
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand side, 
starts. And that basis is Shri Ganesha. Shri

122
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:38,210
Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism. So 
you're innocent. Innocence is the best way

123
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:45,129
to have that magnetism. Magnetism you cannot 
express in material way. It's not a material

124
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:52,129
stuff but it is something abstract, comes 
from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

125
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:59,759
Such a person is magnetic. Magnetic means 
that such a person attracts other person because

126
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,759
of the weight of the person, because of the 
quality of the person such a person attracts.

127
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:14,230
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical 
things. But attracts another person because

128
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:21,960
of the fragrance of love in the subjects. 
Now it is always confused. Confused!. Because

129
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,960
it's such an abstract thing so one must understand 
it in a very subtle way. What is this magnetism?

130
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,360
That one should understand. You see, there 
some gestures people use artificially. Which

131
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,019
normally they have been using just to attract 
other people, the way they walk, the way they

132
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:42,529
dress, the way they live. All these things 
are of no use. It is something so inner, that

133
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:49,369
fragrance is so inner which must be developed. 
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people just

134
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,830
don't bother about it, just don't bother. 
They think the way they have been living,

135
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,059
the way they have been this...say, if they 
are English, they are English, if they are

136
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,100
French they are French, if they are Indians 
they are Indians, if they are from Kolhapur

137
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,100
they will be from Kolhapur. These ideas first 
must be curbed off, because the fragrance

138
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,989
spreads everywhere whether you are English 
or anyone.

139
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:17,600
So the fragrance of a person develops through, 
first of all, the Ganesha principle within

140
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,600
you. Ganesha principle is to be first of all 
seen to. Now a Ganesha person is not a person

141
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,960
who is absolutely a remorse type or a person 
who is such a gone case that even if you beat

142
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:42,059
him up and make him into a complete minced 
thing, he will bear it. It's not like that!

143
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,470
It's not that. On the contrary the quality 
of magnetism is such that it attracts you,

144
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:57,610
to a point where you are not disturbed. Now 
this is a very important point we should know.

145
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:05,340
You see, if you have other loves, love like 
carnal love and all other love you have, then

146
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,090
that love you may attract the person. That 
person can destroy you and it destroys you,

147
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:17,090
always. But this attraction does not destroy, 
does not destroy. The attraction is up to

148
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:24,980
that point that you are not destroyed, because 
you being much higher, much deeper and much

149
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,100
weightier, you cannot be destroyed by a thing 
that you are attracting. Always the greater

150
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,100
magnet attracts the smaller magnet. And that 
is what one should understand. This magic

151
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:46,950
and this karishma, the charismatic temperament 
of a person comes by, first of all, the Ganesh

152
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,519
tattwa, innocence. And secondly by complete 
dedication and devotion.

153
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:00,519
Those who are completely dedicated and devoted 
to Mother. Not to anything else. Ganesh tattwa

154
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,070
again. Not to your wife, not to your husband, 
not to your sister, not to your country, not

155
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:17,070
to anyone but to Mother. Complete dedication 
gives you that charisma, or that attraction.

156
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,659
In Sahaja Yoga such a person becomes really 
attractive and such a person has ??????.

157
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:36,659
Now some

158
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:48,769
people think that if you are a very passive 
person and if anybody says anything to you

159
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:58,779
and you don't mind, sort of a person you are 
charismatic. It is not. People like you because

160
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:06,989
they can dominate you. They like you because 
they can dominate you. Now if you think that

161
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:13,029
by your aggressiveness and by your shouting 
and by your screaming at these people, you

162
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:20,029
will achieve that charismatic temperament, 
you cannot. You cannot achieve that height.

163
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:28,850
So how do you achieve it? By becoming more 
innocent.

164
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:35,850
Now how innocence develops in a person is 
by not thinking about it. Like, you see, somebody

165
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:43,070
asked me, 'How do you manage your Income Tax?' 
I said, 'By having no income at all'. Then

166
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,720
they asked me, 'How do you solve your car 
problem?' "By not having any car at all of

167
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,330
mine." They said, 'What about your house problem?" 
"By having no house of my own."

168
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,639
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me. Then 
how do you solve your this problem? By not

169
00:25:54,639 --> 00:26:01,639
having it, just have -- "No, not have it!" 
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

170
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:09,470
See when you take up headaches upon yourself 
then only the innocence is reduced. That headaches

171
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:16,470
like this, that "This is my shawl, this is 
my sari, this is my thing, this is this, this

172
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:23,909
is this, this is this". But only one thing 
is that "This is my Mother and I have to proclaim

173
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,690
Her", that's all. 
If that is the way it is, then innocence starts

174
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:39,950
rising like Shri Ganesha, and by having no 
other headache. "This is mine, that is mine."

175
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,429
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I 
think. Personally, I think this must be the

176
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:52,009
reason. That this 'mine' business. 'This is 
mine.' Because whatever is mine. Somebody

177
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:57,869
told me, this is very good argument he gave, 
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is

178
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:04,559
not Sahaja. My body, my head, my everything 
-- 'my'. But 'I' He gave me this idea -- 'I'.

179
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,559
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separating, Whatever 
is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your

180
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,450
Spirit. Somebody gave me this argument. I 
said "Is a very good argument to work it out".

181
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:23,450
Then whatever remains is the 'I' and that 
'I' is the one we have to see! So you go on

182
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,419
reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'. 
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

183
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:38,419
So the idea about Spirit also, people think 
that if you become spiritual -- I mean, I

184
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,100
don't know what people think about spiritual 
people. But the idea about spiritual people

185
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,659
is that you have to be something terrific 
like a bull or I don't know. You have to be

186
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:57,659
sharp like a fox or you have to be intellectual 
like Freud or something. All sorts of ideas

187
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:08,419
people have. No, it is not! Spiritual person 
is just innocent, just innocent. There is

188
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,359
no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent. The 
whole thing is innocence. See, whatever he

189
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:21,659
talks or says, comes through innocence. It 
doesn't have intellect as such, which here

190
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,249
people have through reading and through understanding 
and by analysing. Nothing of the kind. It

191
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:32,249
just has pure and simple innocence. And it 
all works out very well. It is so clean. It

192
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:43,279
just says what it knows and what it knows 
is the highest.

193
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:52,379
So this deconditioning has to be brought within 
us. But you should not discuss it among yourselves

194
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,879
also. Once you start discussing then you also, 
you see, it becomes sort of a theological

195
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:04,879
argumentation. There is no theology about 
it. It's very simple. It's the simplest thing

196
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:13,009
is to be innocent. But the innocence is lost. 
Why? Because our attention is in different

197
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:20,299
way, we are attentive to other things. We 
are looking at other things. It's so simple,

198
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:24,970
you know. Today I was thinking I have to buy 
three nine-yard saris. A simple question as

199
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,409
it is, because there were three ladies who 
wear nine yard saris and I had to give them

200
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:33,289
three nine yard saris. That is all. I just 
thought of it. All right. I came here, I saw

201
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,850
very nice saris being put here. So I asked 
her, 'Where do you get?' She said 'You get

202
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,570
it here'. I said 'All right'. So you go and 
buy these three saris. No analysis, nothing

203
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:48,570
of the kind. It just came into my mind that 
I have to buy three saris, finished! The answer

204
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,940
is here. So even the atmosphere is so innocent, 
the whole situation is so innocent that the

205
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,369
solution is presented by innocence to innocence. 
Innocence works out in everything, you see,

206
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:03,559
because everybody has little bit of innocence 
in every one, isn't it? So you can...it's

207
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:10,559
like a fifth column, you see. The innocence 
is a fifth column within you. So if any person

208
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,889
is innocent, you see he'll work on your fifth 
column and will make you all right. When you

209
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:24,889
give bandhan to others, what happens, you 
actually bind him by your innocence and the

210
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:32,529
poor fellow doesn't know. He has his innocence 
within him, you capture that innocence, that

211
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,970
is all you have done, that's how you manage. 
It's very simple to work out things. Only

212
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,970
principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests 
on what? Tattwa is nothing but innocence.

213
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:51,259
So try to develop this by all these things... 
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus" By

214
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:56,379
saying "Not this, not this, not this, not 
this, not this," to all your thoughts. "Not

215
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:03,379
this not this, not this, not this". You reach 
there. 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not

216
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:13,210
mine". And that is how it is. 
And you see the whole material world is now

217
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:20,210
attacking the innocence, because they are 
frightened. You cannot attack it. Innocence

218
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:27,229
cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed. 
Innocence is something [which] is all pervading

219
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:31,590
and it cannot be destroyed. So whatever people 
may try, it cannot be destroyed. But it can

220
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:38,590
be covered, it can recede, but it cannot be 
destroyed. It will act it's own way. So try

221
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:48,470
to develop that innocence which is the basis 
of Mahalakshmi Tattwa, we should say, or that

222
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:55,179
is essence of Mahalakshmi tattva. 
So the outward things, the weightage, the

223
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,519
weight, the dignity, the behaviour everything. 
It is outward thing and the inside thing -- the

224
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,960
tattwa, the principle, on which it is based 
is innocence.

225
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,619
Now if, with this, if we understand Mahalakshmi 
tattwa within us, how it has to work out.

226
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:16,609
It's not intellectual! Again I would say that 
I don't want you to project your intellect

227
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:22,330
into it, and to find out, but just remain 
where you are and you will find the answers

228
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:28,940
just coming to you..automatically! 
Just don't project your minds into it. Just

229
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,519
you'll get answers to every question, just 
like that. Because innocence in everyone is

230
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,529
the simple answer where all the complications 
drop out. The innocence is that. And that

231
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:47,349
is what is the love of God, is the love of 
God.

232
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:53,269
So don't confuse this with love, with all 
your nonsensical love ideas you have about

233
00:32:53,269 --> 00:33:00,269
people and identification, misidentification. 
This is pure love within us, the purity, the

234
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,299
innocence which is love and which is life 
itself, we should say. It is a part of that,

235
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:13,109
the Prana Shakti. But Prana Shakti is not 
Mahalakshmi.

236
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:20,109
So Mahalakshmi is the essence and essence 
of everything, Because if creation has to

237
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,769
take place, also, if desire of God is there, 
and if there is no Mahalakshmi tattwa, then

238
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:33,159
what is the use of having desire? 
Supposing, even if you have creation, and

239
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,789
you do not have the Mahalakshmi tattwa, how 
will you work it out? You cannot work it out,

240
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,929
You have to have Mahalakshmi tattwa. Because 
they do not have any meaning.

241
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:48,840
So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but 
inside, inside is, we can say, there are three

242
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,529
cores. The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa, 
outside to look at, you see the growth, all

243
00:33:53,529 --> 00:34:00,529
right. Then inside is the creation, that is 
all the elements being created and all that.

244
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,919
But inside that is the desire and inside the 
desire is the half one, you can say, is the

245
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:19,869
Ganesha. So this Ganesh tattwa ultimately 
overpowers everything and permeates everything.

246
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:28,159
And this is, I would say that, don't think 
about it. Just allow your innocence to grow,

247
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,290
Simple innocence. 
And your dignity. That's very important to

248
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:44,290
have your dignity. Like some people think 
if they wear torn clothes and walk about on

249
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:49,470
the street, and all they are big sanyasis. 
It's wrong. Why? You are not being dignified

250
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,609
and God has given you so much, why should 
you try to show that you haven't got anything?

251
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:00,450
Just to show off that you haven't got anything 
God has given. This is just a sort of thanks-giving

252
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:07,160
to God that, "God you have given me so much." 
You have to wear the best. Like in Puja, if

253
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:13,170
you see, the ladies here wear all their nose 
rings and all their ornaments and everything,

254
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,830
in the temple if they have to go. Everything 
they wear! And in the same way, men also wear

255
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,160
their very clean dresses, very clean things, 
whatever they have, they wear simple, clean

256
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,160
dresses, whatever they have. But no ostentation. 
It is just a thing by which you express. The

257
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:36,940
God has given you this. 'O God! I thank you'. 
It is such a great day today to be, in the

258
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:45,400
new year, on the new year day, to be here 
on Mahalakshmi's place of Kolhapur. And this

259
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,400
is also called Kolhapur because Kolhasura 
was killed here. Kolhasura was a horrible

260
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:02,060
fellow like a fox and he was born again. Now 
he is again dead. Thank God!

261
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,550
He was here and now he's...Kolhasura died. 
You don't think about it, again your mind

262
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,970
goes out. Don't think about it, I will tell 
you about it. I have deliberately avoided

263
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:17,380
the name. He was born again and was pitched 
out. So this is the place where Kolhasura

264
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,380
was killed, where this was established, so 
Mahalakshmi incarnation came in and that is

265
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,460
how this place has a special value, that we 
have come here for a pilgrimage and let us

266
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:37,460
be in a humble way. Think about it. 
Actually these things could not take place

267
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,830
in the West because even if they had come 
out of the Mother Earth who would have recognised

268
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:48,110
them? Who would have known about them? Who 
would have respected them? Who would have

269
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:55,110
worshipped them? That is why it did not happen 
in the West too much. But it is there, little

270
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,780
bit is there, no doubt. But here now we have 
these, all these, temples and the attack on

271
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:14,780
the innocence has come from tantrikas. And 
so the tantrikas entered all these temples

272
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:21,380
and they tried to establish themselves. But 
gradually they are being neutralised and cleaned

273
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,290
out. These tantrikas have gone into every 
temple of all the Goddesses. And they will

274
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:32,140
be gradually all out, straight out. 
So this is the attack that came through and

275
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:39,140
that how these brahmins came down and settled 
in these places. So-called brahmins. And tried

276
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:46,740
to preach about all tantrik methods and things 
here, in the temple, and they really spoiled

277
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,050
the atmosphere here. 
So may God bless you all.

278
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:02,050
I want you people to develop concentration 
of mind so that you rise above all other misidentifications

279
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:17,550
and get identified with the Pure Spirit, through 
your Mahalakshmi principle.

280
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,150
May God bless you.
