1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:06,507
Happy Christmas to you all.
May God Bless You.

2
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:34,228
The birth of Christ is celebrated all over
the world,

3
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:42,934
and it’s nice that we are celebrating here
at Ganapatipule His birth.

4
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:47,749
As you know very well in Sahaja Yoga,
we have realised

5
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,984
that the principle of Christ was
Shri Ganesha.

6
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:54,943
So this is the right place to celebrate
the Christmas

7
00:00:55,144 --> 00:01:02,541
and the Birth of Christ is the - absolutely
coincides today

8
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:07,985
and I am very happy that you have chosen
Ganapatipule for that.

9
00:01:08,186 --> 00:01:15,900
Now as you know very well, that Ganesha’s
principle became

10
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,886
the principle of Christ at the Agnya
Chakra.

11
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:26,032
And that’s a very important centre that
we have within ourselves

12
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:34,985
which has given us a new dimension
to our personality,

13
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:41,992
that we can resurrect ourselves as Christ
resurrected Himself;

14
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:47,443
so the message of His life is resurrection.

15
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:55,817
So from His birth He got His resurrection
done, in the same way

16
00:01:56,018 --> 00:02:04,120
you are born again when you get your
Resurrection, or you become Sahaja Yogis.

17
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:08,567
On the same principle it works.

18
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:16,063
But He had to physically pass through
all the penance,

19
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:20,865
as we say that He died for us, for our
sins;

20
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:28,244
but now as He has done that for us,
the Agnya Chakra is absolutely

21
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:33,007
at our command, that we can open it out
whenever we like,

22
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:40,084
if we are Sahaja Yogis, and we can
enlighten that Chakra also.

23
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:44,187
This is the Chakra always caught up
by people

24
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:50,787
who try talk about Christ, to say things
about Christ,

25
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:55,905
or to profess that they have Christ
in their pockets,

26
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:58,963
when they have no connection with Christ.

27
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,673
Now, for this Christ has very clearly said,

28
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:06,090
that, “You will be calling me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognise you”.

29
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,721
There are so many people of this kind,
and that’s why

30
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:16,017
the celebration of Christ’s Birth by them
is just a festival

31
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,803
but has no deeper significance.
But for Sahaja Yogis

32
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:26,586
it’s a very great happening, because
His birth

33
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:29,790
has brought such a great Incarnation
on this earth

34
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:38,887
and by that we could achieve our
Realisation because He is at the gate.

35
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:46,713
So, today is the day of thankfulness
for Christ’s Advent on this earth,

36
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:53,159
and we have to see that as He is our
eldest brother,

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,592
we can say, He is our leader, we have
to follow His footsteps;

38
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:05,395
in our Resurrection, we have to show
that we have imbibed

39
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:11,472
the qualities which are Christ-like,

40
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:18,873
illuminating the whole Universe with
our enlightened lives.

41
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:23,477
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis
to understand that

42
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:29,113
when we are celebrating today the birth
of Christ, we stand for something

43
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:38,214
very much beautiful, pure and glorious.

44
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:45,834
Christ’s life is a - symbolically can be
called

45
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:57,223
as the symbol of purity and holiness,
He was purity and holiness.

46
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:04,127
When we talk of purity we may think
about outside purity,

47
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:09,285
or maybe the purity of our writings
or talking,

48
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:14,797
or maybe we are very sophisticated, or we
talk very sweetly, or we are very kind;

49
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:26,587
but Christ was pure in the sense that
He was nothing but purity.

50
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:33,503
And He went to this extent of purity,
that He said that,

51
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:40,372
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,
that your eyes have to be pure.

52
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:46,688
Even up to the eyes. He said: “Thou
shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

53
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:53,327
So, the lust and greed has to disappear
from our personality

54
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:57,397
if we have to follow Christ, if we have
to understand

55
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:00,957
what an incarnation of holiness He was.

56
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:05,662
Holiness is very important today, when
in this ghor Kali Yuga

57
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:10,134
you find all kinds of horrible things
happening.

58
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:15,839
If you believe in holiness, in your
chastity and in your purity,

59
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,123
then your morality is within yourself,
is not outside.

60
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,706
Whatever people may say about Christ today,

61
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:31,387
but you know as Sahaja Yogis that He was
purest of pure.

62
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:37,618
In the same way, we should try to keep
our purity above everything else.

63
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,517
The most important thing for us to be
pure people:

64
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:47,553
pure from heart, pure in our morality,
pure in our thinking

65
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:52,511
and pure in our rapport that we have
with others.

66
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,829
Not just a show, not just artificiality,

67
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,674
but from within we should feel that
oneness,

68
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:04,476
that understanding that we are all
Sahaja Yogis,

69
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:08,671
born of a Mother, and we all have to love
each other.

70
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:12,163
That is the greatest blessings you could
give to Me

71
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:16,775
and also the greatest joy for Christ,
to see that all of you

72
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:23,647
are absolutely in unison and in complete
accord with each other.

73
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:29,367
This is something one has to understand,
that He also said to His disciples that,

74
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:35,064
“The greatest pleasure for me is to see
you all together in one unison.”

75
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:39,831
But now the collective consciousness is
within your consciousness,

76
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:42,532
you can feel the collectivity within
yourself;

77
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:46,793
so it should be very easy for you to become
one with each other,

78
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:53,202
to understand each other, just like a part
and parcel of one being.

79
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:58,040
So I wish you all A Very Happy Christmas
and let us start this New year

80
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:03,683
with the full idea that we have to have
that dedication of Christ,

81
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:08,250
that understanding of Christ, how He
dedicated His life,

82
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:15,305
which was very short, for the establishment
of purity in this world.

83
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:19,200
If the Sahaja Yogis do not have that
personality,

84
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,566
they cannot establish Sahaja Yoga anywhere.

85
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:26,167
So the first and foremost thing we have
to aspire is purity,

86
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,365
as you know very well that Adi Shakti first
created Shri Ganesha

87
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,396
who is the symbol of purity.

88
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,870
So today we have to take a vow, that
henceforth

89
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:43,510
we are going to follow a life of complete
purity and detachment.

90
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:47,014
That’s not so difficult if you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

91
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:52,399
If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy
to purify yourself.

92
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,842
I am so very happy you all could come here.

93
00:08:55,043 --> 00:09:01,822
Lots of inconveniences are there, but
as you being the saints now,

94
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:06,970
don’t complain anything and you are
enjoying whatever is there,

95
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:14,591
the pure air of this place and the purity
of nature that is around us.

96
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:23,569
Let us also meditate and emit, manifest

97
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,831
that beautiful thing that is within us
which is the Spirit.

98
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:32,965
And I am sure all this place will be
vibrant very soon,

99
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:37,957
as it is I could feel the vibrations from
a very long distance when I came.

100
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:40,515
May God bless you all.
