1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,880
The other day I talked to you about

2
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,600
the importance of dedication in Sahaja Yoga

3
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
and the devotion that one should have.

4
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,560
Actually, when we are close to the mountain,

5
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,560
we can’t see much of it,

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,240
and that’s why we don’t realize

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,720
the volume that is so close to us,

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,720
the greatness that is facing us.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,720
This is one of the illusions that works out

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,840
for people who do not realize it mentally —

11
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,720
what they are in for,

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
where are they, what have they found,

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
what is Self-realization, what is its magnitude,

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,880
how far they have to go,

15
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,480
why are they chosen, what is their purpose of life,

16
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,440
how far they have come up, how far they can understand.

17
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,040
All these things are beyond the grasp,

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,080
and one gets stunned, one doesn’t know

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,960
what has happened to him when he got Realization actually.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,560
That’s why to understand this is only possible

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,320
if you can understand how to dedicate,

22
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,680
how to devote yourself.

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,280
If you want to analyze anything

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,800
on the basis of your rationality, you are too stunned.

25
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,800
It’s too beyond you. It’s fantastic.

26
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,000
It is too much. It’s really beyond you.

27
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Now think of it — you have got Realization. Can you believe it?

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,200
That you can, in your life time…

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,880
if somebody had told you this, you would never have believed it —

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,600
that how can you get your Realization in this earth?

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,040
Of course you were seeking —

32
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,000
because people were saying we have to seek,

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
also you felt you have to seek —

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,160
but you never thought that this will materialize like this,

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,920
that you will get your Realization.

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Then, after getting Realization, you could not feel what it was.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,040
Just if you have dropped into the ocean,

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,360
and you don’t know what is the dimension of this ocean.

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,800
How far you have gone into it?

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,960
What is it? Where are we? What is our purpose?

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,160
To add up to all the mess, we become thoughtless.

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:09,520
So you cannot even find out as to, rationally, what it is.

43
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,880
So, the immensity of this experience,

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,760
the glory of your Mother’s coming,

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,360
or the precious gift of your Self-realization —

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,560
nothing can be realized through your understanding.

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Try to think — what have you got?

48
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,320
Can you measure it with your understanding?

49
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Can you understand what has happened?

50
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,200
No, you cannot.

51
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
Because rationality cannot give you

52
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,560
the dimensions into which you have fallen.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,520
The rationality is actually broken out.

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,080
There is no rationality left now anymore

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
to even communicate as to what you have been

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,120
seeking and where have you landed.

57
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,680
So the only method you have got now —

58
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,680
or only way is left to you —

59
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,720
for a drop which has become an ocean,

60
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,080
is to dissolve more in the ocean,

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,880
so that you feel the ocean at least.

62
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,480
And to communicate with other drops

63
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,880
in such a way that you know the whole through all of them.

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,280
So first is a complete devotion. It’s very important.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,120
In this incarnation only it is so very important —

66
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,440
because you have got Realization.

67
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,160
If you did not have Realization — all right.

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,040
Murmuring souls — all right. Half-baked people — all right.

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,200
Little bit misbehaving — all right.

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,760
This can be forgiven, that can be forgiven… everything is forgiven.

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,520
To look at it, everybody thinks that “Mother is forgiving us.”

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,240
But that’s not the point.

73
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,120
I am forgiving because of My own nature.

74
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
But you do not take it for granted.

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,800
You are harming yourself by accepting that forgiveness.

76
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
If you all the time think,

77
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,600
“O Mother, You are so forgiving, please forgive me”…

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
you are already forgiven, as it is.

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,920
Once you call Me “Mother”, you’re forgiven.

80
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,000
But what’s the advantage?

81
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,760
You don’t have any advantage out of it.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
You are a loser.

83
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,960
And this point at least rationally if you understand,

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,880
then you will understand what is a devotion.

85
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,920
So, in devotion of Sahaja Yoga, one has to realize

86
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,120
that the things that are in Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,680
that you have seen in Sahaja Yoga,

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,240
are beyond your mind — first thing.

89
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Definitely, they are beyond human conception.

90
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,720
So, on human level, you do not discuss them,

91
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,120
and you do not talk about them.

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,280
But on the collective level you can talk.

93
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,000
And when you come to the collective level,

94
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
then you have to understand

95
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,040
that relationship with Me is more established, better established

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
if you establish your relationships with others,

97
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,720
in a very collective and homogeneous way.

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,800
As I told you, the drop becomes the ocean;

99
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,880
and the drop has to become the ocean

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,920
by dissolving all its “dropness”

101
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,440
with other drops.

102
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,840
And all the drops dropping their dropness

103
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
become the ocean ultimately.

104
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,880
So we’ll see that devotion is double-wedged:

105
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,920
one is to each other, and one is to your Mother.

106
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,680
In Sahaja Yoga, whatever I see, you cannot see.

107
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,320
This is proved or not — to you people?

108
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,160
Or do you want more proofs?

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,120
Now it is proved that “Mother sees much beyond us,

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,920
and whatever She sees happens.”

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,960
So anybody who tries to play tricks with Mother

112
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,720
is actually playing tricks with himself.

113
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,560
Any tricks you try to play with Me, or you think

114
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,280
that “Mother is very forgiving, so She will forgive us” —

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,160
is really you are torturing yourself,

116
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,680
you are… it is detrimental to you.

117
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Many people are there who will say that “It is my Left Swadisthana.”

118
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,200
Some will say, “I was possessed; there was bhoot.”

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Somebody will blame something else.

120
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
Whatever you are blaming —

121
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,440
actually, who is asking you the explanation?

122
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,640
It’s only you asking yourself.

123
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,600
You are not facing yourself.

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,800
So the devotion to Me means actually facing to yourself.

125
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,240
You face yourself first of all,

126
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,560
and see for yourself what are you doing.

127
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,040
You are your own enemy; nobody is your enemy.

128
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,920
Your Mother is not, definitely. She’s not your enemy by any chance.

129
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,400
And no bhoots are your enemies — in the way,

130
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,120
if you do not allow them, they can’t be there.

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
No evil person is your enemy,

132
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,760
because he cannot be effective if you are spiritually equipped.

133
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,480
So you are your own enemy, is decided now.

134
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,200
The only way to get rid of that enemy of yours -

135
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
you have to dedicate.

136
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,520
Supposing you say

137
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,720
that “I have faith in Mother,” or “in God.”

138
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,560
So you are holding on to something, isn’t it?

139
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,880
And you are discarding something.

140
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,680
But this hold has to be very strong.

141
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Rationally, if you at that time when you are sinking,

142
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,520
will you rationalize, “Whether I should hold the hand

143
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,320
of this person who is saving, is correct or not?”

144
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,000
No, you’ll just… your grip will be very strong.

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,440
It will be extremely strong,

146
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,800
and you will grip it with full force, with full faith —

147
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,160
that “Some or other, save me!”

148
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,560
And that kind of a feeling should be within us

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,840
that “I am a person who is sinking because of myself.

150
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,240
And if I am to be saved, I have to be absolutely,

151
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,480
completely submerged in Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,840
Absolutely I have to become one with it,

153
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
then only I can be saved.”

154
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
Because at this level,

155
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,320
where you are realized souls of a higher level…

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,720
now for a next jump, as I was saying to you — is devotion.

157
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,080
Anything else has to be secondary, under the circumstances.

158
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,960
If it is primary

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,960
and your attention is still on that,

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
then you cannot have this second jump.

161
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,600
First jump you have already done, you have got your Realization.

162
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
But from first jump to second jump —

163
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
you’ve worked hard, you have come to the second jump —

164
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,560
in the second jump, you have to face it up.

165
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,440
You should not feel disgusted with yourself

166
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,720
nor dejected with yourself for nothing.

167
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,960
But treat yourself as a separate entity.

168
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
And dedication is, actually, turning back to yourself

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,880
and looking forward

170
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,440
towards the divine personality in you.

171
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,760
Once there is divine personality in you,

172
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
there’s no problem of devotion.

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,240
You’ll just become one with it; you’ll start enjoying it.

174
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,120
But this rationality is the worst thing,

175
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,000
that plays tricks with you,

176
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,600
which deviates you from understanding

177
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,000
that whatever life you have led so far

178
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,680
has been on a very material, gross life.

179
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,560
You came out of it, you have grown out of it, you have come up.

180
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Now, to blossom, to become fragrant,

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,640
you have to give up rationality. That’s a binding [POINT?].

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,920
Try to avoid rationality, try to avoid arguments,

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,960
try to avoid giving reasons and…

184
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,320
Even now I find sometimes Sahaja Yogis give

185
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,720
an explanation of psychology:

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
“She might be insecured, Mother.”

187
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,000
This is typically somewhere read in the book:

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
“Because of insecurity, somebody does that.”

189
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Actually, now we have seen in Sahaja Yoga

190
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,080
that most of the so-called insecured are the most aggressive people.

191
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,240
They play tricks with others, spoil their lives — and enjoy it.

192
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,760
They are the greatest sadists ever born.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
We have seen these people.

194
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,240
“She is inse…” — and that’s how they play tricks with themselves.

195
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,760
Now, once you understand

196
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,000
that you are not to play tricks with yourself…

197
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
why do you want to play tricks with yourself?

198
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,920
You have to be yourself, that’s all.

199
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,520
We should not be our own enemies. Are we?

200
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,080
So, once you start facing yourself, you will like yourself.

201
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,720
You won’t feel disgusted.

202
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
Because that what “yourself” I’m talking about

203
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,760
is glorious, is beautiful,

204
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,880
is without any kalanka [blemish] on that, is absolutely detached.

205
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,120
But, first of all, your attention has to accept it —

206
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,000
that “This detachment is my life; I’m a different personality now.

207
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,440
Detachment is my nourishment.”

208
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,440
Detach yourself.

209
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,600
One gentleman came to see Me in My house.

210
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,560
I had a very beautiful lamp, and he liked it.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,640
I said, “You have it.” He was so amazed, you see.

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,400
Wife telephoned to Me: “How could it be?

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
How could You give away such a nice thing?” I said, “What’s there?

214
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,800
Am I going to carry it with Me when I die?

215
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,720
Is it going to go with Me? Just see rationally.

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,360
If he has liked it, better have it.

217
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,640
I have so many lamps in the house;

218
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,760
if he takes one, what does it matter?”

219
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,080
She said, “But, You see, I asked my husband,

220
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,480
‘Will you give this lamp — like this if you had — to Her?’

221
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,680
He said, ‘No, I would not.’

222
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,000
‘I’m really… I would not’, he said.”

223
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,120
He was very honest. He said, “I would not.”

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,840
But still, I can’t understand why not?

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,360
So, you know, till the last end

226
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,280
we are holding on to something very little there.

227
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,280
This… even a little bit is holding the sari.

228
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
You know that, that can hold the whole sari.

229
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,120
Even a little bit is attaching to this sari —

230
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
the sari can be held back.

231
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,440
The whole thing you can hold it with one little pin.

232
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,800
All these small pins that are there — the hangs-up —

233
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,320
are to be denied, to be seen… going further.

234
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,680
Look at yourself: “Oh, that’s Mr. Ego?

235
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,720
All right, now recede; let me see how do you go back.”

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,560
To see all those things…

237
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,160
you see, as a play, you should see yourself.

238
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
And then play tricks with your ego and superego.

239
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,840
Actually, they’re playing tricks with you.

240
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,600
Once you are a master, you play tricks with them.

241
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,760
So many times I have seen:

242
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,080
I’ve said so many things, and they are again…

243
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,800
then, after some time, people start talking about it.

244
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,880
Within one or two months after that,

245
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,400
it comes as a scientific proof or things like that.

246
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,720
You have seen that, many a times it has happened.

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,760
Now, when I say something, I’m sure about it, what I say.

248
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
I never say anything but the truth.

249
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,360
I know that I am saying only the truth.

250
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,000
But I do not go inside and find out whether it is the truth or not.

251
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,200
I don’t read a book to find out. I don’t ask you.

252
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,080
I have faith in Myself, full faith in Myself.

253
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,040
Whatever I say is the truth;

254
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,720
I know for definite that I… whatever I say comes out truth.

255
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,040
But that’s not your case.

256
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,320
That’s not your case, that whatever you say is the truth.

257
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,800
So first you have to establish this state —

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,400
that “Whatever I say will be the truth.”

259
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,040
Now, how do you do it? The tongue should be such

260
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,200
that whatever you say should be the truth.

261
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,640
Ultimately, it will come out as truth.

262
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,520
And that is why the dedication should be there.

263
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,480
What dedication? “Why should I tell lies?”

264
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,960
There is no need to tell lies.

265
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,520
Even if I tell lies, it will come truth — in My case.

266
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,000
So-called lies. They are never lies.

267
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,600
If I say to somebody, “He is a bad man” —

268
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,520
apparently to you: “Oh, Mother, he is such a fine man!

269
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,280
How can You say such a thing about him?”

270
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,600
We had one Mr. Michael like that.

271
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,760
“Oh, he is such a loving person, Mother.”

272
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,360
Somebody said, “Mother, are you jealous of him?”

273
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,240
Up to that extent, you know.

274
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,080
But when he showed his real teeth, you see, then people knew.

275
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,280
So, to develop that kind of understanding about the truth,

276
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
first of all, you should absolutely fix yourself on the truth.

277
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,560
And the truth is that you are the instrument of God,

278
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,120
that you have got Realization,

279
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,200
that you have got a special awareness,

280
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,880
which people do not have. Stand on that.

281
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,520
And proclaim it. You are not to be afraid of it.

282
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
You have got Realization, no doubt. You have felt it.

283
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,080
Say it: “I’ve got Realization.

284
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,360
Nothing doing, I know I’m a realized soul.” Firm on that.

285
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,040
In this expression of truth, you have to be like the light.

286
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,680
The light asserts.

287
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,080
It not only asserts but it shows others also that it shines.

288
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,560
It shows others that “I am the light,”

289
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,480
that “You walk in my light,

290
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,120
and if you don’t try to do it, I may burn you.”

291
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
So they have that… what you call, that…

292
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,840
I don’t know what’s the word is… Tejasvita. Tejas.

293
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
Sharpness of light.

294
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,280
That tejasvita is there, that sharpness of light.

295
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,200
That is the proof of your truth.

296
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,280
You are not afraid of any prime minister,

297
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,680
or any minister, or any king, or anyone.

298
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,320
But — “This is the fact. That’s the thing.

299
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,680
I know I am a realized soul, I am the truth.”

300
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,960
If you say, “I’m the truth,” whatever you will say

301
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,320
will be the truth, no doubt about it.

302
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,840
Whatever you will do will be the truth. But say, “I’m the truth.”

303
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,480
But for that, a real purification is needed

304
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,960
about facing yourself fully, in dedication.

305
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
Means you are holding on to your Mother,

306
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
you are holding on to Sahaja Yoga,

307
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,120
you are holding on to that truth which you have found out.

308
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,840
And here you are facing others.

309
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,800
Without that you cannot do it; your source is that.

310
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,720
You are standing on the truth.

311
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,880
And that is such a power, such a strength.

312
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,560
All of them if you see — Christ had that power,

313
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,280
Mohammed had that power — all these great people had that power

314
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,200
to say the truth, with full courage,

315
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,040
with that assertion that people will accept it.

316
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,360
And they would suffer even for that, they wouldn’t mind.

317
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,680
But whatever is the truth has to be said.

318
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,000
That’s the first point one should know about dedication —

319
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,560
that you are dedicated fully,

320
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,960
that you are not afraid of anyone.

321
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,600
You are not worried about your losses.

322
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
Some people have lost their heads also,

323
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,280
completely cut their heads. People have tortured them.

324
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Some people have been… taken away all their money,

325
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
have been tortured in every way,

326
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
but they thought this was the truth, they stood by it.

327
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,440
Some of them were stupid fools; they stood for something

328
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,360
that was not truth. They did.

329
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,520
But now you know that you are standing on the truth,

330
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,640
and for that, you should be willing to sacrifice anything —

331
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,480
so-called sacrifice, because you are not sacrificing the truth.

332
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
What you had tried sacrificing is untruth.

333
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,720
For that, you require people of strength and courage,

334
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,640
and not these half-baked people.

335
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
You see, till morning till evening

336
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,480
asking for forgiveness from Mother. What is it?

337
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
What is there to ask for forgiveness —

338
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,880
because I am forgiving you every moment.

339
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,360
But what are you doing to yourself? What sort of a person you are?

340
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
You think about it, that you have to stand on the truth.

341
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,360
For that, you have to be a strong, courageous person

342
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,880
with that sharpness, that tejasvita within you —

343
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,200
of the light of the beacon.

344
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,200
But at the same time, you have to have complete dedication.

345
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,920
Supposing there is no oil in this — it will all go off.

346
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,240
It has to have oil.

347
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,480
It will go off.

348
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,640
So the dedication part is the oil in you,

349
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,720
is the attachment, complete attachment to your source.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,080
That’s the dedication.

351
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,040
But that dedication should not give you

352
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,240
any other ideas but of a light which shines,

353
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,840
which corrects others, guides the path of other people.

354
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
If that is not so, then the source that you are tapping

355
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,840
is not coming to you fully,

356
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,040
and that your light is not burning properly.

357
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,640
So, into dedication when you go,

358
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,720
you must not think that it is any surrendering —

359
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,720
the so-called surrendering, that you become like a cabbage.

360
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,760
That’s the idea people have — that you become like cabbage.

361
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,600
But you become dynamic.

362
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,640
You become real power —

363
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,680
not of destruction but of construction.

364
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,240
I mean, for destruction you don’t need much power.

365
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Only for construction you need power.

366
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,600
For destruction how much do you need? Very little.

367
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,040
You can destroy the whole thing in no time.

368
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:51,680
But for the construction you really require great power.

369
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,640
And that power — sustained power,

370
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
or flowing power — has to be there.

371
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,160
For that, dedication is needed.

372
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,920
Holding on to your source of power,

373
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,240
you have to stand firm, courageously,

374
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,480
without any fear.

375
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,440
That’s the truth.

376
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,200
That’s the truth you have to achieve.

377
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
That’s very important.

378
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,040
But this is only one side of the story.

379
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,920
That’s not sufficient. Just being the truth,

380
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,880
the aspect of one side is there.

381
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,640
But the other side of it is

382
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,880
that when this source comes to you, you become the compassion.

383
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,040
The truth and the compassion are one thing.

384
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,520
You won’t believe, but it is so.

385
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,720
Like the wick and the oil combine to form the light.

386
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,080
It is the burning of the oil gives you the light.

387
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,440
In the same way, the compassion gives you the truth.

388
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,280
There’s no difference whatsoever. Only the state is different —

389
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,960
that you cannot see the light, which is oil,

390
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,800
and oil, which is burning.

391
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,600
So compassion is the one which is the source,

392
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,240
as well as your store.

393
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,480
So, from the source of compassion,

394
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,800
you get your compassion.

395
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:45,200
You see, I have seen people — they want to have compassion from Me,

396
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,880
they want that I should love them.

397
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,240
But — reflect it back — do they love others like that?

398
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,040
I have known people, they have…

399
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,200
say, for one person says harsh thing to another,

400
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,080
and comes and asks Me, “Mother, forgive me for that,”

401
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,200
or does something harsh just for the whim of the mind.

402
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
“Mother, forgive me.”

403
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,240
But when you ask for that, I would like to know:

404
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,960
have you given compassion to another person?

405
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,720
Even after getting forgiveness from Me —

406
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,360
that Source of forgiveness, that Source of compassion —

407
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,840
have you given compassion to others?

408
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,600
Have you been compassionate to others?

409
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
You see, it should not be one-sided.

410
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,800
If you are taking the advantage of My compassion,

411
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,560
it should not be one-sided,

412
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,120
that you use it for your own benefit and forget about it.

413
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,280
Then you will never grow. You will never grow.

414
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,440
If you have to grow, then you must store that compassion within you.

415
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,240
Whatever compassion I’ve given you, love I’ve given you,

416
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,360
you must store that within you — and give that back to others.

417
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Otherwise you will be finished, you will be nowhere.

418
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,440
Is the growth which is sustained only…

419
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,720
not only by sucking from one side but by giving to others.

420
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,880
Otherwise you’ll be stagnated.

421
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,200
There has to be outflow.

422
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,280
But that is a very hard thing

423
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,880
because people are very good at taking compassion from Mother.

424
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,040
Or even if they are compassionate,

425
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,440
they will be mostly compassionate to people who are, say…

426
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,760
in, say, Vietnam — not in the ashram.

427
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,320
They are more worried about Vietnam people, you know:

428
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,000
“Oh, Mother, we are worried about Vietnam people,

429
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,800
we are collecting money for them,

430
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,640
we are trying to send money to Vietnam.”

431
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,280
And here among ashramites — fighting.

432
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,720
This is not compassion by any chance.

433
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,080
Sahaja Yogis among themselves are a different race,

434
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,040
and they are to support each other all the time,

435
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,160
and look after them.

436
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,840
When I find Sahaja Yogis criticizing Sahaja Yogis, I’m amazed.

437
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,760
I’m really amazed.

438
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,080
Because you are part and parcel of the same.

439
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,400
How can you criticize? One eye criticizing another person —

440
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,840
I just can’t understand.

441
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,160
I can criticize, all right, but why should you?

442
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
Why should you criticize each other?

443
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,640
Only thing that you have to do is to love each other.

444
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,040
Christ has said it thrice,

445
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I must have said it a hundred and eight times already —

446
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,520
that you have to love each other.

447
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,320
That is the only way you are expressing compassion.

448
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,840
If I’ve given you any love any time,

449
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,080
you have to have patience with others, love for others.

450
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,840
I sometimes try to coax people,

451
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,840
and I find that people immediately come out

452
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,280
with some sort of a criticism of others, or something like that.

453
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Now, the basic thing is that our compassion,

454
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,960
if that is flowing,

455
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,040
then only we can get compassion from Mother.

456
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,480
There is no place any more; I’ve done too much compassion business.

457
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,880
And what I find that now unless and until you flow it,

458
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,080
how am I to give you compassion? I mean, there is no space left now.

459
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,680
So better give it away, empty yourself a little bit,

460
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,120
then I can give you more compassion.

461
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,720
It’s simple business.

462
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,480
In this respect, one has to understand

463
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,880
that the source cannot flow

464
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,960
unless and until it expands the flow of it.

465
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,400
Like the river Thames. We went to see the river Thames,

466
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,720
the place from where it starts.

467
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,920
It’s a small, little stream from seven streams —

468
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,080
little little, very little little — we can say, trickling down.

469
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
And it has become a river Thames.

470
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,840
Supposing it does not widens —

471
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
that will stop at the beginning only.

472
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,640
It cannot come out, it cannot flow.

473
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,680
It’s not because it is angry, or upset, or anything like that,

474
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,520
but by the nature of its flow only

475
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,800
it cannot flow, what to do?

476
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,880
So, that is what it is —

477
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,320
that one has to give compassion to others.

478
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,000
It should not be formal compassion, or affected one,

479
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,440
but should be a natural one, very natural,

480
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,160
spontaneous, feeling from within.

481
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,120
It’s not an expression of your ego,

482
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,840
or superego, or over-sentimentality,

483
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,560
but is a kind of a understanding that he is a Sahaja Yogi,

484
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,000
you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are brothers.

485
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Not the way the brothers have been

486
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,240
but a different type of brothers who are spiritual brothers.

487
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,680
You are spiritual people.

488
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,800
So this compassion has to be there,

489
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
and unless and until you develop that compassionate,

490
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,120
fatherly or motherly feelings for others…

491
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,920
I mean, I am a Mother of a person

492
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,560
who is about hundred and eight years of age.

493
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,080
You have to really mother others,

494
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,160
and have that feeling of compassion and love for others.

495
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,360
You don’t have to think about your own comfort,

496
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,240
you don’t have to think about your own advantages,

497
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,880
but you have to think about the comfort of others.

498
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,200
You have to think what you can do to make others comfortable,

499
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,600
than to see what will make you comfortable.

500
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,640
So this flow of compassion, when it starts, you see,

501
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,200
the dedication is complete.

502
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Because “whatever we got from You, Mother,

503
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,240
we are giving it to others.” That’s the dedication.

504
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,400
So the flow of dedication is not one-sided.

505
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,960
It is double-sided.

506
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
You stick on to something,

507
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,400
you get connected with something to get something out of it,

508
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,840
and you give it to others.

509
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,800
And ultimately that reaches the collective being —

510
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,600
means it reaches the source.

511
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,440
It is in this light we have to understand.

512
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Exclusiveness, or “We should — now married —

513
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,520
we should have separate place,

514
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
we should live separately” — it’s all right,

515
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,000
you must have little privacy as a married people,

516
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,560
I’m not saying that.

517
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,600
But as far as compassion is concerned,

518
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,920
as married people you have to be much more compassionate.

519
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,560
But you’ll only worry about your own children,

520
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,160
about your own comfort,

521
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,000
about your own husband, about your own wife.

522
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,040
In Sahaja Yoga, there is no place for such people.

523
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,520
It’s all collective.

524
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,520
When you bring sweets for your own child,

525
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,360
bring for other children in the ashram.

526
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,000
You are one family,

527
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,400
and all the family has to move with the same waves.

528
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,520
I had told you before

529
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,960
that we cannot have separate food arrangements,

530
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,120
separate this and separate that.

531
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,520
In the same way, we cannot have separate standards

532
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,040
of living for different people.

533
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,800
We all have to enjoy whatever is enjoyed by all of you.

534
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,040
That should be so.

535
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,080
And that should be achieved on material level.

536
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,760
On emotional level, any marriage which is absurd,

537
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,920
which makes everyone unhappy is useless.

538
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,720
But marriages are made to make everyone happy.

539
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,760
So, before you decide to marry,

540
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,040
think that you are not playing tricks.

541
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,720
Playing tricks in Sahaja Yoga is very, very dangerous.

542
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,640
You are not playing tricks with your marriages;

543
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,840
you are not trying to involve somebody else,

544
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,880
thinking that Mother will forgive you and all that.

545
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,120
I will forgive. But your ascent is difficult.

546
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,640
So don’t try to play tricks with anything

547
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,720
that you have been doing before,

548
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,320
but change yourself completely, transform yourself completely.

549
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,960
Now you change your attitude towards life.

550
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,080
You can because it is changed already.

551
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,880
If you try to be the other person, you cannot be.

552
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,440
Now you have become a flower, now you can’t become

553
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,480
suddenly the leaf.

554
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,120
Now you are a flower, and you have to live like a flower.

555
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,240
And that’s what you have to remember —

556
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,240
that compassion is such an outflow,

557
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,560
is such a natural thing for a Sahaja Yogi.

558
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,040
It’s not natural for anybody else.

559
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,080
Other people who talk of compassion, or this and that,

560
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,160
are actually… are not at all compassionate.

561
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,080
They are doing it for money; they are doing it for position;

562
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,960
they are doing for ego satisfaction.

563
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
But you are having compassion

564
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,000
because you have to have it, jolly well.

565
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,680
It is flowing, the compassion — because it has to flow.

566
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,560
And you are doing compassion because of compassion.

567
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,280
There is no other purpose behind it.

568
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,040
Only this will give you something

569
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,600
that is of permanent nature, of a sthayi nature.

570
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,960
I’ve seen people — as I was telling in the morning —

571
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,760
who have gone to an organization,

572
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
made a beautiful organization out of it,

573
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,280
and once they leave, the organization is finished.

574
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,840
Because they do not give anything substantial to that organization.

575
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,480
And what is to be given is a large heart of compassion.

576
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,920
If you do not give that,

577
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,360
once you go away from that, the rest of them are again barren.

578
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,920
It’s not a growth.

579
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,520
Like if you bring water, and plant things,

580
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,320
and give water to that area, then it becomes very beautiful,

581
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,080
and you can say it’s a very lush growth.

582
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,360
But as soon as that water source is removed,

583
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,600
it gets again dried out.

584
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,520
But Sahaja Yoga is different.

585
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,680
In Sahaja Yoga you not only grow as a plant

586
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,000
but also as the source of the plant.

587
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,760
If this plant is removed from here, put somewhere,

588
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,120
it will give water to other plants.

589
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,320
Do you know this new dimension that you have within yourself?

590
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,520
That once this plant is uprooted from here and taken out,

591
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,200
it will not die, not at all. It will grow.

592
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,000
But it will make others grow.

593
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,760
This is another type of a growth that we have.

594
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,040
And it’s a very different position we are in.

595
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,200
And that’s what now I want — that all of you,

596
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,240
even if you are uprooted and put into any other place…

597
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,960
I’ve seen, when I ask people

598
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,040
that “You better shift from here to there,”

599
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,200
they just get frightened.

600
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,840
“You better go there and do this” — they get frightened.

601
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,440
You are a plant which can not only go and prosper in any place

602
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,120
but you will give

603
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
the necessary nourishment to other plants.

604
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,200
That’s what you are.

605
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,640
So do not stick on to one place. If you stick on, then

606
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,960
think there must be something wrong with the place.

607
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,360
Like a glue if you are sticking to one place, it’s very dangerous.

608
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,240
And be sure that you must turn

609
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,160
away from such a place which glues you.

610
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,200
That does not mean that, as people are here,

611
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,520
they never stay in the house, they all the time running out.

612
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,840
It doesn’t mean. Again I have to strike that point.

613
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,920
Because otherwise the people are here…

614
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,080
are all the time running away from their houses.

615
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,520
That’s not the point.

616
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,080
The point is that you should not be glued to anything

617
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,600
and not afraid of leaving any place,

618
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,880
because now you are Sahaja Yogis.

619
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,760
You have joined the ocean, and ocean can take you anywhere.

620
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,000
So just prepare yourself to move into any place

621
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,160
because you have to take this compassion everywhere.

622
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
And to prosper the Kingdom of God,

623
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,480
you have to serve Him.

624
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
And this service only possible if you know

625
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,600
that you are here for a very great, universal task.

626
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,640
Not only for England, for India, or for America,

627
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,200
but you are here for a global task,

628
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,840
which is the epitome of our evolution.

629
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,440
This is the highest thing we have to do

630
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,760
for our Creation and for our Creator,

631
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,600
and you are chosen for that.

632
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,000
So don’t divert your attention to anything

633
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,200
that is not fulfilling your own manifestation.

634
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,440
Discard all that. Don’t waste your energy.

635
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,600
And your manifestation is your compassion, your love.

636
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,040
But still, it should not remain rational.

637
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,200
Whatever I have said to you is just to put you into a condition

638
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,720
where you start sucking the vibrations

639
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,360
as well as giving the vibrations.

640
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,200
It is an action,

641
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,240
which is a happening that should take place within you.

642
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,240
It’s not rationality, it’s not thinking about it.

643
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,680
Only by saying these things I really stun your thinking.

644
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,200
You should allow this to happen to you.

645
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Just with the vibratory awareness you should judge yourself:

646
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,720
“Am I the one who is giving vibrations to others?

647
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Am I the one who has stored these vibrations,

648
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,480
or am I getting ruined?”

649
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,680
All this will give you a great meaning —

650
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,520
and an employment. As I said, “employed by God.”

651
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,480
If you have any questions, ask Me.

652
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,280
YOGI: Mother, if you become angry at any point with people,

653
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,560
is that because it’s a tendency

654
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,960
or a negative entity?

655
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,800
Or is it just a tendency to react like that?

656
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,800
SHRI MATAJI: You see, if you get angry within yourself,

657
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,280
and if you are sure that you are not doing anything wrong,

658
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,840
for a Sahaja Yogi there is no need to say outside you are angry.

659
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,240
There’s no need. That anger itself is a power.

660
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,360
And you should do your bandhan and anything that you want to do.

661
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,920
But you should not show that you are angry.

662
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
You should be absolutely silent. Because you can be;

663
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,160
you are in the axis, you are not on the periphery.

664
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,680
Actually, the anger is just to see your anger

665
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,400
and use that anger for that purpose.

666
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:47,880
And once you start doing that, that anger will itself work out.

667
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,680
That anger will itself work out the person.

668
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,920
And you’ll be amazed how it… but you must learn to see your anger

669
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,800
that is working.

670
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,840
All these things are important. You have seen that sometimes

671
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,680
only shouting at the bhoots — they go away.

672
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,960
And many mad people have been cured like that.

673
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,640
But you don’t do all that, that’s for Me.

674
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,080
You must be always decent, with decorum and all that.

675
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,040
But if the anger is because of your nature,

676
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,800
or a tendency, or out of control — than it’s a bad thing.

677
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,440
If it is an out-of-control, than it’s a bad thing.

678
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,880
If you get into a temper because it is out of control,

679
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,880
than it’s a bad thing. I can get very angry,

680
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,800
but I am completely under control: I know I am angry,

681
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,720
where the bhoot is, how he is running away; I can see it.

682
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,120
But you can’t see the bhoot, you can’t see anything.

683
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,680
So there is no need for you to get angry, show temper.

684
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,720
But if you have an anger —

685
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,000
say, for example, which makes you uncontrollable —

686
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,720
then there is a mantra for that: Shanti [peace].

687
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,080
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

688
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,000
You must ask for that bliss, for that peace.

689
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,960
This is a mantra for you.

690
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,560
For controlling your temper, you have to tell yourself,

691
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,920
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

692
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,600
So Shanti is the point — the axis point is that —

693
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
from where you witness everything.

694
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,000
You are in Shanti, you are in complete…

695
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,840
you are not in a turmoil even if you are angry.

696
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,040
You are not in a turmoil. Whatever is anger is the power,

697
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,560
and the power is taking charge.

698
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,840
But unless and until that is achieved, what you have to do is to put

699
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,480
yourself in a position that you are peaceful.

700
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,840
So I think that’s a very good mantra —

701
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,240
is to say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Shanti rupena samsthita.”

702
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,880
Can you say that?

703
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,480
So the Shanti is your fort.

704
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,720
But peacefulness never means cowardice.

705
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,800
Never call cowardice as peace.

706
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,080
A person who is peaceful is never coward,

707
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,920
because nothing can transgress it, nothing can overpower it.

708
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,280
It is never never

709
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,520
possible that cowardice and peace can go together.

710
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
But your power is inside, not outside.

711
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,920
So you don’t show your power of your anger outside.

712
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,080
But just little anger with anybody — you will see it will work out.

713
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,600
But first establish that…

714
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,600
that position within you where you are the axis,

715
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,840
where you do not allow anger to sit on your head.

716
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,320
That is the growth. That is the growth, that you are at peace.

717
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,680
Also… Another question? All right, satisfied now?

718
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,160
Both ways you should know:

719
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,680
that one is the anger that is detached — is perfectly all right;

720
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,000
anger which involves you — work it out.

721
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,440
So judge yourself as to what it is.

722
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Good question.

723
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,480
Ask some questions.

724
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,320
I mean, such intellectuals sitting here.

725
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,880
Ask Me some questions what is there.

726
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,800
YOGI: Mother, [HAVE YOU PREPARED?] Your plans

727
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,320
to spread Sahaja Yoga [IN OUTER SCALE?]?

728
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,320
SHRI MATAJI: What are My plans?

729
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,120
I don’t plan. You see, I don’t plan, because I don’t know

730
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,360
how far My instruments are ready, you see.

731
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
First, now My only plans — if I have any —

732
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,680
is to really prepare My weapons all right.

733
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,080
Once they are done, then we’ll fix them up.

734
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,920
You see, unless and until you know how far your bomb can fall,

735
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,080
how can you plan it?

736
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,440
So, first of all, I must measure up

737
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,360
the power of My children, how powerful they are.

738
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,760
That’s what I’m trying to do now —

739
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,520
is to make them aware of their powers to use.

740
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,160
Like, you see, Hanumana, when He was born and when He grew up,

741
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,200
He forgot that time, and He forgot His powers.

742
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,640
So He was to be reminded

743
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,960
that “You are such and such powerful person.

744
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,360
You don’t know what your powers are, you…

745
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,640
you ate of the whole of Surya.

746
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,400
This you did in your childhood. You are born with this power,

747
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,080
but now, after growing,

748
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,120
you are… rather bit… sort of forgotten it,

749
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,600
and also you were afraid of using them, and it’s…

750
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,200
sort of looks like in the dominant position.

751
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,480
But it is there. If you just try to remember them, it will come up.”

752
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,480
They have tremendous power, these people have tremendous power.

753
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,200
But they have to assume and stand on that.

754
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,720
If they do not do it…

755
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,920
You see, if I tell them, “Now, go to this house” —

756
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,680
“Oh, Mother, there may be a bhoot there sitting.”

757
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,040
A person comes possessed in the ashram —

758
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,960
they all shut their doors: “Oh God, this bhoot has come.”

759
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,160
Or something — then worse.

760
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,720
YOGI: Mother, may I ask You something?

761
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,320
How can we deal with… You see, there is one problem in…

762
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,680
one big problem in Sahaja Yoga, You know.

763
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,280
It’s… those who are devoted to You at the expense of others.

764
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,920
SHRI MATAJI: Those who are devoted to Me…

765
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,360
YOGI: Or those who use the excuse of their devoting to You, Mother,

766
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,280
sometimes to oppress others.

767
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,320
SHRI MATAJI: They are what?

768
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,000
YOGI: Sometimes people use their devotion to You

769
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,000
as… at the expense of others, or…

770
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,320
SHRI MATAJI:Then again the same thing, Djamel, is the same thing is.

771
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,760
You see, it is… you have to do it, all those who are doing that way.

772
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,360
I’m just pointing out to all those.

773
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,320
If you are using, say, your devotion to Me

774
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,440
for the oppressing of others, all right?

775
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,440
So it is for you to see.

776
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,600
There is nobody who can be oppressed,

777
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,240
because your Spirit cannot be oppressed.

778
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,360
Say, there is X and Y.

779
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,520
Now, Y is a person who’s trying to oppress X, all right?

780
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,160
What will you oppress? He can’t oppress his Spirit, can he?

781
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,920
First point. Clear.

782
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,480
Now, this fellow, if he has to have

783
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,880
attachment to Me, nobody can stop him.

784
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,880
There is all… you all have direct relationship with Me.

785
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,280
Not through anyone.

786
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,640
If you want to accept somebody’s agency, then I can’t help you.

787
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,040
But, otherwise, you all have a direct access to Me.

788
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,680
You all can grow your Spirits; nobody can dominate you.

789
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,600
Everyone has complete freedom to grow their Spirit —

790
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,440
to know their Spirit, I mean to say.

791
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:24,480
And the Spirit is something… cannot be dominated by anyone.

792
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
Now, supposing somebody tries to oppress you.

793
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,760
What will they oppress you, in which way?

794
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,480
They’ll say, “All right, we’ll not have this carpet,

795
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,520
we’ll have that carpet.” Have it!

796
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,720
Somebody will say, “I’ll jump in the sea.” Jump! Just now you jump!

797
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,600
What will they oppress you in? You see, just see that.

798
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,800
Not in your spiritual growth. Can they?

799
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,120
And that’s how the problem starts.

800
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,440
You see, in material things…

801
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,600
say, in an ashram now somebody says,

802
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,680
“All right, we would like to have a photograph of Mother put there.”

803
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,560
The other will say, “No, we are going to have it there.”

804
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,040
Whether you put it here or there makes no difference.

805
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,480
My photograph is going to work it out.

806
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,560
Even in puja matters I’ve seen:

807
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,160
people will say that “No, Mother is sitting there,

808
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,480
don’t put your feet towards the Mother.”

809
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,920
It is common thing; everybody knows should not put it.

810
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,680
But still they will say, “No, we want to put it.”

811
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,360
All right, let them put it.

812
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,920
Next time they will not, because they will know it is wrong.

813
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,640
They will find out.

814
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,520
So, you see, nobody can oppress anyone.

815
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,880
I am here to correct. Once you understand

816
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,920
that you are not perfect, the other is not perfect,

817
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,920
we are all perfecting ourselves, we are all coming up,

818
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,960
Mother is there to look after us —

819
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,280
then we will never think like that.

820
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,520
Now. I’ve also seen, people will say

821
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,160
that there are two Sahaja Yogis talking to others… Sahaja Yogis.

822
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,360
Now, one is a very oppressive one,

823
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,680
the another one is upset to see that this one is oppressive.

824
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,520
Now, for that purpose, if you are quiet, silent —

825
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,200
you will always dominate him.

826
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,640
People will listen to you, not to him.

827
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,440
But even if you start saying,

828
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,760
“Oh, you don’t say like that,” this, this,

829
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,360
they will think these are fighting cocks.

830
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,160
Then, at that time, you are wise at this thing —

831
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,480
will even give him a chance to understand.

832
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,560
But what happens: one person dominates,

833
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,440
another tries to dominate them by outward things.

834
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,120
And the whole show is over.

835
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,040
There is no need to dominate another person by outward things.

836
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,880
He will settle down by himself

837
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,320
if you show your dignity of your silence

838
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,280
and of your understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

839
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,080
There is no need just now to say,

840
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,800
“Shut up, you sit down, you don’t do.” It’s absolutely wrong.

841
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,800
They do it, I’ve seen it. In My presence I’ve seen it.

842
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,240
Because we still live halfway there and halfway here.

843
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,160
The way we solve the problem… say, you have to do some business.

844
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,880
There are two people doing the business. One person says something,

845
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,800
another says, “Why did you say like this, you shouldn’t say.”

846
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,680
This person says to that person, “You shouldn’t correct me.”

847
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,360
Like that the fight is on.

848
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,800
But that doesn’t help anyway… there also.

849
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,720
But in Sahaja Yoga it will never help.

850
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,840
The another person can only win over by his dignity.

851
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,520
By his quiet methods, by approaching a person properly.

852
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,920
That’s how the leaders will come up.

853
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,440
They won’t come up by shooting another person down,

854
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,720
not at all by any chance. That’s not possible.

855
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,440
Is not good leadership.

856
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:44,440
Good leadership is judged the way you handle the situation,

857
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,080
not the way you fight another man down.

858
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,520
So many times you have seen: I just keep quiet — it works out.

859
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,280
Not necessary that you should at that moment shout.

860
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,600
There’s no need.

861
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,760
And it creates a very bad impression and very bad leadership.

862
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,960
First of all, you cannot be dominated. This is one fact, is a truth.

863
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,640
You can grow in your spirituality,

864
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,720
whatever people may try to dominate in the worldly things.

865
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,640
Thank God we don’t have any organization.

866
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,680
Thank God we don’t have secretaries, assistant secretaries,

867
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,200
under-secretaries, by-secretaries,

868
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,680
upper secretaries, lower secretaries — we don’t have any nonsense.

869
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,680
Otherwise, even that would have been dominating to people.

870
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,160
Then they would have fought that. So we don’t have that problem.

871
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,680
We don’t have any money problem,

872
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,080
because we don’t have all these nonsensical ideas.

873
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,480
I’ve solved this problem by having no institutions, no positions.

874
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,680
Everybody has position.

875
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,320
But the greatest position is of your Spirit, which you establish.

876
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,600
The attention is not there, is more ego-oriented.

877
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,080
The whole stuff is ego-oriented.

878
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,720
You can’t fight ego with ego, you cannot.

879
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,640
You can only fight ego or superego with Spirit.

880
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,360
How much do I dominate you?

881
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,600
I absorb all your aggression also.

882
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,040
And how much do I dominate you?

883
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,880
If I have to correct you, I go forward and do it,

884
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,000
and tell you that I’m correcting you, whether you like it or not.

885
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,560
And you see the result, it’s all right.

886
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,160
But if you have that capacity, do it.

887
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,560
Then there is lacking in you, that you cannot do that way,

888
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,640
so be prepared not to, at least, spoil the show of Sahaja Yoga.

889
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,240
One person is talking too much? All right, the others will say,

890
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,640
“He is good for nothing, but another one is a sensible one.”

891
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,240
But if you both are fighting, then I don’t know.

892
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,120
That’s… doesn’t show any wisdom or growth, isn’t it?

893
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Does it?

894
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,320
Those who think that by dominating in small small things

895
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,520
you are going to achieve anything are wrong.

896
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,840
Actually, I’ve seen, My grandchildren are realized souls.

897
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,480
They are not bothered about these things, they don’t do this.

898
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,680
This kind of a fight they don’t have.

899
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,800
That “where to keep this”, “what to do this” — they don’t have.

900
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,000
Nothing.

901
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,120
At the most, they might fight for a chocolate

902
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,080
or something, at the most.

903
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,800
But in spiritual matters, they never fight.

904
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,920
In spiritual matters they never fight.

905
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,880
That’s a place one should not fight,

906
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,240
one should not argue. That’s the point not to be argued,

907
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,320
because truth is one. What is there to argue?

908
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,760
You have seen all these saints, you see,

909
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,840
those who have talked about Me. What do they say?

910
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,720
Everybody says the same thing about Me.

911
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
There cannot be any fight between saints, can there be?

912
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,560
If the truth is one, how can there be fight?

913
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,880
But because one is inadequate, another is dominating —

914
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,760
both must achieve that state.

915
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,040
But the best is to be more dignified,

916
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,360
more grown-up, more patronizing…

917
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,040
People will definitely take to you

918
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,440
because you will become the leader.

919
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,040
Arguments are not going to lead you anywhere,

920
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,920
I can tell you this much.

921
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,440
No use arguing among yourself.

922
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,440
If you have to argue, you have to argue with others,

923
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,640
not among yourself.

924
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,960
Otherwise now? What else?

925
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,120
What is the thing? Any other question?

926
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,000
YOGINI: Mother, would You please tell a little bit how…

927
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,040
how we fight our ego with the Spirit?

928
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,840
How would you do…

929
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,760
SHRI MATAJI: How do we fight the ego…

930
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,040
YOGINI: … ego with the Spirit.

931
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,240
SHRI MATAJI: You see, you should never fight ego.

932
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,160
If you try to fight, it will sit more on your head.

933
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,760
That’s not the way to fight it,

934
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
that there is ego and you fight your ego:

935
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,920
“Oh, I’m going to box you” — then it will grow more, you see.

936
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,680
The more you box it, the more it will grow. Never fight your ego.

937
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,200
Only way is to see it.

938
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,440
Your attention is very important, your attention is now enlightened.

939
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,360
Whatever you see, it comes to its right size.

940
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,880
It comes to its right side… size.

941
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,880
Say, ego — if it is overgrown, you just watch your ego.

942
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,560
That is, it is to watch yourself in the mirror,

943
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,760
and you say, “Oh, Mr. Ego, how do you do?”

944
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:40,800
Then it will come down. But don’t fight it. Just to be seen.

945
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,840
All kinds of egos could be there.

946
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,520
If you are overeducated, you are egoistical.

947
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,880
If you are uneducated, you are egoistical —

948
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,480
because you must try to show that you are something.

949
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,800
All sorts of egos are there.

950
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,560
So best thing is to see for yourself;

951
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,400
that’s why I say, “Face yourself.” “Yourself” means your Spirit.

952
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,000
YOGI: Mother, that goes the same for the superego?

953
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,680
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, very much so.

954
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,000
For superego also — not to be frightened.

955
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,600
You should just say, “Get out!

956
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,080
I can see you very clearly, you are there.

957
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,520
You get out from here! How dare you frighten me? I am the Spirit.

958
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,640
I am the Spirit, how dare you can do that?”

959
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,040
That’s how.

960
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,880
You see, ego makes you idiotic. Absolutely.

961
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,480
Ego makes you idiotic, makes an idiot out of you, absolutely.

962
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,240
And the superego makes you a coward.

963
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,520
It makes you a coward. Now, how to fight it?

964
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,760
“I’m not going to be an idiot” — if you say that, ego will go away.

965
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,040
If you want to be an idiot, then he’ll be there to help you.

966
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,760
If you want to be an idiot, all right, call Mr. Ego.

967
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,720
You’ll become an idiot, straightforward.

968
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,360
Is the easiest way. Easiest way.

969
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,120
If you want to become an idiot, simple thing is to call the ego.

970
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,760
“You come, Mr. Ego, and settle down in me” —

971
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,200
and immediately… this is a very simple composition.

972
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,680
And superego… if you are a coward, then it sits on your head.

973
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,080
Say, “I am not going to be…”

974
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,640
Ham Ksham, as I told you, the mantra on the Agnya is.

975
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,720
Either you have to say, “I am”;

976
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,360
the other, I say, “I forgive you.”

977
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,600
YOGI: Mother, may I ask you a question

978
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,560
similar to what he said about superego?

979
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,760
I’ll be particular.

980
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:49,520
I’m still having problems with my eating.

981
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,120
I’m eating a lot here

982
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,720
but I’m very afraid (I’m laughing ’cause it is silly)

983
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,040
that I’ll become fat.

984
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,840
And I’m very afraid; I think a lot about food, all the time. Yet I…

985
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,080
… I know that with You nothing bad can happen to me.

986
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,960
SHRI MATAJI: All right, you do one thing just now.

987
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,840
You put your left hand towards Me and right hand outside.

988
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,920
She has a Hamsa here, [UNCLEAR].

989
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,200
There. You see, the Hamsa.

990
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,440
Tell her to come down. Come in, come in.

991
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,400
Oh, I see. Sorry.

992
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,800
Put the Hamsa, I didn’t see it clearly.

993
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,520
Hello. [PHRASE IN HINDI]

994
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,960
[WE’VE BEEN?] waiting for you.

995
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,920
Come forward, you can come forward a little bit.

996
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,480
Lots of people are there.

997
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,680
[PHRASE IN HINDI]

998
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,640
What’s the time now?

999
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,800
YOGI: A quarter past nine.

1000
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
SHRI MATAJI: Quarter past nine.

1001
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,840
As I have told you,

1002
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,280
that relationship with yourself should be tyrannical.

1003
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,160
You should lash it down.

1004
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,720
You should absolutely make it clear to yourself

1005
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,640
that “I have to perfect myself if I have to give

1006
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,000
this my being to God. It has to be perfect.”

1007
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,080
Secondly, if you have to have relationship

1008
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,720
with others, it has to be ideal relationship.

1009
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,000
Sahaja Yogi with Sahaja Yogi — means something great.

1010
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,200
The greatest relationship is that.

1011
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,920
With your sister, with your brother — it should be ideal.

1012
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:54,400
And in collectivity we have to be pragmatic.

1013
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,160
In collectivity we can change our course,

1014
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,120
we’ll take the way we like, the way it moves; we’ll manage it.

1015
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,000
But otherwise…

1016
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,760
You see, for example, take a plane. It has the same thing.

1017
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,440
Plane, when it is in the air, it can go wherever it likes.

1018
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,520
But the screws that are fixed in a plane are ideally fixed.

1019
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,440
They cannot just start… like a pilot seat doesn’t go to the back,

1020
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,280
and the back doesn’t come to the front, you see.

1021
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,800
The relationship is maintained. All right?

1022
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,040
And the screws which are made,

1023
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,800
or anything that is made — is perfect.

1024
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,640
But airplane is not fixed.

1025
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,520
Airplane can go southward, northward… anywhere it wants to.

1026
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,240
Only the things that are in it

1027
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:45,760
are correlated with each other in such proportion

1028
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,760
that they cannot budge from their ideal positions.

1029
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,160
I’m giving this example because you are here.

1030
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,960
You’ll understand it better now.

1031
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,840
And these things that you have produced

1032
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,040
are themselves… are perfect.

1033
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,320
If they are imperfect, there will be a problem.

1034
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,360
It’s like that. If you understand

1035
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,840
this very simple thing about relations and attitudes,

1036
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,000
you will never have problems.

1037
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,120
Your relationship with a Sahaja Yogi

1038
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,080
has to be absolutely ideal relationship.

1039
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,360
Otherwise, some screw is loose.

1040
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,080
Try to make it ideal. Say, there’s one person.

1041
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,360
You find the person is too egoistical, or something.

1042
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,440
Try to see what’s wrong with you, first of all:

1043
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,520
“Am I perfect? Am I all right?

1044
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,880
Or am I equally dominating, am I equally egoistical?

1045
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,880
All right, if I am, then I better correct myself.

1046
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,320
But if I am not,

1047
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,240
if I am a good person, that way I’m not dominating —

1048
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,560
then I should try to bring down his ego

1049
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,880
by making sweet things to him, making nice relationship with him.”

1050
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,840
Try to be kind to him, so that his ego comes down.

1051
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,760
Manage somehow or other to establish ideal relationship.

1052
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,360
Is absolutely simple. I mean, I don’t understand

1053
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,960
what have I to tell in this thing. You know everything.

1054
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,520
That it has to be proper.

1055
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,560
Now see, the relationship between that and

1056
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,000
Me has to be proper, so that it doesn’t burn Me, isn’t it?

1057
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,280
It’s absolutely… in lifetime, also, we have to do the same thing —

1058
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:23,200
that relationship with each other has to be ideal

1059
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,600
to create the best results.

1060
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,400
It is so practical;

1061
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,200
I don’t know what is there to tell in this thing.

1062
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,880
And you have to be perfect because you are the unit.

1063
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,680
And the whole thing can be pragmatic.

1064
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,360
Then only it can be.

1065
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:47,080
But here just the other way round. The screws are pragmatic,

1066
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:52,360
the relationship is imperfect,

1067
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:00,040
and the collectivity is absolutely static. Doesn’t move.

1068
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,200
“The collectivity. After all, we are collective,

1069
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,080
bound to each other.

1070
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,000
How can we move, Mother, we are static now.

1071
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,000
We are bound to each other, we can’t move, you see.”

1072
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,800
Just like the Rock of Gibraltar.

1073
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:22,960
Now, you’ve been an aeronautic engineer, you should understand this

1074
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,000
better than anybody else, this example.

1075
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,760
What else is the question?

1076
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:43,840
How are you? All right? I’m asking.

1077
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,640
What other question?

1078
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,000
YOGI: Shri Mataji, could You say something about

1079
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,160
maintaining our attention, so that it stays where it should

1080
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,800
and doesn’t get diverted into trivial things?

1081
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,680
SHRI MATAJI: Rustem has asked a very practical question,

1082
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:12,160
it’s true — that to keep the attention where it should be.

1083
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,560
You see, for everything

1084
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,120
you have to do some exercise, abhyas.

1085
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,320
Not before Realization — after Realization.

1086
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,920
The best way is to learn how to watch yourself.

1087
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,520
Just now sitting here, just put yourself into a position

1088
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,240
from where you watch yourself: “Now what am I doing?”

1089
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,920
This is the abhyas, this is the study.

1090
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,000
Apart from mantras, apart from anything.

1091
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:51,880
The abhyas is the practice, practice of becoming a witness.

1092
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,200
And the witness is the Spirit state; then attention will not go.

1093
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,240
I mean, you will see everything, it’s there,

1094
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,560
but attention will be inside.

1095
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,320
Try to practice this: “Am I a witness?”

1096
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,360
Now, say, some people say, “Oh God, I had a horrible time.

1097
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,320
Mother, this happened, that happened.”

1098
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,160
You see, you are not a witness.

1099
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,120
How can you have a horrible time if you are the Spirit?

1100
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:21,440
You only have a horrible time when you are not the Spirit.

1101
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,640
If you can watch the whole thing as a drama that is played,

1102
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,640
then you are not having a horrible time,

1103
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,920
but this outside of you is having horrible time,

1104
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,560
which you are watching.

1105
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,880
That’s how the attention can be fixed very well

1106
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,600
if you practice abhyas,

1107
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,040
practice all the time to be witness.

1108
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,520
Say, you go out, you see something.

1109
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,040
Just try to see it, not to think about it.

1110
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,560
Be a witness of the whole thing. The joy will be complete,

1111
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,360
and, also, you will become absolutely peaceful.

1112
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,440
Your attention will be completely enlightened.

1113
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:06,200
And then the inspiration you will get will be tremendous.

1114
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,320
See, it’s working out. Working out. Try to watch.

1115
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,920
And it has such a tremendous memory — if you know how to watch.

1116
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,520
I mean, to Me, if I see something, I mean…

1117
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,920
to Me it’s just like a… film in My mind.

1118
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,960
If I have seen this room now, I know what’s it in this, design —

1119
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,440
everything I know. How you are sitting, what pose you have taken,

1120
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,800
how you wear, what was it — everything is like a design.

1121
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,680
You see, it comes to Me just like a picture. Absolutely.

1122
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,800
Not of this life but of lives!

1123
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,360
Because that’s a recording system; that records best.

1124
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,960
If there are thoughts, it’s like something in between, you see.

1125
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,640
Now he is trying to record Me on the film,

1126
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,760
and if there’s something in between, moving, nothing will come in.

1127
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,640
But when there is nothing in between

1128
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,360
and you are just seeing through,

1129
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,280
you are recording everything that is important.

1130
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,840
Moreover, you’ll be amazed, you don’t record unimportant things.

1131
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,320
Like for people now…

1132
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,040
they go to a village or any place;

1133
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,960
they will be recording: “Oh God, it was very dirty,

1134
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,680
and this happened, and we went there,

1135
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,120
and there was cement to sleep,” for example, “we get…”

1136
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,200
Or: “Then we went inside,

1137
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,440
and there was no proper chair to sit down,

1138
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,240
and the chair was so hard,

1139
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,240
and my back started aching” — all these things they will remember.

1140
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,160
And then what happened? “Oh God, I couldn’t get Realization…”

1141
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,600
Everything that bad.

1142
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,360
You see, it’s just like newspaper, all bad news.

1143
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,520
But to a person who is a realized soul in a real way…

1144
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,000
he doesn’t see; I mean, you don’t smell anything dirty,

1145
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,200
you always smell something good.

1146
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,120
You never smell, you do not think of anything dirty.

1147
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,040
Everywhere you go is beautiful.

1148
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,280
Even if you see just a sand, you see the pattern.

1149
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,440
Even if you see a barren hill.

1150
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,520
I saw some people who had gone;

1151
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,960
I said, “Look at the beauty of these hills in Maharashtra.”

1152
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,640
They said, “Mother, what is the beauty?

1153
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,600
It’s not covered with trees.”

1154
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,440
I said, “That’s the beauty, just see it, the patterns.”

1155
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,720
They couldn’t see the patterns that I was seeing.

1156
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,240
But if you ask Me what is this hill, I also know that.

1157
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
Because I know the patterns of all the hills —

1158
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:47,720
how it has moved, how it has made patterns and things like that.

1159
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,080
Because they don’t see that. You see, they cannot see the beauty,

1160
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,440
because they are looking out for defects.

1161
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,520
Or, relatively, you see: “English trees are better

1162
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,320
than, say, XYZ trees.”

1163
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,600
So, then — “This is not better.” The relative… they start.

1164
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,160
But you are at absolute point,

1165
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:11,000
you are getting the absolute of everything. Everything is your own.

1166
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,920
What is there to judge?

1167
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,640
YOGI: Mother, perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.

1168
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,480
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

1169
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,920
YOGI: Perhaps You can see the beauty because You are the Artist.

1170
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,680
SHRI MATAJI: I am the Artist and I am the Art.

1171
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,960
But what about you? Who are you?

1172
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,360
You are the… you are the one who is created,

1173
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,000
and you can create, and you can become the artist.

1174
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:33,240
That’s what I’m saying — that you are not only the light

1175
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,720
but the light that will give light to others.

1176
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:39,520
And, also, you will sustain that light which you have given light.

1177
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,640
This is the difference now between you and other people.

1178
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,160
Not that only you will be an artist

1179
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,880
but you’ll enjoy the art of the Artist.

1180
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,360
This is what you have got.

1181
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,080
You don’t know, you are not aware of your powers.

1182
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,960
It’s a dynamic thing which has happened to you,

1183
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,440
which you should take to.

1184
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,360
But our attention is on from where the dirt is coming,

1185
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,160
where the filth is coming, you know;

1186
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:10,680
where the ugliness is there.

1187
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,160
If your attention is on ugliness…

1188
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,440
People tell Me, “There was this [UNCLEAR].” I didn’t see,

1189
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,840
I just saw the way the elephant was standing, you see;

1190
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,040
the way he has pulled up his leg and he was raising his trunk.

1191
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,440
I never saw the dirt part of it. “Where was it?”

1192
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,840
“At the back of it.” I say, “I never went on the back.”

1193
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,000
If your attention is on… even description of a person.

1194
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,040
You ask a person, “How is he?”

1195
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,040
“He’s a…”

1196
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:41,280
All his… I mean, little funny points will come to your head.

1197
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,600
Even the photographers, I’ve seen.

1198
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,000
They will only take photograph when you are in a funny way, you see;

1199
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,080
when your face is little turned round…

1200
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,680
I mean, it’s a seeking after ugliness,

1201
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,080
seeking after mistakes, seeking after something wrong.

1202
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,040
All the time if you do like this, you cannot be a happy person.

1203
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,720
All the time trying to find out defects,

1204
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:06,960
and faults, and mistakes, and dirt, and ugliness.

1205
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:13,040
I mean, you are in for trouble. You’re asking for it.

1206
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,240
Like a person was saying there are three-four ditches in this place.

1207
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,160
I said, “Did you jump into one of them? Better jump in.

1208
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,320
So, once for all, you don’t see any other ditch.”

1209
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,120
You don’t see the playing grounds,

1210
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,880
you are just seeing the ditches. For what?!

1211
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,200
The same thing can look ugly to a person

1212
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,240
who is of that kind of an attitude,

1213
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,680
who wants to see everything ugly.

1214
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,760
Try your attitudes. Try to see good in others.

1215
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,760
Try to see… not in… may not be… it…

1216
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,480
I’m not saying for other people,

1217
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,200
but I’m saying at least for Sahaja Yogis you can do it.

1218
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,880
Try to see good in them; what good they have done to Sahaja Yoga,

1219
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,760
what you owe to them, how to get along with them.

1220
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,000
Why not see the good of them?

1221
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,200
By giving them encouragement, by being good to them

1222
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,680
you are helping Sahaja Yoga.

1223
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,800
But you want to help your ego, because you are very “wise”.

1224
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,600
So, then only, when by appreciating another person only,

1225
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,440
you have better relationship. This is a very simple fact.

1226
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,480
You see any film — there the two people are talking to each other

1227
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,560
as if they are barking at each other.

1228
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,840
What does it take to be kind, to be gentle, to say pleasant things?

1229
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,200
As soon as they will see a person — “Oh God!

1230
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:45,520
You have become very ugly!” This is the best compliment.

1231
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,040
That’s human nature —

1232
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,440
to see to the faults of others,

1233
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,280
to see to the wrong things of others.

1234
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,720
You see, they will find out in anything.

1235
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,240
Somebody is very tidy — then that person is bad.

1236
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,480
Somebody is very untidy — that person is bad. Every sort of thing.

1237
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,520
But why not you do something about yourself,

1238
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,880
that there’s something inside you which is not tidy?

1239
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,440
And inside you that’s very upsetting.

1240
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,960
To Me it makes no difference, you have seen it.

1241
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,480
It makes no difference. If you say, I’ll sleep here.

1242
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:22,240
If you say, I’ll sleep on the… on the grass there.

1243
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,920
To Me makes no difference to what bathroom I go…

1244
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,560
I don’t even remember all those things.

1245
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,640
What is there to remember in a bathroom, and this, and that?

1246
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,720
All nonsense it is. I have no memory for all these things.

1247
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,200
Even if you want Me to know, I will not remember.

1248
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,440
If you ask Me, “How did you go to that bathroom?” —

1249
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,320
“Which one?” “That one.” I said, “It’s all right, I’ve been there.”

1250
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,760
Then food. “What sort of a taste it was?”

1251
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,320
and “What food it was?” and…

1252
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,120
all sorts of things people go on thinking a lot.

1253
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:53,720
What’s the use? The whole food is going to just be digested

1254
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,440
in the same stomach.

1255
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,640
What is there to be so much worried about all these things?

1256
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,280
We are wasting our energy. I don’t waste My energy.

1257
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,760
I have no energy for wasting.

1258
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,520
In the same way, why do you waste your energy?

1259
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,960
Why not see to the better side of man?

1260
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,000
By seeing bad side, if you can cure it — well and good.

1261
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,280
But if you cannot cure it, you are going to get yourself bad.

1262
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,920
If you can cure it — nothing like it. But you can’t.

1263
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,960
Also once… always person say, “I would not do that.”

1264
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:36,360
But you would do something else that the other person would not do.

1265
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,600
When judging others,

1266
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,080
one has to know one should judge oneself first of all.

1267
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,120
Because with what are you judging? With your ego or superego.

1268
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,280
I’ve seen, it’s a very common failing,

1269
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,120
which should not be there any more.

1270
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,000
Now you are realized souls, you are saints. And the saints…

1271
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,760
though olden saints might be doing whatever they did — forget them.

1272
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,160
But you people are not going to see the faults of each other

1273
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,880
but to the good points of everyone.

1274
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,360
Simple things I’ve seen:

1275
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,880
somebody says a wrong English word, or a Sanskrit word,

1276
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,800
or a wrong this — immediately you will catch on that.

1277
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,640
But he gives a big lecture — it’s all right. That nobody listens.

1278
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,560
Your mind is working: “What wrong thing he’s going to say?”

1279
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:37,480
Attention should be onto what he said, it’s so beautiful.

1280
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,280
And then you will develop an attitude — as Mine is —

1281
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:47,520
you’ll never see to the defects of the place. Never.

1282
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,280
Never. [UNCLEAR]. You will have no eyes to see.

1283
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,280
I mean, Mine is like that, condition is like that, I tell you.

1284
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,200
It will be like that. It’s very difficult.

1285
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,200
Like somebody says, “You come and play those cards with sticks” —

1286
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,680
I never remember. I’ll always lose.

1287
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,120
So I said, “What’s the use of play it? I don’t remember.”

1288
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,720
See, everybody says, “You have so many brains otherwise,

1289
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,320
can’t you remember these three cards?”

1290
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:15,360
I can’t, I can’t. It’s just My brain goes off.

1291
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,160
I put automa… I don’t know.

1292
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,680
I look like a stupid fool when I play that game.

1293
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,360
So why should I play?

1294
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,360
Anything like that — I am absolutely good for nothing.

1295
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,800
So it’s a thing people know: “Oh, she is useless. Forget her.”

1296
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,320
But it should become automatic with you also.

1297
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,200
Then it’s so enjoyable: how beautiful we are,

1298
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,920
that everything is so beautiful around us to see.

1299
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,360
Such beauty exists and we do not see it!

1300
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,160
Such tremendous joy! Every bliss is there flowing within us.

1301
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,280
And we don’t know, we don’t notice it. It’s such a happy thing.

1302
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,520
It’s such a beautiful thing.

1303
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,400
“Oh God, such a source of joy!” —

1304
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,720
was just standing next to Me. I never knew.

1305
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,480
And just I turned round and saw that force. Turn round!

1306
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,520
Turn your back to all conditionings of yours,

1307
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,600
the ideas that you have…

1308
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,080
Do not pass judgement, first thing is.

1309
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:23,080
Great art critics and all that, please, I beg of you,

1310
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:29,200
that do not pass remarks at anything all the time.

1311
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,480
Is ego playing the trick.

1312
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:36,200
Just watch it, how it is making you feel

1313
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,960
that you are something very great. Be careful.

1314
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,280
There were some people coming from America, have they come?

1315
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,560
YOGINI: Steve and Christine, they called to say…

1316
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,480
SHRI MATAJI: They haven’t come.

1317
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,440
YOGINI: They’re coming in one week. One more week they’re coming.

1318
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,800
SHRI MATAJI: So then we’ll decide, when they come here,

1319
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,040
what is to be done.

1320
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,040
Linda, for your problem, what is the thing to be done?

1321
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,720
Will you get out of your personal problems or not?

1322
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,880
YOGINI: Yes, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: No, I’m talking to Linda now.

1323
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,600
YOGINI: I’m… Which Linda?

1324
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,120
[UNCLEAR].

1325
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,560
SHRI MATAJI: I would suggest you should stay with your mother.

1326
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,120
She needs you. She’s an old woman, she needs you.

1327
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,560
You must serve her. There’s nothing wrong in it.

1328
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,840
YOGINI: Very possessive.

1329
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,280
SHRI MATAJI: No no no. You are inadequate,

1330
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,920
not that she is inadequate.

1331
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,880
You have to serve her. Give her love, affection.

1332
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,240
She is lonely. She behaves like that because she is lonely.

1333
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,040
You are inadequate; I won’t say to her anything.

1334
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:59,080
She needs… she never had love, and you are the only child she has.

1335
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,880
You should love her. Give her more love, more affection.

1336
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,120
And, also, what she says about Peter, you should do that.

1337
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,520
Will give her consolation. She’s going crazy because of that.

1338
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,920
YOGINI: Trouble is, Mother, she said,

1339
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,760
“It’s like ten years doing Sahaja Yoga.”

1340
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,160
SHRI MATAJI: Let her say. Her saying nothing matters.

1341
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,760
You see, that’s not the thing, that’s just an escape.

1342
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,720
Because you are crazy, that’s why she thinks like that.

1343
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,160
YOGINI: I know that. I don’t blame, of course.

1344
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,880
SHRI MATAJI: But you should establish yourself

1345
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,160
with more patience, with more love and affection.

1346
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,840
She’d say, “Do hundred times Sahaja Yoga.”

1347
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,400
How much she’s changed her attitude —

1348
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,360
because when you went there you went crazy.

1349
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,040
And you are quite crazy sometimes, I’ve seen.

1350
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,040
First of all, you must be a tidy person,

1351
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,280
neat person; must look after her.

1352
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,920
You must take up her responsibility of looking after.

1353
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,760
She’s an old woman, who has had no love all her life.

1354
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,560
What she wants is love,

1355
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,360
and as a child, daughter, you must give her love.

1356
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,960
Whatever she is. You can’t leave her alone.

1357
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,120
If you give her love, I’m sure you can cure her.

1358
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,320
You take up… it, take it up as a challenge.

1359
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,680
And give her a bandhan; everybody can give her a bandhan.

1360
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,640
And put her right. You cannot be helpless like that.

1361
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,720
To run away from your duties towards your mother,

1362
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,800
I will never allow you.

1363
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,320
You can go to Cheltenham, start a centre there,

1364
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,440
attend it, do it. You have to.

1365
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:25,880
YOGINI: Do you want me actually live with her?

1366
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,520
YOGI: Should she live with her mother?

1367
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, of course. Why not?

1368
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,320
She is your own mother. She’s not such a cruel woman.

1369
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,880
I don’t think so. I have seen her.

1370
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,800
But you get crazy yourself, I know. I know that.

1371
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,920
This is how you will test yourself.

1372
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,960
You should live with her. After all, she’s so old now.

1373
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,480
What’s her age?

1374
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,480
YOGINI: Sixty-four… sixty-three.

1375
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,280
SHRI MATAJI: See now. At sixty-three,

1376
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:00,400
if she’s left alone in that house, what will she do?

1377
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,680
You tell her that “I’ve decided

1378
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,000
to do what you have told me about Peter…”

1379
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,320
YOGINI: She hasn’t really tell me anything about Peter;

1380
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,360
I’ve been doing most of the telling.

1381
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,400
SHRI MATAJI: All right, whatever it is. She’ll be all right.

1382
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,240
You see, you try to tell her these things —

1383
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,720
she’ll be all right. You tell her.

1384
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,280
Just like this: “And now I’m going to look after you.

1385
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,040
You are very sick. You are not well.”

1386
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:31,920
Take care. Did you talk to her kindly sometimes?

1387
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,120
YOGINI: Well, I tried.

1388
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,520
SHRI MATAJI: No, you did not.

1389
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,800
You did not, that’s what it is.

1390
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,080
As a Sahaja Yogi, you have to be extremely kind

1391
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,680
and compassionate towards her.

1392
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,840
She’s an old woman, had no love from her husband…

1393
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,880
She has tried to do something for you always.

1394
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,440
So, as a daughter, you have a duty.

1395
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,920
YOGINI: I’m very worried about Bumble

1396
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,240
because it’s a sort of 3-cornered arrangement which comes out.

1397
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,720
SHRI MATAJI: What happens about Bumble?

1398
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,880
YOGINI: Well, Bumble sort of finishes up

1399
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,280
in between me and her. It’s…

1400
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,440
SHRI MATAJI: But if you finish off from yourself,

1401
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,760
she won’t be finishing off like that.

1402
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,360
See, why do you create a problem between you and her, first of all?

1403
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,560
There should be no gap.

1404
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,640
If there is no gap, then there won’t be any problem.

1405
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,360
The problem is because you are a problem and she is a problem,

1406
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,720
so the child suffers.

1407
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,000
But if you just have nothing, you… if she tells…

1408
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,200
on the contrary, if a child tells anything about your mother,

1409
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,160
you should say, “Don’t say like that to my… she is my mother.”

1410
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:37,000
Tomorrow she will turn back and tell you that, take it from Me.

1411
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:41,000
She is much more sensible in this than you are.

1412
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,080
You should not tell her anything about your mother.

1413
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,160
You should say, “She has been very kind to me and nice to me.”

1414
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,960
If it is communicated to her — if through Bumble —

1415
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,880
things will be all right.

1416
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,480
See, how long is she going to live

1417
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:59,280
with this kind of life she has had. All right?

1418
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,840
Where are you going to try your Sahaja Yoga

1419
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,160
if you can’t try on your own mother?

1420
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,760
YOGINI: She wouldn’t have it.

1421
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,520
SHRI MATAJI: No, that’s not the way. It’s not outside, it is inside.

1422
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,560
YOGINI: I try to cook for her and she won’t eat what I cook.

1423
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,000
SHRI MATAJI: You don’t have to do it outside,

1424
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,080
you have to do it inside with her.

1425
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,360
Be kind, be gentle, be of service.

1426
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,440
At the most, she’ll shout sometimes, doesn’t matter.

1427
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,680
Forgive her. Forgive her.

1428
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,720
YOGINI: She has vomiting, which really worries me.

1429
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,960
She doesn’t sleep at night.

1430
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,000
She wanders around talking to herself for whole time.

1431
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,160
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it’s all right,

1432
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,680
if she doesn’t sleep, then you can say some mantras in your heart.

1433
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,040
You know there’s a mantra of Nidra and all that.

1434
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,520
You put her left to the right — she’ll sleep off.

1435
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:47,080
You do it, all that. She’ll sleep. You should say that “Breathe in,

1436
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,840
three times, heavily. You’ll sleep off.”

1437
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,160
And if you… when she’s talking also, if you sleep off,

1438
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,520
she is not going to wake you up again.

1439
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,520
You just doze off there, and she’ll say,

1440
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:00,800
“All right, you go and sleep now,” formally.

1441
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,840
It’s very simple to fight out this thing.

1442
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,240
I mean, she needs you very much. She can’t sleep, just imagine.

1443
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,080
Your mother can’t sleep, how can you run away from her?

1444
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,360
Just see her condition. She is your mother.

1445
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,440
YOGINI: She is in a terrible state.

1446
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,320
SHRI MATAJI: Then how can you leave her? You can’t.

1447
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,960
Can’t leave her. No, I wouldn’t say that.

1448
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,120
You can’t leave your mother.

1449
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,960
You know, Kathy wanted to come with Me. You remember Kathy?

1450
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,720
YOGINI: Yes, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: When I told her,

1451
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,640
“You can’t leave your mother in the hospital,

1452
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,800
come with Me to India. No, you can’t.”

1453
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,680
She missed that [THING?] completely.

1454
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,920
I told her, “You stay with your mother.” She is here. Just ask her.

1455
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,720
I did tell her.

1456
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,800
And she was cancer, this thing, with the Sahaja Yoga and all that,

1457
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,520
and she used to attend to her. She stayed back.

1458
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,840
No, you can’t leave your parents like that, you see.

1459
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,440
Parents are very important things after certain age.

1460
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,960
You have to look after them.

1461
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,560
Whatever they are. You must look after your parents,

1462
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,920
that’s very important in Sahaja Yoga.

1463
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,560
Your Right Heart cannot be all right, Shri Rama cannot be all right

1464
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,760
if you don’t look after your mother.

1465
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,120
She is not such a bad woman. I’ve seen her.

1466
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,120
And if she was a very cruel, horrible, this sort of thing,

1467
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,880
then I would have said, “All right, forget her.”

1468
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,120
But she is not that way. She is not either so much…

1469
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,840
She is drinking because she has no company;

1470
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,600
she doesn’t know what to do with herself.

1471
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,600
So she is trying to run away from herself.

1472
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:37,440
Is very simple to understand. You be kind and gentle.

1473
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,360
Give her some value, that she is something to you.

1474
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,600
She’ll be all right.

1475
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,080
I’ve seen, she is not a bad woman.

1476
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,280
Lot of her sense comes into you also, her goodness.

1477
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,880
YOGINI: I’m bothered, I think, by… when Grazyna came to stay,

1478
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,800
she felt… Grazyna felt that…

1479
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,680
she had this brother, you see, who [UNCLEAR]…

1480
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,560
he killed himself [MOTOR-RACING?].

1481
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,160
She saw him die in front of her.

1482
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,160
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

1483
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,760
YOGINI: And she had this brother, my mother,

1484
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,880
who she loved very much. And he…

1485
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,480
SHRI MATAJI: That I’ve heard of already; that story I know.

1486
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,520
Whatever she has done, whatever it is.

1487
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,720
YOGINI: She seems very [UNCLEAR].

1488
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,120
SHRI MATAJI: Doesn’t matter. But by leaving her,

1489
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,600
are you going to help her by that?

1490
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,160
You should fill the position of that brother.

1491
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,440
You should say, “Doesn’t matter. If the brother has died,

1492
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,360
I am here to look after you, mother.”

1493
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,080
Why is she hankering after the brother?

1494
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,120
She thinks that if the brother had lived,

1495
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,760
he would look after her in old age.

1496
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,120
But God knows if he had look after; he would run away too.

1497
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:38,440
Why can’t you fill the place of the brother? You can. Why not?

1498
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,480
You take it up upon yourself. You can do it, I know.

1499
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:47,360
All right? You look upon her as you look upon Me.

1500
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:55,120
Why not? Just try. It is worth it. It’s worth it.

1501
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,800
Be nice and gentle. Say nice things, pleasant things to her.

1502
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Show interest in her life.

1503
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,160
Actually, you see, all this has come from the psychologists also.

1504
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,880
Horrible ones.

1505
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,480
No, they always suggest their mother did something.

1506
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,520
Everybody I saw, they said, “My mother is like…”

1507
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,600
I said, “How can everybody’s mother be so cruel?

1508
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,960
Could be some people’s but not everybody’s.”

1509
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,600
And, also, if they have deviated from right path,

1510
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,680
it is because they never got their love.

1511
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,880
They never got their place in life.

1512
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,880
See, the husbands must have ill-treated them, tortured their lives,

1513
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,520
and must have been after them; or maybe they had some other problems

1514
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,880
from their parents, or something. Everybody’s mother has tortured…

1515
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,680
It’s a psychology, I think. That way, mother is, in a way…

1516
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,160
always if you look at her from a wrong angle,

1517
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,520
she will look like your enemy.

1518
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:09,480
In the West, the mother picture is horrible.

1519
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,960
Also wars, things have come in that generation;

1520
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,160
people have been shattered of their values.

1521
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,320
All you must understand what kind of life

1522
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,520
this horrible Western society can give to women who are good.

1523
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,080
Good women are really tortured in this society.

1524
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,920
Only the smart ones and the ones who are very arrogant

1525
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,040
and who know how to put men right

1526
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,440
and women right in their places can exist.

1527
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,440
You see, this is what it is. It’s a regular struggle here.

1528
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,400
Any good woman is tortured in this society.

1529
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,760
I mean, if she exists and she really lives,

1530
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:53,560
it’s something surprising. Ask, Maria will tell you. You ask her.

1531
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,520
How they put them down, how they insult them, how…

1532
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,200
I mean, everybody has seen this happening here.

1533
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,360
But don’t blame the mother all the time.

1534
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,280
At this stage you must look after. So, now what is next?

1535
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,480
YOGI: Sorry, could you marry me and my girlfriend

1536
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,080
some time in future, do You think?

1537
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,280
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

1538
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,520
YOGI: Marry him and his girlfriend.

1539
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,280
SHRI MATAJI: Who is your girlfriend?

1540
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,360
YOGI: She is not here tonight, she is in…

1541
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:28,760
SHRI MATAJI: She is not a Sahaja Yogini?

1542
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,960
YOGI: She’s come from Bedford. Yes, she is a Sahaja Yogini.

1543
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,960
SHRI MATAJI: She’s Sahaja Yogini.

1544
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,320
So you want to have a marriage on Krishnashtami?

1545
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,320
Some of the marriage to be performed?

1546
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,640
YOGI: [YES, PLEASE].

1547
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,240
SHRI MATAJI: Now, when is the Krishnashtami?

1548
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,480
YOGI: Next Sunday, Mother.

1549
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,120
YOGI: Some time in the future, not…

1550
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,120
SHRI MATAJI: You see, the best place to get married is in India.

1551
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,840
Very easy, and you have a real feeling

1552
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,440
because you come on a horse, and this and that, you see.

1553
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:18,480
But even if you want to have in Krishnashtami day,

1554
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:21,040
I don’t know if we can get really somebody to do it.

1555
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:24,360
If somebody we can get, we should do it.

1556
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,480
There are people who want to get married.

1557
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,960
But, you see, Sahaja Yoga marriage is taken for granted.

1558
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,960
I’ve seen, people do not have that understanding.

1559
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:36,960
And it’s very dangerous to play with it, very dangerous. See?

1560
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,760
So, I think, if you have some time given to yourself,

1561
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,520
I will definitely marry.

1562
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:44,960
Best thing is, I think, let people take some time

1563
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,520
and decide, because…

1564
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,960
you see, it’s very funny, nobody feels responsible about it.

1565
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,280
They’ll come out with an explanation:

1566
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:56,600
“Oh, I didn’t understand, and I was not in a position to do it;

1567
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:02,080
I was still possessed with a bhoot. And I married another bhoot.”

1568
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:16,080
YOGI: [UNCLEAR], I’ve lived with her for two years.

1569
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,200
SHRI MATAJI: With her?

1570
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,080
YOGI: Yes, with her.

1571
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,280
SHRI MATAJI: That is, you have given sufficient time now?

1572
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,920
But, you see, one thing is:

1573
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,680
their living in the West is simple… people.

1574
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,720
But if you tell them, “Marriage” — Oh God! They go… go amok.

1575
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:34,520
They go amok. You see, if it’s a marriage — aah!

1576
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:37,720
Ask David Prole, he’ll tell you.

1577
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,160
You see, because the law is so horrifyingly funny here,

1578
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,080
marriage — Oh God, it means horrible things.

1579
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,800
You have to separate, you have to…

1580
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,920
if you have to divorce… the first thing about divorce:

1581
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,120
“You’ll have to give so much money”,

1582
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,080
“Half money the wife will take away”, “She’ll murder me…”

1583
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,280
You see, they show “husband murders wife,

1584
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:02,120
wife murders husband” — all sorts of things, you know.

1585
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,120
All the time it is like going on in this country —

1586
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,440
is madness about marriage.

1587
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,920
So, I think is a good idea.

1588
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,680
I would like — if you can arrange —

1589
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,320
because Krishnashtami is a good time to marry people.

1590
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:19,040
Our sixteen marriages, which one has failed?

1591
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,520
Last time?

1592
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:25,920
For the sixteen… no, sixteen here, in London.

1593
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,960
Who were the sixteen people, let’s see.

1594
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:37,840
All first class. All first class, yeah.

1595
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:42,920
Yeah. Good.

1596
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:48,760
So, for next marriage lot…

1597
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,040
Some will be lucky in behind like Nick; I would like him to marry.

1598
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:00,880
Now you are not so frightened, are you? Nick? No. It’s good.

1599
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,280
[PHRASE IN HINDI]

1600
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,040
On the Dashera day we can have marriage.

1601
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,080
Dussehra day. That’s another day one can marry.

1602
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,600
Now, Krishnashtami and Dussehra day… of course, after the Diwali,

1603
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,200
after the marriage of the Tulasi —

1604
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:27,920
then only people start, but Dussehra day is very very good,

1605
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,640
it’s very auspicious. [PHRASE IN HINDI].

1606
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,840
So we’ll have marriages on Dashera day.

1607
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,720
Till then, prepare people for marriage.

1608
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:43,960
All right? Dashera will be, say, about…

1609
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,160
End of October. About. All right?

1610
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,560
YOGI: Yes, lovely, thank you.

1611
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,520
SHRI MATAJI: Let’s find out where will I be.

1612
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:03,720
So, that’s how.

1613
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:07,200
YOGI: Mother, I was going to ask that…

1614
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,720
some Sahaja Yogis who’ve been in Sahaja Yoga for a long time

1615
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,200
don’t feel cool breeze; they don’t feel any catches.

1616
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:15,920
Some people feel burning all the time;

1617
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,480
some people feel these things in their head,

1618
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,680
in their body, toes, hands.

1619
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,640
It’s the way we’re gonna develop,

1620
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,320
where you can feel things — all of us, all over —

1621
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,440
or is it just some people feel different things?

1622
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,160
SHRI MATAJI: No no. You see, to begin with,

1623
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,320
you see, it has something to do with your nervous system. All right?

1624
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,120
So, if your nervous system is disturbed, you may not feel, at all.

1625
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,840
For the nervous system, best thing is to do massage.

1626
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,640
You see, somebody should massage their back, hands…

1627
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,280
Also, I’ve told many a times that you rub your hands

1628
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,840
with vibrated olive oil, quite a lot,

1629
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,320
and rub these things, so they become sensitive.

1630
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,200
Could be with insensitivity.

1631
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,760
But if they can feel the catches in the body,

1632
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,680
that means they are all right, only the Vishuddhi is not all right.

1633
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:07,280
Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi, work on Vishuddhi, clear it out.

1634
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,560
And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say,

1635
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,880
butter to rub on the… here,

1636
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,880
and rub all these muscles, you see, with that.

1637
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,120
All these things will work out, for your hand.

1638
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,960
But supposing you are… there’s no cool breeze

1639
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,080
coming out of the head, possibly.

1640
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,600
Then the Realization yet not has established.

1641
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,120
See, other people should say whether there is a cool breeze coming,

1642
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,320
because the person who is not realized may not feel it.

1643
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,960
Supposing he does not feel it, and you feel it,

1644
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,720
then he is realized; only thing, his chakras are to be cleared out.

1645
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:37,920
It’s a different different category of people.

1646
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,200
Then, there are some people whose Kundalini has not risen;

1647
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,760
they are still Sahaja Yogis. Like that.

1648
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,240
Maybe. I don’t know if there are any.

1649
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:48,000
Those people who are unmarried for long,

1650
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,080
they are very difficult people because they never feel

1651
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,440
the cool breeze in the hand, quite a lot. Like that.

1652
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:56,120
But it is not so. They are realized souls in any case.

1653
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,560
They may not feel it, but they are realized souls, you see.

1654
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,600
Because a kind of a softness, a kind of a balance

1655
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,440
is developed after marriage — which is not there.

1656
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:07,280
And that’s how some people don’t feel it.

1657
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,880
There are various reasons.

1658
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,480
Some people who are ego-oriented more —

1659
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,200
they should turn their left to the right many a times.

1660
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,400
They should find out… from the hands, you see.

1661
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,560
One hand is bigger, one hand is smaller.

1662
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,760
That means the left hand — if it is smaller —

1663
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,840
that means you have to raise left to the right.

1664
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,600
You see, from the size of the hands and all that you can see it.

1665
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,520
Putting one hand towards the photograph, another hand outside…

1666
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,280
Work it out in so many ways,

1667
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,000
because you have permutations and combinations of certain mistakes.

1668
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,800
But that doesn’t mean you develop this Left Vishuddhi by any chance.

1669
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,880
Because that’s the worst thing that can happen.

1670
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,200
If you develop the Left Vishuddhi,

1671
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,000
then it’s a very difficult situation for you.

1672
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:51,680
Now, for this kind of a thing,

1673
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,640
I think I’ll give you a complete lecture on one day.

1674
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,560
Complete. As to see what permutations and combinations

1675
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:03,680
of different chakras can create. All right?

1676
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,440
But symptoms are outside.

1677
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:11,200
The symptoms are mostly outside; there’s no need to…

1678
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:15,680
from a personality you can see what it is he is catching, you see.

1679
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:21,600
Is a very… problem, great problem with people,

1680
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,600
that they don’t feel the vibrations; some people just don’t feel it.

1681
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,480
How many there are like that, who never feel any vibrations?

1682
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,000
Never felt, never… raise you hand. I know, Kerry.

1683
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,040
YOGI: Not never.

1684
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,920
SHRI MATAJI: And you never… you have felt it sometime. All right.

1685
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:41,000
YOGI: Mother, since I came to the ashram I’ve been…

1686
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,640
my hands have been very hot all the time.

1687
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,160
SHRI MATAJI: Which way? YOGI: But I feel the catches inside.

1688
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,000
SHRI MATAJI: Both the hands are?

1689
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,440

That was a good answer.

1856
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:34,360
So he can go somewhere else

1857
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:38,360
if he says,”It’s not that I get attached to Spain.”

1858
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:40,680
Let’s see. But you better grow now.

1859
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,160
Did he tell you what is the problem is?

1860
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:46,760
And must learn proper English, you see?

1861
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,840
That’s very important because Sahaja Yoga…

1862
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:51,600
I cannot speak all the languages. So better try to learn.

1863
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:53,760
In here, people should teach English

1864
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:55,800
to people who don’t know good English, all right?

1865
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,920
Not that English language is God’s language,

1866
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,360
but at least I understand it.

1867
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,920
Otherwise, all the English will have [A BIG EGO?].

1868
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,720
And I can’t learn so many languages, all right?

1869
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:13,840
Try to learn English language

1870
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,360
and, also, understand Sahaja Yoga mentally.

1871
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:18,080
That’s important.

1872
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,240
Because you have to explain to people, talk to them.

1873
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:23,640
Because you talk, but it makes no sense on the other people

1874
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:25,800
if you have not mentally equipped.

1875
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,120
Those who are just attached to Sahaja Yoga with heart

1876
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:32,120
must equip themselves also with mind,

1877
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:35,360
must understand Sahaja Yoga with mind, is very important.

1878
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,360
And those who only understand with mind

1879
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:42,200
should understand it with heart. All right?

1880
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,880
YOGINI: To reading “The Advent”, Mother,

1881
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:48,160
is very useful, very helpful to overcome this problem,

1882
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:49,360
because I had the same problems.

1883
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:51,480
SHRI MATAJI: All right. Try to read “Advent”, explain to her,

1884
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:57,240
let her understand. How are you? You never came to the…

1885
01:56:57,480 --> 01:57:00,320
YOGI: Unfortunately, I had to work.
SHRI MATAJI: I see.

1886
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:02,600
YOGI: But I [FORGET TO LET YOU KNOW?].

1887
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,560
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

1888
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:08,760
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI]

[UNCLEAR] mangalsutra?

1890
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,680
You got two? One will sufficient,

1891
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:18,880
one you keep it for the next puja.

1892

[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS WITH A SAHAJA YOGI IN HINDI]

1893
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:53,560
You must get one made in gold.

1894
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,600
When I go to India, I’ll get you one.

1895
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,720
It should be used for puja.

1897
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:08,560
And the same can be used every time.

1898
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,440
May God bless you.

1899
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:11,840
YOGI: Mother, please forgive us

1900
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,480
for any mistakes we’ve made during Your puja.

1901
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,320
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you.

1902
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,760
Make a list now, and get it verified sometimes.

1903
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,880
And make a complete list, you see;

1904
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,840
so whenever you go there, try to remember.

1905
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:28,960
You keep one ready. Otherwise, don’t ask for it.

1906
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,880
Because it goes little funny there, isn’t it?

1907
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,200
Doesn’t look all right. Because you are such matured Sahaja Yogis.

1908
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,360
It is all right for children to make mistakes,

1909
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:41,160
but you are all matured people, so — doesn’t look nice.

1910
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:43,920
May God bless you.

1911

YOGINI: Mother, for Hampstead

1912
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,440
we do not know so much the protocol of pujas

1913
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:51,760
and how to… to behave in…

1914
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,560
there is no [ASPECTS TOWARDS YOU?].

1915
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:58,440
Then, how do You suggest we should educate ourselves?

01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:05,240
Because requires a real one big lecture, Maria.

Food is being brought, Mother.

They are all at home. I’m sorry, I have to go.
