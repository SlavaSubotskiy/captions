1
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:16,128
The organizers and the members of the Medical
Association in Sholapur, its such a pleasure

2
00:36:21,676 --> 00:36:27,403
to talk to (* inaudible text) because you
have also heard that I did some medicine.

3
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:30,311
Just to talk to doctors about it.

4
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:39,302
Because in the realm of the divine, there
are no names given to any plexuses.

5
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:46,251
It’s difficult to talk to doctors unless
and until you know their language.

6
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:59,350
Now the main thing we have to understand about
Sahaja yogi is this that when we are trying

7
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:09,061
to analyze or find out through scientific
methods anything, we can only do it when that

8
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:16,371
part is available to us, apparent to us, that
we can see it, we can feel it, we can analyze

9
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:17,371
it.

10
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:21,501
Like a tree, we see the tree on top of the
Mother Earth.

11
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:25,181
For us it is easy to see the tree.

12
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:32,100
But supposing we have to go deep down into
the roots.

13
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,181
So Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots
and not of the tree.

14
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:41,240
Of Course, the tree is very important because
root has no meaning if there is no tree.

15
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:50,861
But tree is more important when it can tell
you that there are roots to it.

16
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:57,761
So all our knowledge of science whatever it
is, whatever discoveries we have made, how

17
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:58,761
far we have gone?

18
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,451
I mean we can go very deep into it, I know
that.

19
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,721
But still, you can not reach the absolute.

20
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:10,851
Because “absolute” is that point where
you have to dissolve.

21
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:18,311
We have one scholar here, who is doing his
P.H.D from Brighton and he has a subject how

22
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:22,821
to establish an absolute zero point in temperature.

23
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:24,571
You can not.

24
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,821
Nobody can.

25
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,701
Its a fact.

26
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:32,491
You can go up to a point but you can not become
the absolute.

27
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:38,021
Through your mental projection because the
mind is a limited thing.

28
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,550
We must understand the mind is limited.

29
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,311
Like I came by car, I had to leave my car
behind to come inside.

30
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:49,871
In the same way this limited mind can not
take you to something that is unlimited.

31
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:52,190
Because absolute has to be unlimited.

32
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:57,121
So to reach the absolute point what should
be done.

33
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,621
That’s the main problem with all of us.

34
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:07,220
All those who are seekers, whether they are
scientists or psychologists or anyway.

35
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,610
They have one point if they see correctly
that we have not reached the absolute.

36
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:18,421
That is why we do not understand “why are
we made human beings from amoeba state?”

37
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:22,651
We should ask ourselves a simple question,”why
are we human beings?

38
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:28,741
What was the purpose of this evolution that
we were made human beings?

39
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:34,580
So, as we can’t answer this question it
is not answerable.

40
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:42,750
We have to know that we are in a transition
state and this human awareness has to achieve

41
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:50,000
another awareness which is dynamic, which
is collective in nature and many people I

42
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,181
would say like you, who has talked of collectivity.

43
00:39:54,181 --> 00:40:04,791
Who has talked of collective awareness that
a man, if he evolves, will become a collectively

44
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:05,791
conscious.

45
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:09,731
He could see that but he did not know how.

46
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:14,641
Even if you have to say that if you have to
go to Sholapur you better take this road or

47
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:20,441
that road but if you can not reach Sholapur
then you are not there in Sholapur.

48
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:26,411
So even if you say this is the way it has
to be, unless and until somebody does it in

49
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:31,120
a practical way, in actualization you have
to achieve it.

50
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,300
This is the problem.

51
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,951
Actual this is the problem, that exist between
all the people who are seeking, between all

52
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:43,201
the enterprises, between all the moment we
have.

53
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:47,111
There is no quarrel between God and Science.

54
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:51,651
One thing one should remember that Science
has come from God to you.

55
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:53,571
It has not come from you.

56
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:55,851
For example, if you say there is gravity.

57
00:40:55,851 --> 00:40:59,911
Now, you have not put gravity in the Mother
Earth, did you?

58
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:05,001
We can not even transform one flower into
a fruit.

59
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:06,811
Not one flower into fruit.

60
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:08,171
Can you imagine?

61
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:12,240
So there is some living power which is doing
this living job.

62
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,830
Now think an Indian has a child he is an Indian,
this sorting out is done.

63
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:24,541
You know that any foreign matter that goes
into the body is thrown away.

64
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,650
Has to be thrown away.

65
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:31,281
But when the fetus is conceived, then it is
kept, nourished, properly looked after and

66
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:35,561
is thrown out at the right time.

67
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,221
Who does that job?

68
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,471
We must think.

69
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:47,291
There are so many things for example acidic
(* unclear text- some medical name) of course

70
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:51,221
doctors, I must say or scientists are honest.

71
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:54,631
So they say, their mode of action in human
body they can not explain.

72
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:58,321
They just openly say if they can not.

73
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:02,001
Because it may augment or it may not.

74
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:05,680
But Sahaja yoga can explain, why it happens.

75
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,311
Why it has to happen like that.

76
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:18,120
Now the jumping from this knowledge from the
mind into the knowledge of the eternal is

77
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,341
a difficult task.

78
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,341
To accept it.

79
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:26,640
Because as doctor (*unclear text) has told
you that when we get education we think we

80
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,071
know quite a lot.

81
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,900
Not that you do not know.

82
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,532
Not that, this knowledge is not needed.

83
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:33,532
Its very important.

84
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:35,990
If you are a doctor, you will be a great sahaja
yogi.

85
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,990
No doubt.

86
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:43,330
But something is not known to you which is
much greater than what is known to you.

87
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:51,830
So this human awareness, this “chetna”
that is within you today has to rise to that

88
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:58,360
level or you have to become that subtle that
you can enter into your roots.

89
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Alright?

90
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,761
So on this point we start moving further that
you are paying attention to me but if I say

91
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:07,881
pay attention to yourself.

92
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,591
You can not.

93
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:12,430
How will you do it.

94
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,430
You can not do it.

95
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,941
You can not see your self, you can not see
your organs, you can not see your body, you

96
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:20,420
can not see anything, you can not see your
mind.

97
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,031
You can not feel it.

98
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,071
So what should happen?

99
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:31,580
Say something falls down, immediately our
attention goes there.

100
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:38,120
Some happening has to take place within ourselves
and that happening is nothing but kundalini

101
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,890
awakening.

102
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:47,511
Now this kundalini is a force which is lying
in the triangular bone which is called as

103
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:48,511
sacrum.

104
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:55,511
(Shri Mataji asks for some water in hindi/marathi)
I have been speaking and speaking and hours

105
00:43:55,511 --> 00:44:04,441
and hours together.

106
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:08,191
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum.

107
00:44:08,191 --> 00:44:10,091
Sacrum means sacred.

108
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:12,031
In greek language, sacrum means sacred.

109
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:17,490
When I went to Greece, I asked them why do
you call it sacrum?

110
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:25,621
So they told me that they had a rapport with
Indians much much before, Alexander came here

111
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:31,761
and the Indians told them that there is a
power in this triangular bone.

112
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,111
Can you imagine?

113
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:40,711
We have forgotten it, we have lost it because
we have studied only the british or whatever

114
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,801
is english or you can call it a western medical
science.

115
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:50,611
But in our science, you will be surprised,
fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has

116
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:52,501
talked about it.

117
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:59,991
We Indians are best suited to understand this.

118
00:44:59,991 --> 00:45:05,771
Now many people say that Mahasrashtra has
got three and a half “pithas”.

119
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:11,461
Many people must have heard there are three
and a half “pithas” one of them is “Mahalaxmi”,

120
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:20,631
then another is “Tulzapur Bhavani” then
third one is “Mahur” and half one is “Chaturshringi”.

121
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,541
Now (*unclear text) something so funny and
stupid.

122
00:45:23,541 --> 00:45:27,891
I mean, I can undertand as doctors.

123
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,751
But its not.

124
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:30,991
Believe me.

125
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:35,141
These are the three and a half coils of the
kundalini of the whole universe placed in

126
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:36,701
your Maharashtra.

127
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:51,131
They are the source of that power within your
own country this great Maharashtra.

128
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:55,111
Now people may not believe it.

129
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:59,771
But how will you know?

130
00:45:59,771 --> 00:46:06,351
Now, somebody says “this is a “jagrut
sthana” (means awakened place) I mean doctors

131
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:07,351
do namaskar to Ganesha and they go to temple
and all.

132
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:16,511
But they do not know that Ganesha is placed
within us and he controls our prostate and

133
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:18,791
he controls all our pelvic plexuses.

134
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:21,891
We do not know this.

135
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:26,641
But he resides there.

136
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:37,181
So to jump from that to this is rather difficult
for a medical man, I understand that.

137
00:46:37,181 --> 00:46:42,611
(unclear/inaudible text) who were studying
with me I never talk to them about Kundalini

138
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:43,611
or anything.

139
00:46:43,611 --> 00:46:46,361
I just wanted to be like them to understand
how their brains have worked.

140
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:50,511
For them, this is knowledge, this is everything,
nothing beyond.

141
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:56,051
And anybody who talks about it they turn faces
like that.

142
00:46:56,051 --> 00:47:02,301
Now I do not want you to come to any conclusion
by saying of course Gyaneshwara has talked

143
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:07,331
about it so he can not be wrong and this and
that.

144
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:09,551
Not at all.

145
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:19,561
But scientifically, we have to understand
that we have not got answers to many questions.

146
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:24,541
That means there is no sufficient light, in
our knowledge.

147
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:29,481
If you are coming in this room in darkness
you might find a mic, you might find a table,

148
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:30,991
you might find something.

149
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:32,781
This becomes the truth.

150
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:36,151
Because the eyes are not yet opened or the
light is not there.

151
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:41,231
But supposing by any chance, somebody can
open the light, you can see all the things.

152
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,231
Isn’t it?

153
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:47,701
That what doctor Berjodi ji is talking about
the integration part.

154
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,631
Now this light is nothing but your auto.

155
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:53,361
Which you talk of as “Autonomous Nervous
System”.

156
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:55,781
You just give the name, Auto.

157
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,391
Now, who is auto?

158
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:58,601
We accept it.

159
00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:04,381
When we get the names, we just accept the
name, we never ask why it is called auto.

160
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:11,221
Because it is “swayamchalit” (which runs
by itself) who is the swayam?

161
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,771
Who is the “sw” is the spirit.

162
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:19,361
In a way, we have accepted because we have
to fix somebody as auto otherwise we don’t

163
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:20,361
know what to do.

164
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:25,811
I mean, we see parasympathetic working, sympathetic
working so we have to fix up somebody as a

165
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:29,571
person behind the two.

166
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:32,891
But that auto is the spirit, is the “atma”,
we do not want to accept.

167
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:33,891
Alright.

168
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:34,891
We will call it auto if you don’t like it.

169
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:38,711
For the scientist, if they don’t like it
we will call it auto only.

170
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:43,141
So this Mr. auto, is the atma according to
Sahaja Yoga.

171
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:45,631
We call it atma, you call it auto.

172
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,661
That’s the only difference of names.

173
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,541
Now this auto exists within us.

174
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:57,001
But this auto is not in our central nervous
system.

175
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,001
That is true.

176
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,201
Because we can not control our parasympathetic.

177
00:49:01,201 --> 00:49:08,991
We may be able to excite our sympathetic but
not the parasympathetic, that’s the fact.

178
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:12,271
Sympathetic, if we excite, it, we can work
out.

179
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:14,771
But parasympathetic we can not work out.

180
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,151
It works automatically.

181
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:22,801
So somehow or other, if you can bring that
auto in your attention or in your central

182
00:49:22,801 --> 00:49:28,071
nervous system then you can manage the show
better.

183
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:29,851
Scientifically.

184
00:49:29,851 --> 00:49:32,071
I am just going scientifically.

185
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:33,071
Alright.

186
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:36,791
Now, how to bring this auto in your attention?

187
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,021
How to control this auto?

188
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,611
Is the problem.

189
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,251
You can not do through science.

190
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,131
You can not do through medical science.

191
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,321
Through any science you can not do.

192
00:49:46,321 --> 00:49:50,541
Because this will only happen when you will
evolve to another stage.

193
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,711
And science can not bring in evolution.

194
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:53,711
Can it?

195
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:58,141
It can not give you wisdom and it can not
give you evolution.

196
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:01,281
Evolution it can not give.

197
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:03,311
Why?

198
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:13,641
It can not even create life, I would say.

199
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:21,201
So this auto, to be in your central nervous
system we should look inside ourselves.

200
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:30,301
There could be some arrangement and for that
the knowledge is in your great country.

201
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:32,221
Already there.

202
00:50:32,221 --> 00:50:36,071
You are the one who have inherited that (unclear
text).

203
00:50:36,071 --> 00:50:39,791
This is what you have inherited.

204
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:44,131
It is your inheritance which is lost.

205
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:50,171
But one must know that when the tree grows
too high it must have roots.

206
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:54,651
And that is how, whatever they are saying
about me..I am the tap root, I must say.

207
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:59,851
Who has done the seeking inside perhaps or
I have reached at source and that’s how

208
00:50:59,851 --> 00:51:02,831
I know what is the root.

209
00:51:02,831 --> 00:51:10,181
In our country, many saints have tried to
go through that path and have found out.

210
00:51:10,181 --> 00:51:14,801
They have tried to express it in many ways
but they kept it a secret till the sixth century

211
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:18,551
when Adi Shankaracharya came and he talked
about it very clearly.

212
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:24,201
He talked about kundalini, he talked about
all the chakras, he talked about everything.

213
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:26,811
But who reads Adi Shankaracharya.

214
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:30,581
Atleast the medical man does not.

215
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:38,861
I mean, I don’t blame them because they
are so busy.

216
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:40,921
And after that it was all exposed.

217
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:43,871
Then Kabira clearly, clearly, clearly absolutely
clearly talked about it.

218
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:47,311
So Sahaja yoga is not a new system.

219
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,371
It is “Anadi”, it is old.

220
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:53,811
Only thing, what has happened to Sahaja Yoga
today that it has become a “Mahayoga”.

221
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:58,121
That there are many many thousands can get
realization.

222
00:51:58,121 --> 00:51:59,581
That was not possible and feasible.

223
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:05,871
This is the only thing that has happened that
today the blossom time has come and many flowers

224
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:08,741
can become fruits.

225
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:12,061
And that’s how even an ordinary person gets
self realization.

226
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:16,731
A poor man can get realization, a doctor can
get realization.

227
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:20,461
Anybody can get realization.

228
00:52:20,461 --> 00:52:22,431
And sooner you get the better it is.

229
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:26,271
So now the first thing what will happen to
you.

230
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:28,831
Supposing you get the light within yourself
and you can see within yourself.

231
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:32,421
Say you have an X-ray to see yourself within
yourself.

232
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:36,421
So first thing that should happen to you is
that you should know about yourself, what’s

233
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:38,951
the problem with you.

234
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:45,321
You’ll be amazed people end up in lunatic
asylums and till they are absolutely gone

235
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,851
cases people do not know that they are mad.

236
00:52:48,851 --> 00:52:49,851
Same about cancer.

237
00:52:49,851 --> 00:52:55,011
I would say, cancer can be detected much earlier
than doctors can detect it.

238
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:58,570
Very simple it is.

239
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:01,731
Any disease connected with liver is another
thing.

240
00:53:01,731 --> 00:53:07,410
I would say even liver problems are not detected
till a patient gets a cirrhosis or some sort

241
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:15,510
of a disease which is absolutely fatal and
you declare alright, now you go into coma.

242
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,510
Finished!

243
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,451
These can be detected through Sahaja Yoga
very well because once you are enlightened,

244
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,581
your fingers.

245
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:26,650
These five fingers, six and seven (ShriMataji
describes the chakras on her palm) They start

246
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,650
denoting the centers.

247
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,030
And on these fingers you can know.

248
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:35,900
Now according to Sahaja Yoga left side deals,
left side sympathetic deals with your emotional

249
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,731
side and right side deals with physical and
mental side.

250
00:53:39,731 --> 00:53:40,731
Clearcut.

251
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:45,900
So now you see a person who is very busy.

252
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,240
Who is a doctor, say for example.

253
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,071
He is a very busy man and he has no time at
all.

254
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:59,020
He is always looking at his watch, naturally.

255
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,061
So what happens to him?

256
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:03,571
He becomes a right sided person.

257
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:07,491
Because he is using his physical being and
also he is mental being.

258
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:10,870
But the emotional becomes little dried out.

259
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,770
So emotionally he is not so good.

260
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,341
Emotionally, he goes off.

261
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:18,171
As a result, you won’t believe.

262
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:23,001
As a result of this imbalance what disease
one can get to being with.

263
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:26,660
According to Sahaja Yoga, this is another
principle.

264
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,390
According to Sahaja Yoga because I will not
say that medical people will agree to it or

265
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:31,400
they have found out.

266
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,270
They might find out later on but just now
they have not found, so far.

267
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:38,321
Because I did medicine, because you are all
younger to me in age.

268
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:41,780
So when i did my medicine you might have been
just young boys.

269
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,701
So may be my terminology may be little different.

270
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,731
But does not matter.

271
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:51,551
So according to Sahaja Yoga the brain is made
of fat cells.

272
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:54,101
That is according to medical science also.

273
00:54:54,101 --> 00:55:01,640
Now these fat cells, when they are used too
much they are replaced, they are replaced

274
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,581
by the fat of the stomach.

275
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:11,971
And the conversion for the use of the brain
of the special cells is created by a center

276
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:16,770
we call at “Swadhisthana Chakra” which
actually on the physical level you can say

277
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,551
is aortic plexus.

278
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:19,551
On the physical.

279
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,691
In the “Sukshama” (subtle) is swadhisthana
Chakra.

280
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:30,121
So one of the jobs of the swadhisthana chakra
is to convert these cells for the use of the

281
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:31,121
brain.

282
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:38,880
And the other job is to look after your liver,
look after your pancreas, look after your

283
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,390
spleen and your kidneys and in ladies, uterus.

284
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,130
Part of it.

285
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:50,591
So when you think too much or plan too much
and you are futuristic.

286
00:55:50,591 --> 00:55:56,471
Most of the time this poor one, swadhistahana
chakra is busy coping with that thinking process

287
00:55:56,471 --> 00:55:58,520
and replacing the brain cells.

288
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Alright.

289
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,481
So it neglects all these organs which are
very vital and important to us.

290
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:13,811
So the first trouble one many get by thinking
too much is diabetes.

291
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:18,311
Now, if you ask a doctor, he will say don’t
eat sugar.

292
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:21,630
But this is no cure of the disease.

293
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,061
But you see villagers eat at least five spoons
in one cup of tea.

294
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:28,081
At least five spoons.

295
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:30,101
They never get diabetes.

296
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:36,260
It’s only the people who think and plan
too much for the future get it.

297
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,640
First is diabetes.

298
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,691
The another is very dangerous is leukemia.

299
00:56:44,691 --> 00:56:51,311
Leukemia also one gets from the same type
of life style.

300
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:52,980
Believe me.

301
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,741
Because you know at emergencies, this spleen
has to produce new RBCs(red blood corpuscles)

302
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:01,790
that is accepted.

303
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,790
Alright.

304
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:10,681
Now, a person who is getting up in the morning,
see rushing up, just, its very interesting

305
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:11,681
how it is.

306
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:13,331
Just think of it.

307
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:17,211
Everybody does that but we never see ourselves
how we behave.

308
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:21,901
And he goes to the bathroom and comes out
with his pants just being tied up and the

309
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:25,490
wife is there to give him breakfast and one
side he is eating the breakfast.

310
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,010
Then is reading the newspaper getting another
shocks after shocks from the newspaper then

311
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:34,231
he gets into the car and there is jam and
he does not know how to drive and all that.

312
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:37,851
He is a sure patient for leukemia.

313
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:46,280
Because poor this spleen has to produce new
blood corpuscles all the time and it becomes

314
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,280
hectic.

315
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,280
Now you may question me, why the children
get it?

316
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,280
Because the parents must be like that.

317
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,601
This is the parents also who can make the
children hectic.

318
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:57,181
Get up in the morning, go to the school, what
are you doing, this, that..all the time if

319
00:57:57,181 --> 00:58:03,770
you are after your child with a stick in your
hand, the child is due for it.

320
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:09,091
A mother, who is you see too clever, at home
and very particular about her kitchen and

321
00:58:09,091 --> 00:58:15,441
cleanliness of the whole thing and she can
get after her child.

322
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:21,360
And such a thing completely upsets that poor
spleen.

323
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,931
And the production of RBCs use their cells
of proportion.

324
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:27,381
Of Course there is a trigery.

325
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:33,561
And the trigering takes place as the doctors
call it, I mean recently i saw it that they

326
00:58:33,561 --> 00:58:36,270
call it by Proteins 52 and Proteins 58.

327
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:39,030
That they call it, these are attacks.

328
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:44,321
This recently I saw it in England, the research,
the cancer research people had given this

329
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,770
(unclear text) explanation.

330
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:52,880
And they said it comes from the areas built
within us from of our creation.

331
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,740
And we call it collective subconsious.

332
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,571
In Sahaja Yoga we call it collective subconsious.

333
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:05,390
Beyond our conscious mind there is subconscious
mind and beyond the subconsious mind there

334
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:11,081
is collective subconscious mind on the left
hand side.

335
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:15,130
Now, according to them these are Proteins
52 and 58 whatever you may call it.

336
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:21,381
Whatever you may call it but we call it a
“bhoot badha”(posession), a simple word.

337
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:24,431
Or you may call it a “kali-vidya” (black
magic or false knowledge) or whatever it is.

338
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:31,801
But it is nothing but it is an attack of a
dead soul on a person.

339
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:33,530
Absolutely, it exists.

340
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,601
And that is how it triggers.

341
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:48,061
Now virus infection is also the attack of
the vegetables, we can or the vegetations

342
00:59:48,061 --> 00:59:52,671
which have gone out the circulation of your
evolution.

343
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,061
That’s virus infection.

344
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:58,780
I mean, if you know the source from where
it is coming, you can stop it, isn’t it?

345
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,071
Now, doctors can’t believe a bhoot but once
they are caught up with a bhoot, they know

346
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:03,761
it is a bhoot.

347
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:08,451
Like a met a doctor, was a in in charge of
the hospital and his son was possessed.

348
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:11,951
So he came to me and said, “Mother, please
somehow or the other, save my son.

349
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:14,691
I don’t know what to do.” and I cured
him.

350
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:16,010
He said, “how did you cure?”.

351
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,711
I said its simple, he is possessed.

352
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:21,530
And he was possessed by something and is removed.

353
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,530
Its simple.

354
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,861
But to tell a doctor, I mean you are in for
trouble.

355
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:27,421
But its a fact.

356
01:00:27,421 --> 01:00:29,361
Believe me, it’s a fact.

357
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:34,941
The triggering they have said about 52 and
58, I mean call it anything like auto to call

358
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:36,551
to “Atma” you call it auto.

359
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:37,551
Alright.

360
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,551
So what can we do about it?

361
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:44,581
Or if you call it to a “bhoot-badha” as
protein 52 and 58, what should we do?

362
01:00:44,581 --> 01:00:51,250
I mean you have more sophisticated names perhaps
but its simple like that.

363
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:58,751
So once a person has that kind of wobbly spleen,
he is a good case.

364
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:02,540
He is a good case for getting leukemia.

365
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:09,701
Now let’s come to the best part of it, what
one can get ultimately.

366
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:16,001
That, when your attention is so much outside
then your spirit in the heart gets upset and

367
01:01:16,001 --> 01:01:20,841
you get a heart attack.

368
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:23,251
All heart attacks are due to this kind of
thing.

369
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:29,510
There are two types of hearts; Heart diseases
according to Sahaja Yoga.

370
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,551
It’s very simple.

371
01:01:30,551 --> 01:01:33,731
One is a lethargic heart and one is over active
heart.

372
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:42,500
The over active heart gets a heart attack
when, whether you are thin or fat makes no

373
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
difference.

374
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:49,611
The lethargic heart may be from the fat but
the active heart, the one who is extremely

375
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:50,611
active.

376
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:55,160
All the time thinking of the future and all
that is in for a heart attack.

377
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,591
It’s so simple as that.

378
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:01,640
So now, you have to just give a balance to
a person.

379
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,510
Who is a right sided, you give him a balance.

380
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,801
Make left and right, he is cured.

381
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:15,581
When you know the “tatwa”, the principle-how
you get diseases then can you not cure it,

382
01:02:15,581 --> 01:02:17,350
if you know how to cure the “tatwa”?

383
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,321
Sahaja yoga is like that.

384
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:25,461
Sahaja yoga knows the principle and principles
are a few.

385
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,431
Like colors are very few.

386
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:28,431
Isn’t it?

387
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:29,431
The mixtures are there.

388
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:30,961
Permutations and combinations are there.

389
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:37,051
But if you know the principle, you just put
the principle right and the person is alright.

390
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:44,660
Like the person (unclear text) was going to
Houston for a By-pass(surgery) and I was speaking

391
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,211
in a Rotary Club, in Delhi.

392
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:50,730
There were about two thousand people.

393
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,630
Suddenly he (text1-shot up/text2- stood up)
came to me and said, “Mother I have to go

394
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,630
to Houston”.

395
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:58,141
I said but I am flying out today to Bombay
to go to Pune.

396
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,171
I have to go to Pune.

397
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:00,461
He said, “I live in Pune”.

398
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:02,040
I said, Alright, I’ll meet you there.

399
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,311
He came to see me twice, I think and I gave
him vibrations then he went back to Bombay

400
01:03:07,311 --> 01:03:08,821
and all the doctors said, “Oh!

401
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:09,821
What happened?

402
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:13,451
These were not your, perhaps these were not
your X-rays or what?

403
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:14,451
Its completely cured.

404
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:18,191
100% and all that By-pass and all that is
over.

405
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:22,600
And for this, what are you going to pay?

406
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,571
This is just flowing.

407
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:26,400
I mean you are also not obliging anyone.

408
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,381
That’s the worst part of it that people
think I am obliging.

409
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:31,381
No.

410
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:36,691
See, if you are part and parcel of me, say
for example My finger is something wrong and

411
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:41,030
I just rub it then I am obliging my finger?

412
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,321
I mean if you are part and parcel of me how
can I oblige you?

413
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:52,630
That’s what they were saying that you have
to become the part and parcel of the whole.

414
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,691
You just become part and parcel of the whole.

415
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:58,010
The arbitrary behaviour becomes malignant.

416
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:05,171
Arbitrary behaviour of a cell becomes malignancy.

417
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:09,120
Because the centers, now I will tell you about
cancer also on the same simple way.

418
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,561
See, its a simple way of explaining cancer.

419
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:13,561
Any cancer.

420
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:19,931
Now, we can say that, with my hands I might
be able to show you that left hand and right

421
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:23,563
hand are two sympathetic nervous systems and
these are the centers in between.

422
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:24,563
You can see that.

423
01:04:24,563 --> 01:04:25,563
(Shri Mataji makes a pyramid with her fingers
and joins the thumbs and index fingers of

424
01:04:25,563 --> 01:04:26,563
both the hands to show the position.)

425
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:27,563
Alright.

426
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,563
These are the centers.

427
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:32,721
Now, what happens..a person starts a doing
something extraordinary.

428
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:35,410
Something emergency he creates within himself.

429
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,390
It can be with anything.

430
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:42,711
Now he creates an emergency uses too much
of his sympathetic supposing he uses the right

431
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:43,711
side too much.

432
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:47,231
Then what happens is this starts wobbling
like that.

433
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:48,601
(Shri MAtaji shows this with her hands) this
center.

434
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:56,520
And the center starts wobbling and the, there
is a deity inside this which keeps the relationship

435
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,520
with the whole.

436
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,620
The deity just sleeps off and the relationship
is broken.

437
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:07,611
The relationship with the whole is broken
because the medulla oblongata has got you

438
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:13,380
see, inside though to the physical mind it
has not broken but to the subtle thing, is

439
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,380
finished.

440
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,380
There is no relationship with the whole.

441
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:18,461
So what happens, the cells here have no messages.

442
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,921
So they become on their own.

443
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,171
And they start becoming bigger and bigger.

444
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:24,171
They become on their own.

445
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:28,681
You see, they become very ambitious.They start
growing bigger and bigger.

446
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:30,081
That’s how you get malignancy.

447
01:05:30,081 --> 01:05:31,081
Simple thing as that.

448
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:33,572
Now what do we do for Sahaja Yoga. it is very
simple.

449
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:38,410
If you are a realized soul what you have to
do is very simple is to just put your hand

450
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,730
to the center at the back.

451
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:43,431
So by giving vibrations you awaken the deity
and its again sucked back.

452
01:05:43,431 --> 01:05:48,770
You have put together in relationship with
the whole.

453
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:54,270
I mean, I must tell you I cured Mr. Sanjeev
Reddy, you may write to him and ask him.

454
01:05:54,270 --> 01:06:00,171
Now he had come from America he had gone for
an operation and the operation was a failure.

455
01:06:00,171 --> 01:06:01,451
And he was in a horrible mess.

456
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:05,481
He could not sleep and he was in a big pain
and they tried all kinds of injections and

457
01:06:05,481 --> 01:06:10,801
I mean you can imagine Sanjeev Reddy (unclear
text) I went with my husband to see him because

458
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:11,801
he knew my husband.

459
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,010
He knew me also.

460
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,671
But our high commissioner was * Nehru and
I don’t know why he said to his wife, “you

461
01:06:17,671 --> 01:06:22,240
know, this is Mataji Nirmala Devi” She had
heard my name in Delhi.

462
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,100
She said, “Mataji please cure my husband”
otherwise my husband is not going to say anything.

463
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,611
So I just put my hand on his back, for ten
minutes.

464
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,421
You won’t believe, in ten minutes.

465
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:32,421
Oh God!

466
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,280
I am feeling so relaxed, let me sleep now.

467
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,211
He slept off and they were thinking...I mean
it was all last thing.

468
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:44,951
See, so they had prepared everything that
they didn’t expect him to come alive.

469
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:47,211
And when walked out they got a shock of their
lives.

470
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:50,360
You see, they had brought ambulances, he said
“I don’t need any ambulance, nothing.

471
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,691
And just walked off,you see.

472
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:54,571
And then he went on for a tour.

473
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:56,980
And then when i went to see him, he showed
me his back.

474
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:04,571
He said, “even the scratches, which one
should see atleast a scratch of the operation.

475
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:08,000
Even there is not even a scratch, you can’t
see.

476
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Imagine.

477
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,620
The kundalini has done it.

478
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,410
The kundalini is your mother.

479
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:17,691
She is the one, sitting down there.

480
01:07:17,691 --> 01:07:19,860
Just waiting this thing to happen.

481
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,280
Because she is your “Shudha icha” (pure
desire).

482
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,441
She is the pure desire.

483
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:26,380
The rest are “Vikrutas”.

484
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,831
They are perverted.

485
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:32,510
The real desire one has is to become one with
God.

486
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:36,660
unless and until that desire is fulfilled
you are not going to be happy.

487
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,231
So that desire is sitting down there.

488
01:07:39,231 --> 01:07:40,620
She is your mother.

489
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,900
Everybody has individual mother.

490
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,441
And when this pure desire rises, she integrates
all these centers.

491
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:50,750
That’s how you get integrated.

492
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:55,071
And then she comes upto here (Shri Mataji
touches her Sahastrara) and you can even feel.

493
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,441
In many people the “lup-dup” you see.

494
01:07:57,441 --> 01:08:00,941
“Anahat”, anahat means without percussion.

495
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:05,850
The sound you hear on the head.

496
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:09,520
You can even see in many people the kundalini
pulsating.

497
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,040
Actually with naked eyes you can see.

498
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:19,250
Today only, we had somebody who had a kundalini
which was just pulsating at the base.

499
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:22,400
If there is no way of getting out, pulsates.

500
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,860
Poor thing, you know it just...some people
have just kundalini that just goes on tossing

501
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:33,150
that “oh God, when I am going to give birth
to my child.”

502
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,371
and then.

503
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:36,601
If you can smooth it out, bring it out.

504
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:37,601
It just comes up.

505
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:41,120
And then you feel a cool breeze coming out
of your head.

506
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,061
Which is not possible medically.

507
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:44,990
Is it possible?

508
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:51,351
You feel a cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel cool breeze blowing into your

509
01:08:51,351 --> 01:08:52,351
hands.

510
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,351
Then, this is the power.

511
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:54,351
Which is the all-pervading power.

512
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:57,591
The “Brahma-tatwa” which you can use.

513
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,831
Which is all integrated.

514
01:08:59,831 --> 01:09:05,431
In Sahaja Yoga language we call it Mahakali,
Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati.

515
01:09:05,431 --> 01:09:10,660
Then you understand, what was Mohammed Saa’b,
what was Zoraster, what was Christ, who they

516
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,660
are.

517
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Everything we understand.

518
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,921
They are all integrated, we are only people
fighting among ourselves.

519
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:20,760
And it works out so beautifully you can’t
imagine.

520
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:25,071
I wish, all of you get your realization and
work it out.

521
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:28,561
I would like to answer your questions, if
you have any please ask me.

522
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:32,660
And then let’s have it.

523
01:09:32,660 --> 01:10:02,811
(Shri Mataji finishes her lecture and sits
down at the chair)

524
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:03,811
Someone from the audience:- Inaudible text.

525
01:10:03,811 --> 01:10:04,811
Shri Mataji in hindi:- What are they saying?

526
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:05,811
Yogi:- Can any accidents can occur in Kundalini?

527
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:07,051
Shri Mataji:- No, no not in this.

528
01:10:07,051 --> 01:10:11,761
You see, now there are people who have written
books and books about kundalini.

529
01:10:11,761 --> 01:10:14,691
I was myself shocked you know when I read
them.

530
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:15,691
It’s all absurd.

531
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:19,921
You see a person who does not know how to
handle even a scalper and tries to operate

532
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:22,061
someone, what will happen?

533
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:24,191
That’s what it is.

534
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:25,251
Audience:- Inaudible.

535
01:10:25,251 --> 01:10:29,401
Shri MAtaji:- No, kundalini process there
are no accidents, nothing.

536
01:10:29,401 --> 01:10:31,150
Nothing happens like that.

537
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:41,491
I am just telling that these are Naive people
who do not know how to handle it.

538
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,261
Alright!

539
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:55,251
Audience:- They are saying now that guru is
needed for all this yoga and (* unclear text.)

540
01:10:55,251 --> 01:11:01,121
Shri MAtaji:- They are saying because they
don’t know how to do it.

541
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:07,281
Supposing somebody says, “oh you see, Medical
Science is horrible, don’t go near it.”

542
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:11,121
Because they don’t about it what can you
do?

543
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:15,771
It’s like putting your fingers in the plug
and saying that electricity is shocking.

544
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,141
You must know the thing.

545
01:11:17,141 --> 01:11:27,521
First of all and secondly such a person has
to be a person of character.

546
01:11:27,521 --> 01:11:37,511
You see a man who is taking money from you,
God does not give blessings to such a man.

547
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:38,511
Isn’t it?

548
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:56,741
Or he is trying to make money out of you or
he is trying to be...he is a bad character

549
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:13,591
man, is a horrible man and he has….you know
“paapi man” (sinner) you can call it.

550
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:19,171
Such a person can not do it.

551
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:20,691
He doesn’t do it.

552
01:12:20,691 --> 01:12:23,201
These are all money making propositions.

553
01:12:23,201 --> 01:12:27,481
And it is only Shri Ganesha who gets angry.

554
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:28,561
Not kundalini.

555
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:44,111
Poor thing she does not do anything but it
is the anger of Shri Ganesha which works on

556
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,111
the sympathetic.

557
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,111
That also you will know, what happens.

558
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,111
Audience:- (Unclear text) bhakti in Sahaja
Yoga?

559
01:12:47,111 --> 01:12:48,111
Shri Mataji:- Bhakti?

560
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:49,111
Bhakti is very important.

561
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:50,111
I mean if you believe in God, then God looks
after you.

562
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:51,111
But Bhakti can be an extreme step also.

563
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:52,111
Like you are calling, “God, God” when
the God stands before you still you are calling

564
01:12:52,111 --> 01:12:53,111
God.

565
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:54,111
You see that is too much.

566
01:12:54,111 --> 01:12:55,111
Isn’t it?

567
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:56,111
Like, Tulsidasa he wrote so much about Ramayana
and all that.

568
01:12:56,111 --> 01:13:01,121
But when Shri Rama came to him and he also
gave him a (unclear) still he could not recognize

569
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:02,121
him.

570
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:03,121
So what’s the use of such a blind bhakti.

571
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:04,121
It should not be blind.

572
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:05,121
It should be from heart.

573
01:13:05,121 --> 01:13:06,121
Very important.

574
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,121
If somebody is a man who has done bhakti from
his heart he gets Sahaja Yoga very fast.

575
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:08,121
But actually, now I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
has become so powerful that everyone gets

576
01:13:08,121 --> 01:13:09,121
realization.

577
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:10,121
Not difficult.

578
01:13:10,121 --> 01:13:11,121
Everyone gets it, not difficult.

579
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:12,121
In the villages if you see six thousand people
sitting, all will raise hands.

580
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,121
But the complicated and rather difficult (unclear
text) or if you have some disease.

581
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:14,121
That also you can make out on the kundalini
but and also there kundalini stops.

582
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:15,121
You’ll be amazed if there is somebody.

583
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,121
Say comes to me and he has a liver problem
then the kundalini goes and she goes on hitting

584
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:17,121
the liver you see.

585
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:20,381
And even a person who does not understands
that liver is there, he puts his hand and

586
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:22,951
there because he sees the kundalini hitting
there.

587
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:26,021
So it just shows where the problem is.

588
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:30,561
Even if you don’t understand any medicine
you will know where the problem is because

589
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:32,881
you know the kundalini will go and start hitting
that point.

590
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:39,471
And you will see with your naked eyes.

591
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:46,531
Audience: How would you explain the pulsation
of the head in kundalini, please?

592
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:49,631
Shri MAtaji:- Sahastrara you mean?

593
01:13:49,631 --> 01:13:54,601
Audience:- According to A* (unclear text)
because as we know in case of an adult…

594
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,591
Shri Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you.

595
01:13:56,591 --> 01:14:01,741
In the brain you see, where the pituitary
and pineal body, in the center of that you

596
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:03,891
can say the optic chaisma.

597
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:06,061
There is a very subtle center called Agya
Chakra.

598
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:07,891
Which is very important.

599
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:11,301
Which goes on working when you think too much.

600
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:19,361
And the backside is the one which is surrounded
by, you see..I would say that the limbic area

601
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:20,361
has got all the seven chakras.

602
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:21,701
All the seven chakras within it.

603
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,231
All the seven chakras limbic area has.

604
01:14:24,231 --> 01:14:25,711
But they are called as the “Pithas”.

605
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,221
Pitahs means the seats of the chakras.

606
01:14:28,221 --> 01:14:30,231
So all these chakras are represented in our
brain.

607
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:31,231
Alright.

608
01:14:31,231 --> 01:14:32,381
In the limbic area.

609
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:39,701
Now out of that this agya chakra is genuinely
here and the pitha is also here.

610
01:14:39,701 --> 01:14:45,301
The outside, this is the window of that agya
chakra which is in the center of pitutary

611
01:14:45,301 --> 01:14:48,791
and pineal and it controls pituitary and pineal.

612
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:49,791
Alright.

613
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:57,891
Now, at the back side of it, it has only two
windows so it is here and here at the back.

614
01:14:57,891 --> 01:15:02,261
And surrounding that, surrounding is Swadhisthana
Chakra.

615
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:06,361
The same one i told you about working poor
thing which has to work very hard.

616
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:12,341
Now this one, when you get diabetes what happens
that the swadhisthana goes out of order and

617
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,171
that’s how you get blind.

618
01:15:15,171 --> 01:15:17,991
Because swadisthana is surrounding this.

619
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:18,991
Here.

620
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,341
so all the seven chakras are in the limbic
area.

621
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:22,341
Is very interesting.

622
01:15:22,341 --> 01:15:26,071
Yogi:- He said that how do you get the pulsation
here? (he points his hand to sahastrara)

623
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:27,071
Shri Mataji:- Pulsation here?

624
01:15:27,071 --> 01:15:28,071
Pulsation you said?

625
01:15:28,071 --> 01:15:29,071
Yogi:- Yes.

626
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,701
Shri Mataji:- because the kundalini rises,
she crosses through this (Shri MAtaji points

627
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,011
to the Agya Chara) and then you start feeling
the pulsation.

628
01:15:34,011 --> 01:15:35,641
Because it is trying to break through.

629
01:15:35,641 --> 01:15:40,145
When it breaks, then you get the, that’s
how you get the pulsation.

630
01:15:40,145 --> 01:15:43,921
You can even with the stethoscope hear the
pulsation on the different chakras to begin

631
01:15:43,921 --> 01:15:46,311
with then ultimately here you get the pulsation.

632
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,311
Then it breaks, you see.

633
01:15:47,311 --> 01:15:51,801
The thing it becomes, you know fontanelle
bone area becomes soft.

634
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:53,711
Just like a child’s fontanelle bone.

635
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:58,971
In a person who is bald headed, sometimes
you see the whole thing opening out like that

636
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:04,581
and then you feel the cool breeze coming out.

637
01:16:04,581 --> 01:16:12,971
Pause
Shri MAtaji:- So should we have realization?

638
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:15,071
Let’s try.

639
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,221
(unclear text) Alright.

640
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:24,511
Take out your shoes, that’s it.

641
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:26,861
Because the Mother Earth helps us.

642
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:27,861
You see these are all the five elements which
have gone upside down.

643
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:28,861
That’s all.

644
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:29,861
Just take out your shoes.

645
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:30,861
That’s all.

646
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:31,861
Is very simple.

647
01:16:31,861 --> 01:16:32,861
Anybody can get no problem.

648
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:33,861
According to these western people, Indians
are very easy.

649
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:45,581
They are a very quality of people.

650
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:51,501
They are dharmic and they are very great,
according to them.

651
01:16:51,501 --> 01:16:57,611
And I must also confess that I really break
my hands in the west.

652
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,091
In India, I must say, they know it very well.

653
01:16:59,091 --> 01:17:00,741
They have to break also.

654
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,191
Not only me.

655
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:03,191
They have to do the same.

656
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:07,151
So they are very happy here because giving
realization to Indians is very easy.

657
01:17:07,151 --> 01:17:09,701
But giving realization to western people is
very difficult.

658
01:17:09,701 --> 01:17:11,241
So they also have suffered all of them.

659
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:13,941
So they will stand by me.

660
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:15,792
(unclear text) they all have, they all know
that this is the (bhoot?/Unclear) because

661
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,781
they are very complicated.

662
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:20,871
Extremely complicated.

663
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:24,861
So many attacks have come to them that they
are complicated, thinking is too much.

664
01:17:24,861 --> 01:17:28,356
Like this fellow “Freud” has to (Unclear)wrong
ideas into their heads.

665
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:35,281
And there is “Bawa” and all this nonsense
and who was that...what was the unholdy trinity

666
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:37,031
you were talking about?

667
01:17:37,031 --> 01:17:38,351
Where is he?

668
01:17:38,351 --> 01:17:39,351
Bryan?

669
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:40,541
“Freud nature of (God/gardener)..

670
01:17:40,541 --> 01:17:44,971
{Laughter, Shri MAtaji laughs then says a
sentence in Marathi}

671
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,721
Shri Mataji:- Ah, that’s it.

672
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:51,613
You see, that’s it, that’s how they have
been attacked.

673
01:17:51,613 --> 01:17:52,701
And they accepted all this.

674
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:58,311
You see, we may be educated in western education
but we don’t forget about God.

675
01:17:58,311 --> 01:18:04,091
I mean think about God as a part of us and
dharma is within us.

676
01:18:04,091 --> 01:18:10,621
(Shri Mataji says something in Marathi) and
even Indians if they take to adharmic life

677
01:18:10,621 --> 01:18:13,801
they still remember that this is adharmic.

678
01:18:13,801 --> 01:18:18,081
But for them it has become so difficult to
remember that this is dharmic, adharmic.

679
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:21,091
That’s an another world.

680
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,151
Another world, you (unclear) with them nothing
is dharma.

681
01:18:22,151 --> 01:18:23,151
Is poor thing you know.

682
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:28,111
They have been attacked so much and they are
all saints born.

683
01:18:28,111 --> 01:18:30,872
Surprising part is that they have been saints
they were born in such countries where there

684
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:36,991
was affluence and they are attacked.

685
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:41,071
These are saints, definitely.

686
01:18:41,071 --> 01:18:44,311
And those who are seekers there are tremendous
seekers.

687
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:50,171
I mean you will be amazed these people, they
have been druggists and alcoholics and all

688
01:18:50,171 --> 01:18:51,171
sorts of people.

689
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:52,171
But the day they get realization next day
they give up.

690
01:18:52,171 --> 01:18:53,171
Indians don’t.

691
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:54,171
(Everyone laughs.)

692
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:55,171
Indians are chickens.

693
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:56,171
They don’t.

694
01:18:56,171 --> 01:18:57,171
(Laughter, everyone laughs with Mother) I
must say.

695
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:58,171
Na, Indians don’t you know so easily.

696
01:18:58,171 --> 01:18:59,201
They do it, they are saints.

697
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:06,391
(pointing towards western yogies) this is
the quality that way is very good.

698
01:19:06,391 --> 01:19:09,391
But on the whole, you see totality.

699
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:13,321
I am saying, in general, it’s horrible.

700
01:19:13,321 --> 01:19:14,321
But they are saints.

701
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:17,981
Because the way they give up their things
is amazing.

702
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:19,101
Here, you give realization.

703
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:21,821
(Marathi sentence something about the habit
of having tobacco) it’s like that.

704
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:24,081
You see, they stick on to something.

705
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:27,361
I don’t know why, these people just give
up.

706
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:28,361
Overnight!

707
01:19:28,361 --> 01:19:29,361
They are very determined.

708
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:31,731
That’s how thing is there.

709
01:19:31,731 --> 01:19:36,551
I mean that goes in their favour and this
goes in your favour.

710
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:40,841
My condition is that some people don’t have
teeth, and some people don’t have “chanas”

711
01:19:40,841 --> 01:19:44,031
(roasted chickpeas) and some people don’t
have chanas and they have teeth.

712
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:45,231
It’s like that.

713
01:19:45,231 --> 01:19:47,241
So it’s a funny situation.

714
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,241
Alright.

715
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:49,241
So let’s have it.

716
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:54,141
Now you don’t have to be serious about it,
nothing but it is a very serene thing.

717
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:56,351
It’s not serious but serene.

718
01:19:56,351 --> 01:19:57,351
Just put your hands like this.

719
01:19:57,351 --> 01:20:01,401
(Shri Mataji opens her palms to show) that’s
all and close your eyes that’s all.

720
01:20:01,401 --> 01:20:02,941
That’s all.

721
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:08,351
Just put your hands straight like this.

722
01:20:08,351 --> 01:20:09,351
Straight!

723
01:20:09,351 --> 01:20:11,061
I think better to take out your spectacles
put them.

724
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:12,061
This also helps your eyes very much.

725
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:13,061
Spectacles you may remove later on.

726
01:20:13,061 --> 01:20:18,421
Just, it’s so fantastic to (continue/unclear
text) It’s another world I am talking about.

727
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:19,421
Hmm…

728
01:20:19,421 --> 01:20:23,261
Just close your eyes please.
