1
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:40,274
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very different
significance from any other guru puja.

2
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:56,234
When you worship your Guru you are also worshiping
the Guru within you.

3
00:03:56,234 --> 00:04:17,293
This is not in any other guru-disciple system
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has

4
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:19,964
been awakened.

5
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:31,114
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,
then this Master within you is also worshipped,

6
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:39,144
you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken
it, and you manifest it.

7
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:50,624
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

8
00:04:50,624 --> 00:05:04,774
Now, the quality of Guru, first and foremost,
is that he makes you meet God: means he raises

9
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:14,593
the Kundalini and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

10
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:24,324
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti, you make that
person meet, also, the Adi Shakti.

11
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:33,214
So you have a double advantage that, at the
same time, when you give them Realisation,

12
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:42,814
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power, but you can make them

13
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:46,424
meet the Divinity Itself, the source of Divine
Power.

14
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:55,985
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis, is
very great because in you is there is the

15
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:56,985
Guru.

16
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:05,683
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru."

17
00:06:05,683 --> 00:06:13,124
But, saying that, do we realise that: if I
am my own Guru, this “I” and “my Guru,”

18
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:20,284
between the two, what have I achieved?

19
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:24,263
Where am I?

20
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,264
Can I guide myself?

21
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:33,394
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention
so well established and manifested that I

22
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:39,174
can guide myself and guide others later on?

23
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:47,544
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important that you see to yourself – the

24
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:51,554
introspection: Can I be my own Guru?

25
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:57,234
Have I become my own Guru?

26
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:12,424
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman, so, it has to be among women that

27
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:19,754
the development of their Guru qualities have
to be very well manifested.

28
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:25,913
But it’s just the way it is not.

29
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:33,584
For them, they are still the mothers or they
are the wives or they are Sahaja Yoginis.

30
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:38,693
But they don’t realise that you are also
the Gurus.

31
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:52,174
And, because your Mother is a Guru, because
She is a woman; and you have to be also of

32
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,174
that quality, that people should say, “Look
at this woman, she’s such a Guru."

33
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:58,854
But still, as I hear from the different leaders
that the ladies are absolutely still very

34
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:05,834
much far away and are very few who can be
called as real Sahaja Yoginis.

35
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,914
It’s a sad thing to hear.

36
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:20,644
Because if you still keep to all these mundane
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of womanhood,

37
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:25,454
which has come out of domination maybe, because
of always they were shown to be something

38
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:26,454
lower.

39
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:33,514
Specially in the Christian religion they were
never regarded as something holy.

40
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:42,564
They have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand that dharma can

41
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:47,114
be established more by women than by men.

42
00:08:47,114 --> 00:09:01,754
And the Guru’s work is to establish the
dharma – in the society, in the family,

43
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:02,754
in relationships.

44
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:03,754
All these Gurus, which are representing all
these great symbols here, have done nothing

45
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,934
but have established dharma.

46
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:12,074
But, first of all, before establishing the
dharma, we should watch ourselves – have

47
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:18,364
we got dharma within ourselves or not?

48
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:32,554
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is that he listens to others, he

49
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,194
obeys.

50
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:37,884
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think, that they

51
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:42,914
have forgotten how to listen to others, how
to obey others.

52
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:50,794
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

53
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:54,824
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

54
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:58,814
First, you must learn to obey.

55
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:08,253
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast, people didn’t know what

56
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:17,484
he was born from, and he could not go directly
to any Guru.

57
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:27,914
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days, who used to go to the river

58
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:31,524
Ganges every morning to have his bath.

59
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:40,664
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,

60
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:43,224
and he touched him with his feet.

61
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:45,674
He said, “Who are you?”

62
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:50,814
So he said, “I’m Kabir, and I’m your
disciple."

63
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,384
And he caught hold of his feet.

64
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:57,354
And when he caught hold of his feet, he [Ramanand]
said, “Alright, come along!”

65
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:04,914
And then he became such a great saint in India.

66
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:09,144
People know him more than they know his Guru;
he became so great.

67
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:11,634
The basic thing is humility.

68
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:15,083
Yesterday you saw how the musician (Nishat
Khan) was humble.

69
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:18,343
All the time he was humble.

70
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,794
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

71
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:25,224
All the time he was humble.

72
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:33,854
Because in humility only you can receive the
blessings, you can receive the quality that

73
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:37,903
is of your Guru.

74
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:47,514
Now, for a Guru as you have seen that, in
My own way, in My own image, you have to come

75
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:48,824
up.

76
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:52,712
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

77
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,164
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:11:56,163 --> 00:12:00,254
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going, what is the way you live,

79
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:06,194
what is the way you are behaving.

80
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:12,594
I have seen people, who are gurus, also in
the sense that we call them leaders, or we

81
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:18,564
can call them sub-gurus, or they can not be
called as priest, but I can say ‘communication

82
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:20,124
centres’ as they are.

83
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:27,364
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

84
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:34,114
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort, always grudge about – nobody

85
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:39,714
looked after them – as if they suffer from
persecution-mania!

86
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:44,004
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

87
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:45,464
Doesn’t matter!

88
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:51,974
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely, so that you get over

89
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:54,184
this idea of hunger.

90
00:12:54,184 --> 00:13:00,064
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much, and just drinking

91
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,744
something, because just the Guru has no hunger.

92
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:10,964
Because it is in your stomach the Guru, vibrations,
are so much that you don’t feel like eating

93
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,094
anything.

94
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:16,504
So then, what do you eat and how do you eat
and all these things that we have given up

95
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,344
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

96
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:23,274
So even if leaders have this nonsense in their
head [like] what do you get to eat!

97
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:27,654
I mean, this is the basics, absolutely!

98
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:34,294
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat and how did they eat and

99
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:35,294
all!

100
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:38,313
It’s like I feel they are like tourists
in Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:44,154
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists, you
see, to see places and go round and to know

102
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:48,823
where you get, in what restaurant, you get
good food and cheaply.

103
00:13:48,823 --> 00:14:01,223
All this is so basically, absolutely not a
manifestation of Guru Principle.

104
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:06,414
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

105
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:12,654
I do not know what I eat, what they give Me,
what I want.

106
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:15,754
They go on giving Me whatever they think I
like, and I just don’t know if I like that

107
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,694
thing or not, or what is it.

108
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,364
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You have?”

109
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:25,454
I said, “What will I have, I don’t know
really, what will I have?

110
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:26,484
Anything!”

111
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,854
So there has to be no choices.

112
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:32,954
First of all not to waste your attention on
choices.

113
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,104
Of course, only on vibrations.

114
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:40,424
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

115
00:14:40,424 --> 00:14:44,664
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

116
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:50,803
But all the choices must be based on vibrations
and not on material things.

117
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:55,774
That you get something nice there, “Let’s
go there,” and they’ll travel for fifty

118
00:14:55,774 --> 00:14:58,424
miles to go eat something nonsensical.

119
00:14:58,424 --> 00:15:03,024
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja Yogis.

120
00:15:03,024 --> 00:15:06,073
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

121
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:10,544
So the food part of it is aswadha.

122
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:14,213
You should not have any taste for any special
food.

123
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:21,734
Specially in France to say that people may
not like, but French are very, very conscientious

124
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:26,164
or aware about the food part.

125
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:33,044
I don’t know how far they make really good
food, but at least they think they eat very

126
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:34,044
good food.

127
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:39,524
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a
addiction.

128
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:46,393
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug – that you must have good food.

129
00:15:46,393 --> 00:15:51,974
So Zen started this system of what they call
the tea ceremony.

130
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:59,133
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that and it’s really

131
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,584
quite a test of people.

132
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:05,934
With Me it was alright, but the rest of them
got really frightened.

133
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:13,974
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

134
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,614
and we can say [like] quinine raised to power
108!

135
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,584
It’s like that.

136
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:24,953
And they give you very nicely, handle you
with such ritual that you have to take it.

137
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:30,643
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking."

138
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:34,324
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

139
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:37,254
I don’t know how much one can achieve with
that.

140
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:44,553
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

141
00:16:44,554 --> 00:16:54,823
And to compensate it they give you something
sweet, which is again sweetness raised to

142
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:59,864
power 108, so sweet that it becomes bitter!

143
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,164
So sweet.

144
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:07,333
So this is just to conquer the tongue [that]
Zen must have thought that better give them

145
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:18,224
this tea ceremony where there is no tea, there’s
nothing but just you really give such shocks

146
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:23,554
to your tongue, so that after that you can
eat whatever you get.

147
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:29,203
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

148
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:33,844
They have solved their food problem because
they can eat anything!

149
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:44,964
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns, just peel them out like peanuts

150
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,453
and eat them like that.

151
00:17:47,453 --> 00:17:52,294
I think Zen has solved this problem for them,
because they have food shortage and this is

152
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:56,583
how they can eat everything: they can eat
the bark of the tree, they can eat the snake,

153
00:17:56,584 --> 00:18:01,874
they can eat the lizards, they can eat the
frogs, everything they can eat, so all their

154
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:10,303
eating problems are solved in that country
by Zen, I think, because you have no taste.

155
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:17,294
But in this I think the worst are, in the
whole world are Indians.

156
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:20,803
They are the fussiest people for food.

157
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:22,323
Because their women have spoiled them.

158
00:18:22,323 --> 00:18:27,284
They know very good cooking and they know
how to handle their husbands by cooking very

159
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:28,284
well.

160
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:32,803
And the way they cook food for them, you see,
the men have to go back to Indian food.

161
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:37,484
Even if they travel the whole world, they’ll
need Indian food, they can’t get over their

162
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,484
tongues.

163
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:44,323
It is such a big conditioning in India of
food that I just don’t know how will they

164
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:49,244
get out, the, absolutely, the basics which
are important.

165
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:52,224
Gandhiji tried that very much in the ashram
(laughing).

166
00:18:52,224 --> 00:19:00,744
He used to give horrid food, boiled food with
the oil of mustard on top and then nobody

167
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:02,674
could eat that.

168
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,674
Raw!

169
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,683
And he used to make everybody eat that.

170
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:12,453
Not only that, he would make them clean the
bathrooms, WC’s, everything so that you

171
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:15,874
get rid of your nose also, that you need everything.

172
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:20,143
Because so many people you will, while eating
also in India will put something to their

173
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:21,693
noses, and they smell everything.

174
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,124
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

175
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:28,374
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are not.

176
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:35,383
For eyes I would say the most sensitive people
are Japanese and Chinese and also the Western

177
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,774
people are very much sensitive because they
don’t like to see anything dirty, filthy

178
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:40,774
or ugly.

179
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:50,323
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth, anything,
just like dogs and what you call, horses or

180
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,323
buffalos!

181
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,763
They can walk through any dirt, filth – anything!

182
00:19:54,763 --> 00:20:00,534
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly, any
ugly building or an ugly dress or anything

183
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:01,534
is alright for them.

184
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,274
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

185
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:09,234
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

186
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:11,124
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

187
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:16,013
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things [which] are very

188
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,013
bad conditionings.

189
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:19,914
And the next to that are, I think, the French.

190
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:30,953
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good because there’s no taste in English

191
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:37,072
food (laughter and applause).

192
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:44,964
So, I have no problem anywhere because I think
I have no taste at all and I can eat anything

193
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:51,542
any way it is cooked, it’s alright, I don’t
bother about what is cooked, what is not cooked.

194
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:56,904
But if you have some French people for a dinner
in a restaurant they will spend forty-five

195
00:20:56,904 --> 00:21:01,603
minutes deciding what they are going to eat,
and what a waste of energy!

196
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:04,054
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

197
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,324
After all what is so great, what you are going
to eat?

198
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,324
It’s all there.

199
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,734
Just one thing that everybody should have.

200
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:14,233
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this."

201
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:19,944
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

202
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:22,303
To Me also.

203
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,383
I do not like people asking Me questions [like],
“What will You have?”

204
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:37,834
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara (laughter and applause).

205
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:55,614
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand: how much we are attached to

206
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,173
food.

207
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:58,973
And food goes in the stomach.

208
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:05,663
And not only that it spoils our guru system,
but also spoils our physical system.

209
00:22:05,663 --> 00:22:08,834
So we should try not to look at food.

210
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:15,543
That’s why fasting was told to the all the
people who wanted to develop their Gurupada,

211
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:19,173
so that they should not fast.

212
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:26,234
But they do not fast normally because they
think of food, so there’s no fasting.

213
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:31,272
I mean, fasting means that you go into nirvichara
and don’t think of food.

214
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:36,093
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning and you are just the

215
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,473
same whether you eat it or not, your mind
is eating it all the time.

216
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:48,513
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast and know where will I go to have what?”

217
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:54,042
So this is a very basic thing that we should
get rid of our habits, of our conditionings

218
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:57,973
– what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

219
00:22:57,973 --> 00:23:04,763
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that – it’s alright,

220
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:08,782
sometimes there is no salt, sometimes there’s
no sugar, doesn’t matter.

221
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:11,343
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

222
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:15,393
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,
you can live without food for days together,

223
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,084
no problem.

224
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:26,923
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

225
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:32,903
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

226
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:41,423
This is one of the things that dirties our
mind, we should say, that we think about food

227
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:45,883
all the time.

228
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:50,224
Even in Russia I found people carried all
Indian things there, they were cooking all

229
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:53,454
Indian things, and I am, poor thing, I can’t
eat anything.

230
00:23:53,454 --> 00:23:57,782
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian, but they don’t

231
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:02,304
know I am Zen – I cannot, I do not, have
sense of taste.

232
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,173
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

233
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:09,734
It’s an experiment you have to do with ourselves.

234
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:14,792
Unless and until we introspect ourselves and
do experiments we cannot rise.

235
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:19,984
Because though the Kundalini is trying her
level best, but your conditionings are so

236
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:26,743
great that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

237
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:32,704
If you see the lives of all these Gurus: they
were married, they had children, they lived

238
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:40,253
a normal life but in their own personal life
they were absolutely detached people.

239
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:46,213
So, first detachment should come from food.

240
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:49,353
And there whatever you like you just don’t
eat.

241
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:51,723
That’s the best way.

242
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,354
Because already because of liking something…supposing
if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

243
00:24:55,354 --> 00:25:00,483
He must have already spoiled his liver; so
then, give [it] up now.

244
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:03,954
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

245
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:09,313
If you like something else, just give up,
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

246
00:25:09,314 --> 00:25:13,973
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

247
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:23,113
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think, if you work it out in a sensible

248
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:24,113
way.

249
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:25,673
Just try to punish your body.

250
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:30,613
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold of first of all your body and your

251
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,613
conditionings.

252
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,363
You have to treat your body with this thing.

253
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:39,393
I am told many girls who have married abroad
are still making their Indian food and eating

254
00:25:39,393 --> 00:25:40,393
that.

255
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:41,393
It’s horrible it is!

256
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:42,444
They should starve.

257
00:25:42,444 --> 00:25:47,883
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days, then they’ll eat any

258
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,484
food in any case.

259
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:51,893
That’s why the fasting is given.

260
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:57,103
So one should adjust oneself to any kind of
food you can have.

261
00:25:57,103 --> 00:26:03,104
And if you want to survive then you eat anything,
so just make it a point that you get rid of

262
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:11,273
this very simple conditioning you have – of
liking the food that you want to eat and you

263
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,383
don’t want to have anything else.

264
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:17,653
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing, then

265
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,673
how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?

266
00:26:19,673 --> 00:26:20,673
I don’t know.

267
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:21,673
He’s very asahaj.

268
00:26:21,673 --> 00:26:23,782
Because the other day I met one lady.

269
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,243
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

270
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:29,413
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient."

271
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:32,383
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain?

272
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,383
You cannot."

273
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,383
“Why?”

274
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:36,283
“Because they asked me to make Indian food."

275
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:37,283
“Alright.

276
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:38,893
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

277
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,423
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day for a one small little thing called hing

278
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:43,423
(asafoetida)?”

279
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:46,413
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

280
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:50,954
Just to get that she had to run all over the
places to get it!

281
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:58,713
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj, whatever is available you can make

282
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:02,614
something nice out of it and eat it.

283
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:04,523
So that shows what?

284
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:11,023
It shows sagacity, shows trupti (तृप्ति
– contentment), shows your satisfaction.

285
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:14,833
And that is one of the manifestations of a
Guru that he’s a satisfied soul.

286
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,684
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t bother.

287
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:26,334
Now, for example, some people, specially in
the West, thank God, they are not spoiled

288
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,773
by their wives so much.

289
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,574
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

290
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:35,964
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour, all the Indians say, “Horrid food

291
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:41,323
was given and the poor things were eating
that horrid food and this and that."

292
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:44,643
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

293
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:45,643
They said, “Brahmapuri."

294
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:46,643
I said, “Eh?

295
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:49,493
They were saying Brahmapuri had the worst
food and everybody is complaining."

296
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:50,493
“No, no.

297
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:55,513
Brahmapuri was the best, because we could
bathe in the river and we could sing and we

298
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:56,513
could enjoy it!”

299
00:27:56,513 --> 00:28:03,563
You see, that’s the sign of one thing, to
get rid of your bad habits of food business.

300
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:09,853
Now the second part is for the body you need
comforts.

301
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:18,694
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja Yogis
that they may be coming from any walk of life

302
00:28:18,694 --> 00:28:24,623
– I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them – they may be coming from any

303
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:26,013
position or status.

304
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:33,643
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

305
00:28:33,643 --> 00:28:39,343
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got a
chair, I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t

306
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,493
got a proper things here."

307
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:49,823
In this way, you see, you will realise that
the body comfort is of no importance.

308
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:53,343
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

309
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:56,184
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep in any
case.

310
00:28:56,184 --> 00:29:01,013
If you cannot sleep for two nights, alright,
put on some music for one night or two nights

311
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:02,013
as we had here, you will sleep anyway! (laughter
and applause as everybody fell asleep during

312
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:16,292
the Nishat Khan performance the night before)

313
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:24,704
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

314
00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:34,194
But the third point where I think the Western
people falter is their materialistic attitude.

315
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:40,503
Materialistic attitude and their fondness
of their eyes.

316
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:42,743
So one of them is the worst of all.

317
00:29:42,743 --> 00:29:48,934
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have, that’s such a big blot

318
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:54,673
if you have that is to have a roving eye and
things like that.

319
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:55,673
It’s out of question.

320
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:57,743
That’s out of question for women or for
men.

321
00:29:57,743 --> 00:30:01,032
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

322
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:06,353
They have to have very clean eyes.

323
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,513
That part is alright.

324
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:12,282
And the second part is the greed, lust and
greed.

325
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:21,204
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over, but greed is still there with

326
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:24,344
so many who get lost.

327
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:30,113
So I would say Indians do not have this lust
problem, but they still have greed, greed

328
00:30:30,113 --> 00:30:38,184
problem – means they want to buy something
like a radio or some electrical stuff they

329
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,184
must buy.

330
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:40,803
If they come abroad they must buy something.

331
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:44,853
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

332
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:45,883
It should be [that attitude].

333
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:51,814
But for a Westerner, you see, he would not
like to give up his furniture, which his great

334
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:53,003
grandmother had it.

335
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:56,184
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s
so old.

336
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:57,733
If he sits on it, it will be break.

337
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:02,973
But he must keep it to show off that, “I
had a great grandmother who gave this unique

338
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:03,973
chair."

339
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:06,832
According to Indian standards it’s junk!

340
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,554
Absolute junk.

341
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:12,564
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room, nobody can sit on it

342
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:14,523
and it looks junky.

343
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:18,814
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better – whether it is a junk

344
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:23,163
or anything – he’ll have so many junks
in the house and they will sell like hot cakes.

345
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:28,373
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude towards matter that, “This will

346
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:33,113
sell like hot cakes if I sell it,” because
there must be another mad Westerner who would

347
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,584
like to buy that junk.

348
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:35,684
You see?

349
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:41,893
So this junk that you have in the house it’s
better to get rid of, because God knows how

350
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,334
many people must have used [it].

351
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,923
It’s like a grave in the house.

352
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:46,393
It’s a grave.

353
00:31:46,393 --> 00:31:49,033
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

354
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:59,653
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say – is the fad or

355
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,522
addiction of the Western people – antique.

356
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:06,324
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things so

357
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,533
Indians don’t understand the value of antiques.

358
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:14,173
They don’t understand how these people are
so mad after torn things and broken things

359
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:16,903
and dirty things and filthy things!

360
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:20,253
But the Western mind has been brought up that
way.

361
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:24,913
Now, in these antique things I have seen that,
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

362
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:28,003
and he asked Me with very great honour to
sit on his chair.

363
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:33,104
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes and there were scorpions

364
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,723
all biting Me.

365
00:32:34,723 --> 00:32:36,513
I got a fright, I got up.

366
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:37,813
I said, “What is it?”

367
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:42,944
He said, “This is from great, great, great
grandmother, you see, she gave us this thing."

368
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,824
I said, “It will break, I better sit outside."

369
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,824
(laughter)

370
00:32:46,824 --> 00:32:54,493
So this also madness of this antique is so
much that it is unbelievable how people go

371
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:55,493
into it.

372
00:32:55,493 --> 00:33:01,643
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer called as Premchand, he wrote

373
00:33:01,643 --> 00:33:10,314
about two Englishmen going on the road of
Benares when they were hit by a lota (metal

374
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:15,953
pot), that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet.

375
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,194
And it fell on their feet.

376
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:23,813
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall."

377
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:27,334
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

378
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:28,763
So he made a joke.

379
00:33:28,763 --> 00:33:29,763
But doesn’t matter.

380
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:33,522
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing and they were very angry and immediately

381
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:37,564
they took to law, “You have to come to the
courts, you have to come to the police and

382
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:41,993
we’re going to report this has fallen there,
it has hit us,” and all that.

383
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:49,102
So there was a clever man, he knew the English
or the Western mind, he said, “Sir, do you

384
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:51,773
know this, this lota has very valuable!”

385
00:33:51,773 --> 00:33:52,903
He said, “Why?”

386
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:57,453
“Because this one was used by Akbar the
Great.

387
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,623
So ancient it is.

388
00:33:58,623 --> 00:33:59,653
” He said, “Really?”

389
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:03,554
“Yes it is and, you know, you just don’t
quarrel with them.

390
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,453
And ask them for this lota."

391
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:09,363
And he told in Indian language to them that,
“I have befooled these people, I have told

392
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:19,853
them that this lota belonged to Akbar and
you have to take this lota and use this lota

393
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:23,133
to just to befool them."

394
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:27,184
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you, we’ll not take you to any courts

395
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:30,423
or anything, but you just give us this lota."

396
00:34:30,423 --> 00:34:31,903
They said, “No, we can’t."

397
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,903
He said, “Why?”

398
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,993
“Because it’s such an antique piece, you
see."

399
00:34:34,993 --> 00:34:39,522
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces, especially in Benares nobody

400
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:40,523
bothers.

401
00:34:40,523 --> 00:34:46,323
(Laughter) So they said, “Really?”, “Yes,
it belonged to Akbar and, you know, my father

402
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:48,663
was, my forefathers worked with him, so he
gave us this lota, we can’t give you, we

403
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:49,663
are sorry, you see."

404
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:55,363
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police."

405
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:58,143
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

406
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:02,033
In those days they paid one thousand rupees,
you see, this is equal to, now, one crore

407
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,383
(10 million), I think.

408
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:09,483
They gave, these English paid them and bought
that lota, which had nothing to do with Akbar

409
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,173
or anyone.

410
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:15,133
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

411
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:21,283
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

412
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:26,293
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything was
destroyed and whatever was in the olden times

413
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:30,533
was something very beautiful and good and
now we are not making very good things, perhaps,

414
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:31,564
maybe that is the reason.

415
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:35,184
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

416
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:40,214
Now in England I was surprised the old crafts
are coming up, everywhere I go the old crafts

417
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:41,342
are coming up.

418
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:48,413
So to respect antiques means you just stop
making the old craft revive.

419
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:54,684
Because you pay so much to the antiques, the
same thing made today won’t fetch the same

420
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:56,593
price as it was.

421
00:35:56,593 --> 00:36:03,253
Now this has ruined our creativity, ruined
our handwork and it has ruined our whole – I

422
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:09,042
think the quality of our life, because the
way we are mad after antiques.

423
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:15,103
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

424
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:19,473
It’s a very superficial value – if you
see to it.

425
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:23,282
Because people think that antique is something
expensive.

426
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:28,084
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt that this is expensive, that is

427
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:32,533
expensive, so it’s something great to wear
something stupid and to say that, “this

428
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,873
is antique jewellery,” and go about.

429
00:36:35,873 --> 00:36:41,663
I mean, God knows how many people must have
used it and must have worn it and what must

430
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:44,022
be the feelings of that person.

431
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:51,003
So we have to understand that this conditioning
that we have in our heads, that we must have

432
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:58,703
something antiques with us, keep something
of such value.

433
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:02,883
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

434
00:37:02,883 --> 00:37:07,723
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not written
that, “Don’t care for antiques."

435
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:12,053
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,” all other things which spoils your

436
00:37:12,054 --> 00:37:13,054
Nabhi.

437
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:14,513
They’ve written all these things.

438
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:19,434
But they have not written that, “Don’t
worry about antiques so much."

439
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:26,384
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays
and so we have to tell people that we have

440
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:27,384
to be careful.

441
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:32,183
Moreover I feel the way people have gone to
drugs and that, maybe that because they used

442
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:36,293
so much antiques that the bhoots from the
antiques must have caught them.

443
00:37:36,293 --> 00:37:40,223
Can’t understand that why people are so
melancholy, all the time crying, weeping,

444
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,453
and all that.

445
00:37:41,453 --> 00:37:48,944
So the conditionings of these matter as we
think it to be is to be absolutely taken out.

446
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:53,603
Of course, I mean in certain countries we
should say that the antique things [that]

447
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,032
were made were good and nice.

448
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:59,252
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected, [but] because of

449
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:05,733
its intrinsic value of aesthetics, it’s
alright.

450
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:09,924
But one has to see first of all the vibrations
of everything.

451
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:15,643
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not, because we have the

452
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:23,633
language of vibrations and we have to use
the language of vibrations.

453
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:29,834
Once you start using the language of vibrations
you’ll be surprised how you will get the

454
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:38,232
complete picture as to what is to be done.

455
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:45,634
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

456
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:53,814
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick: is a, sort of a,

457
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:56,692
tarnishing the name of Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:38:56,693 --> 00:39:01,784
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

459
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:09,344
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

460
00:39:09,344 --> 00:39:14,514
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see that
you get well and if there are certain problems

461
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:15,604
also – doesn’t matter.

462
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:20,404
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems, which I know, because of Sahaja

463
00:39:20,404 --> 00:39:29,774
Yoga, because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti: certain physical things

464
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:34,504
I have to face, parasympathetic working I
have to face, but I go through it!

465
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:35,504
Is accepted.

466
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:40,143
You have to accept your body as it is and
you are not to sort of say that, “I’m

467
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:44,974
not well,” and “There’s something wrong
with me,” and go on complaining like some

468
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:47,184
old hag!

469
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,893
Never think you are old, first of all.

470
00:39:49,893 --> 00:39:54,354
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

471
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:55,564
Look at your Mother.

472
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:56,844
I never think that way.

473
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:02,994
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert and listening to the music and

474
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:04,614
today I’m again alert here.

475
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:10,184
So if you have a Guru then that image should
be with you that: “Look at our Mother.

476
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:12,764
She’s so old, how much She travels, how
much She does!”

477
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:15,864
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi Shakti!

478
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:18,524
But little bit of shakti you too have.

479
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:25,034
And that shakti is to be shown by your full
dynamism.

480
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:30,673
If you have no dynamism and if you still feel
very weak that means you are not a Sahaja

481
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:31,673
Yogi.

482
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:36,983
So just ask for, ask for any amount of energy
– it can come to you.

483
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,494
That dynamism, it should be there.

484
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:44,143
Now this I would say, for the physical self
that one has to know that you are all younger

485
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:50,133
and getting younger and younger, but not the
stupidity of youth, but gravity, the gravity

486
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:52,134
of the age.

487
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:58,814
Actually I have seen children who are born
realised, they are very grave, they won’t

488
00:40:58,814 --> 00:41:01,794
do anything that is not dignified.

489
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:08,754
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of – the Sahaja Yoginis

490
00:41:08,754 --> 00:41:11,844
have a bad habit of talking, “tuk, tuk,
tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among themselves.

491
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,994
It’s a very bad habit.

492
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:17,453
Which shows that they [are] still very much
lacking.

493
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:21,264
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

494
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:22,804
First of all, what is the gravity?

495
00:41:22,804 --> 00:41:25,884
You should only speak whenever it is necessary.

496
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:31,594
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children they stand like this

497
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:32,594
before Me.

498
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:37,654
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

499
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:41,223
And say things, which you can remember all
the time.

500
00:41:41,223 --> 00:41:44,834
They just do not go on wasting anything.

501
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,953
And they are extremely obedient.

502
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:52,754
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised and the way their Guru principle

503
00:41:52,754 --> 00:41:55,354
is acting, are we also acting the same way?

504
00:41:55,354 --> 00:42:00,013
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

505
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:05,314
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard to introspect yourself, you

506
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:09,763
have missed the point that you compare yourself
with your Guru – all the time.

507
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:10,764
Now.

508
00:42:10,764 --> 00:42:17,634
Then everything has to be understood in the
right perspective that we are Sahaja Yogis.

509
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:21,514
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost thing
[is] that he has to have love.

510
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:22,514
First.

511
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:26,584
For others, not for himself.

512
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:30,453
If you are all the time worried about yourself,
“My body is such, my this thing such, and

513
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:33,864
I have to do this and that,” then you don’t
love others.

514
00:42:33,864 --> 00:42:36,534
But do you see to the comfort of others?

515
00:42:36,534 --> 00:42:40,044
Do you feel the compassion of other Sahaja
Yogis?

516
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:42,462
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for them?

517
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:43,463
What is missing in them?”

518
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:44,794
Do you work it out?

519
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:48,544
Do you go out of the way to help them?

520
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:52,104
First of all Sahaja Yogi s.

521
00:42:52,104 --> 00:42:55,703
Now Sahaja Yogis are different things.

522
00:42:55,704 --> 00:43:00,594
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis and

523
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:02,394
try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.

524
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:04,574
Is a very wrong thing.

525
00:43:04,574 --> 00:43:10,544
You belong to this new race and the people
who do not belong to this new race and if

526
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:15,623
they are attacking anybody: these are your
hands, your feet, your head, and if they attack

527
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:21,433
it, it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

528
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,672
Maybe something wrong with this person, doesn’t
matter.

529
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,274
You need not show all the fair play there.

530
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:30,344
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

531
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:35,024
Later on you may correct and you may tell
that person, “You should not have done like

532
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:36,982
this, it was wrong."

533
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:41,894
So this dignity and this understanding comes
only through silence.

534
00:43:41,894 --> 00:43:47,443
But if you are chirping all the time, talking
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,”

535
00:43:47,443 --> 00:43:50,373
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

536
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:53,943
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

537
00:43:53,943 --> 00:43:59,653
So for women now is best is to take to mauna,
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

538
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:01,524
They all the time want to talk.

539
00:44:01,524 --> 00:44:06,304
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

540
00:44:06,304 --> 00:44:10,114
They just go on talking stories, telling stories.

541
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:16,864
But if you ask them to come and speak, they
will start shaking.

542
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:20,864
How many can give speeches?

543
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:22,554
Women?

544
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:30,473
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

545
00:44:30,473 --> 00:44:34,354
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

546
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,172
Why can’t you give some speech?

547
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,173
You cannot.

548
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:39,933
If I make you stand here, you’ll be shaking,
I know that.

549
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:43,453
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you are
there.

550
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:46,544
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

551
00:44:46,544 --> 00:44:52,564
And as today is the Guru puja I have to tell
you things, not as a Mother but as your Guru.

552
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:57,513
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

553
00:44:57,514 --> 00:44:59,534
“Maunam sarvatha sadhanam."

554
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:02,764
‘Maun’ means to keep quiet.

555
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:07,983
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

556
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:10,223
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

557
00:45:10,223 --> 00:45:13,244
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

558
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:19,883
That’s your silence, that’s your right,
that’s your domain that you can keep silent.

559
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,814
Just watch that person.

560
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:26,564
If it comes then to answer, then you can answer
better.

561
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:30,074
But if somebody’s trying to attack ,you
just keep silent.

562
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:37,074
But this silence has to be established and
one should only establish by not talking too

563
00:45:37,074 --> 00:45:38,074
much.

564
00:45:38,074 --> 00:45:42,713
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

565
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:44,333
and this is very wrong.

566
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,924
You must learn the silence.

567
00:45:45,924 --> 00:45:49,334
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also were
walking out, walking in.

568
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:51,763
In the church will you do that?

569
00:45:51,764 --> 00:45:53,614
You won’t do it.

570
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:58,194
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there, but you cannot

571
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,194
do it.

572
00:45:59,194 --> 00:46:01,913
You all keep quiet, you sit there nicely.

573
00:46:01,913 --> 00:46:06,973
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there and doing all kinds of things, putting

574
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,922
the children in front like that, making them
sleep.

575
00:46:08,923 --> 00:46:09,923
Never!

576
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:15,364
Can you do that in the church?

577
00:46:15,364 --> 00:46:19,604
What a discipline people observe in that church,
which is an artificial place.

578
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:26,232
And where you are now, that kind of a silence
has to be there and that kind of understanding,

579
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:28,683
that depth, that awe has to be there.

580
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:31,233
But because we have not yet developed that
Guru thing.

581
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:34,473
If we had developed it then immediately it
will work out.

582
00:46:34,473 --> 00:46:39,094
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

583
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:52,994
So this is for our attention not to be wasted.

584
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:55,733
To discuss somebody, to discuss about others’
characters, we have no business.

585
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:58,564
Do we discuss the character of one hand to
another hand?

586
00:46:58,564 --> 00:47:03,462
To discuss about what has happened about marriages,
things like that.

587
00:47:03,463 --> 00:47:08,824
Also marriage is just…in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

588
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:12,193
Some people pay too much attention to marriage,
you see, and marriage becomes a headache.

589
00:47:12,193 --> 00:47:14,044
Also then, “What about my marriage?”

590
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:17,893
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

591
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:19,904
Again after ten minutes, “What about my
marriage?”

592
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,393
You want to run away.

593
00:47:21,394 --> 00:47:26,304
I mean, you see, it’s something becomes
like a mania for people, “What should we

594
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:27,304
do?”

595
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:31,413
And the whole thing is, all depends, and the
whole programming depends on how you are going

596
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,864
to get married.

597
00:47:32,864 --> 00:47:40,094
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you are sanyasis.

598
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:42,953
You are not married people in a way.

599
00:47:42,953 --> 00:47:47,922
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga, that’s
your husband, that’s your wife.

600
00:47:47,923 --> 00:47:51,723
And the so-called husband and wife are there.

601
00:47:51,723 --> 00:47:56,462
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

602
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:59,663
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja Yoga
to marriages.

603
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:06,784
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga, marriage was a joke; every third

604
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:14,623
day there was a divorce and people would run
away and do all kinds of things.

605
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:20,854
Then when they got married after Sahaja Yoga
they are the greatest romantic people ever

606
00:48:20,854 --> 00:48:22,232
known in the whole world!

607
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,274
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.

608
00:48:24,274 --> 00:48:25,643
I just don’t understand.

609
00:48:25,644 --> 00:48:29,264
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that, “What sort of these people are?

610
00:48:29,264 --> 00:48:34,284
I mean, they have no sense at all and the
way they go round, are they the saints?”

611
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:44,044
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that asceticism
has to be expressed in our married life.

612
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:49,804
I don’t mean that you don’t have relationship
with your husband but in a very private way.

613
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:55,973
It’s has to be extremely private and it
should not be such a great thing to go into

614
00:48:55,973 --> 00:48:56,973
romanticism.

615
00:48:56,973 --> 00:49:01,764
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in
the West if you start doing that nonsense!

616
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:07,544
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

617
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:08,544
But then you’ll fall!

618
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:09,824
That’s the first point is.

619
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:12,524
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

620
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:18,054
So this attachment and this worry about the
husband and this and that, I mean, you can

621
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:21,804
carry on with any kind of a husband and wife
if you are a Sahaja Yogi, should be able to.

622
00:49:21,804 --> 00:49:24,184
I mean, I know that’s very simple.

623
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:28,274
It’s a…your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

624
00:49:28,274 --> 00:49:30,864
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

625
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:35,213
But for that you have to have the witness
state and you have to see, you have to be

626
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:36,213
detached.

627
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:37,544
So in marriages one has to be detached.

628
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:44,683
But, on the contrary, I find that just after
the marriage they want to organise some special

629
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:51,213
thing for them to go to some sort of a honeymoon
or some sort of a thing!

630
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:53,997
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

631
00:49:53,997 --> 00:49:58,524
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things and after honeymoon they come and

632
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:00,623
say, “Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out."

633
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:04,883
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

634
00:50:04,883 --> 00:50:09,462
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say, “Mother, this, I

635
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:12,894
have started thinking and I don’t think."

636
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:19,424
I know of a lady who was jumping with a Indian
gentleman and she was on her way to Australia.

637
00:50:19,424 --> 00:50:23,922
In Singapore, she telephones that, “Mother,
I don’t think this marriage will work out."

638
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:28,483
And here everybody complained to Me, “Mother,
these two are behaving in such a manner that

639
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,723
Indians are rather embarrassed."

640
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:35,094
So the sense of shame you must learn from
Indians.

641
00:50:35,094 --> 00:50:40,994
They never… husband and wife never sit together
in India, is regarded as bad manners and it

642
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:42,334
should be with you also.

643
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:48,712
That, even in the puja, even in anything they
are sitting in the public, what is the need

644
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,643
to show your relationship in the public?

645
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:53,404
It’s only in the private.

646
00:50:53,404 --> 00:50:59,483
This is one of the things one, if you start
understanding, there will be a proper adjustment.

647
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:05,943
Men should be with men in the public, women
should be with the women together.

648
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:15,223
But the women or men, whatever they are, whatever
are their bad, bad points should not be brought

649
00:51:15,223 --> 00:51:16,223
back.

650
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:24,594
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation and they discuss

651
00:51:24,594 --> 00:51:30,433
about leadership and they, every, they get
a shock if you tell them that you are not

652
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:34,643
going to be a leader, as if they think leadership
is something very concrete.

653
00:51:34,644 --> 00:51:38,334
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

654
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:42,944
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

655
00:51:42,944 --> 00:51:47,594
And your Mother is very good at playing serious
jokes.

656
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:49,564
So be careful!

657
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,383
Don’t be childish about it.

658
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:58,263
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on and it’s just a testing point

659
00:51:58,264 --> 00:52:03,844
and if I test you wrong, you can tell Me,
but I think this has worked well, because

660
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:08,354
I can test people very well on that level
and immediately I know when the person gets

661
00:52:08,354 --> 00:52:09,973
onto the horse of ego.

662
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:18,764
So, for your mental attitude, has to be different
and our priorities have to change.

663
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:20,983
Our priorities have to change.

664
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:22,574
What are our priorities?

665
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:25,953
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

666
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:30,373
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

667
00:52:30,373 --> 00:52:32,733
If you have to punish your body, alright.

668
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:35,213
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

669
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:39,324
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.

670
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:45,784
Just introspect yourself, that is Self-realisation,
is to know yourself.

671
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:51,604
When you know yourself and know what is clinging
onto it, just to remove it completely.

672
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:53,203
Work it out the way you like.

673
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,304
Work it out the way you like.

674
00:52:55,304 --> 00:53:10,754
You see, it is very important that the body,
mind, everything should be your slaves.

675
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,433
Nothing should dominate you.

676
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,613
You should be on top of everything.

677
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:18,573
How dare your body ask for anything?

678
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:21,304
How dare your mind tells you anything?

679
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:23,644
How this conditioning works on you?

680
00:53:23,644 --> 00:53:26,463
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything."

681
00:53:26,463 --> 00:53:32,123
Like the lotuses have come out of the ponds,
you have come out of it.

682
00:53:32,123 --> 00:53:37,274
We have so many proofs to show that you are
realised souls.

683
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:42,422
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

684
00:53:42,423 --> 00:53:45,774
I can put light into you, they are all enlightened
people.

685
00:53:45,774 --> 00:53:50,064
But in My presence if you become the light,
you must carry the light outside.

686
00:53:50,064 --> 00:53:52,824
Not only in My presence, but when you go out.

687
00:53:52,824 --> 00:53:58,133
But one of the reasons, I think, when I tell
something people just start thinking about

688
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:00,652
whom Mother is talking, they never think,
“She is talking about me."

689
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:07,024
That’s the only way you can penetrate within
yourself when you see that, “Mother is talking

690
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:11,123
about me, She’s correcting me all alone
and She’s telling me."

691
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:15,074
Then only it will penetrate and it will work
out.

692
00:54:15,074 --> 00:54:21,354
The priorities have to be changed and the
first and foremost is your ascent and the

693
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:22,843
Spirit and Sahaja Yoga.

694
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:30,064
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

695
00:54:30,064 --> 00:54:40,152
Then the faith that there is this All-pervading
Power, which is looking after us, is very

696
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,153
important.

697
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,994
This time the musicians came all the way.

698
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:45,794
I must tell you the story of their travel.

699
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:51,324
They came and they said that there’s a train
from Kiev and they also bought the tickets

700
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:56,963
so got into the train and they were off-loaded
before the Hungarian border.

701
00:54:56,963 --> 00:55:02,943
They didn’t know what to do, they had no
visas, nothing and not so much money also.

702
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:03,943
They thought, “We are on the train."

703
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:09,024
They said, “No, you have to go cross over
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t know

704
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,513
where, they were standing on the road.

705
00:55:11,514 --> 00:55:16,663
And, but they were all laughing and enjoying,
“must be something in store for us."

706
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:19,844
Nobody felt that they were in trouble or in
anything.

707
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:20,844
So surrendered.

708
00:55:20,844 --> 00:55:23,834
“So, suddenly,” they said, “the custom
people came and surrounded them,” and they

709
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:28,864
said, “What’s the matter, how are you
here with all these bags and baggages?”

710
00:55:28,864 --> 00:55:30,443
So they said, “Why are you here?”

711
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:35,413
They said, “We have come for a concert and
this, and musicians we are and all."

712
00:55:35,413 --> 00:55:37,163
And some or other they started melting away.

713
00:55:37,163 --> 00:55:38,494
And then they gave them Realisation!

714
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:40,453
Six of them got Realisation.

715
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:43,652
Now can you believe: the power of love.

716
00:55:43,653 --> 00:55:49,324
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

717
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:51,633
It’s never happened with custom officers!

718
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:52,633
Imagine!

719
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:57,803
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you, the way (laughing) if you can

720
00:55:57,804 --> 00:55:59,254
do that to the custom officer!

721
00:55:59,254 --> 00:56:02,633
But it happened.

722
00:56:02,633 --> 00:56:05,482
And they came to the other side and left them
there.

723
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:06,654
Now they didn’t know what to do.

724
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:11,504
They wanted to go to Budapest, they had to
walk about two miles or something to the station.

725
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:18,344
So they were waiting there well, they said
that, “Mother, You sent maybe, two Yugoslavs

726
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:22,764
came in a big bus of 49 people – all vacant."

727
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:25,933
They stopped the bus and said, “What is
it, why are you here?”

728
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:28,672
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go."

729
00:56:28,673 --> 00:56:29,794
So they got into the bus.

730
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:34,743
When he was driving them down, they thought
of talking to him that, “Why not you take

731
00:56:34,744 --> 00:56:36,174
us to Milan?”

732
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:43,364
And they managed! (laughter) And they were
in Milan.

733
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:44,624
It’s so remarkable.

734
00:56:44,624 --> 00:56:50,994
So to have faith completely in yourself and
in that Power, which is surrounding you.

735
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:59,954
And once you have that faith you will realise
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is

736
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:07,913
so kind to you, on the same level if you think
it, it can be very harmful.

737
00:57:07,913 --> 00:57:16,754
So then never listen to the Guru ninda, means
anybody talks anything ill about your Guru,

738
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:20,913
just put your hands to your ears, absolutely
immediately.

739
00:57:20,913 --> 00:57:27,054
I have known of a person who did that [and]
got cancer, another now in jail, another one

740
00:57:27,054 --> 00:57:28,054
there.

741
00:57:28,054 --> 00:57:30,723
So anybody is saying like that, just put your
hands.

742
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:34,844
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

743
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:38,884
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

744
00:57:38,884 --> 00:57:43,433
The other day one gentleman asked Me a question,
a newsman.

745
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:46,814
He said that, “I am told you have made a
castle for Yourself."

746
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:49,564
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made
it also.

747
00:57:49,564 --> 00:57:51,113
It was a horrid place, no doubt.

748
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:54,422
But there are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,
I am not staying there.

749
00:57:54,423 --> 00:57:55,423
That’s the best part."

750
00:57:55,423 --> 00:57:56,453
But that’s all I said.

751
00:57:56,453 --> 00:58:01,453
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

752
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:03,604
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?

753
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:06,654
We want to give to our guru money and this
and that."

754
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:07,654
They never ask.

755
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:12,873
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
I have cured so many people of incurable diseases

756
00:58:12,874 --> 00:58:15,564
– I could have minted money.

757
00:58:15,564 --> 00:58:20,703
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

758
00:58:20,703 --> 00:58:24,713
So when people say like that you should say,
“Do you know how many people She has cured?

759
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:31,913
How much money She could have taken from them
if She was a doctor or She was a false Guru?

760
00:58:31,913 --> 00:58:34,744
How much money She would have made out of
all of them?”

761
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,014
Then they will understand.

762
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:39,973
You see, because they are being materialistic
they talk like that.

763
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:45,324
And their attitude is very different and so,
to tell them off is the best way.

764
00:58:45,324 --> 00:58:52,034
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed by the disciples of

765
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:53,103
the false Gurus.

766
00:58:53,103 --> 00:58:58,584
Just they cannot criticise, they cannot say
a word against such false Gurus.

767
00:58:58,584 --> 00:59:07,243
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack
that complete faith in themselves and complete

768
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,244
assertion.

769
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:11,144
Where you have to assert you must assert.

770
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:17,504
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert; must say,

771
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:19,104
“No, not possible.

772
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:20,104
It’s not!”

773
00:59:20,104 --> 00:59:24,643
But I have seen some people asking Me funny
questions who are ‘Sahaja Yogis’ also!

774
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:28,867
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

775
00:59:28,867 --> 00:59:36,983
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting somebody
who is so negative, you can’t even bear

776
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:42,774
that person and, [to them], such a person
is something great, while somebody who is

777
00:59:42,774 --> 00:59:43,774
so good they cannot make it out.

778
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:45,013
So what’s the use?

779
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:50,433
Your computer is so faulty, you’ll do…I
mean, the planes will have to run up and down

780
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:53,514
if you have such a computer as Sahaja Yogis
are!

781
00:59:53,514 --> 00:59:56,284
Because they just judge the other way round.

782
00:59:56,284 --> 01:00:01,274
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who has
got vibrations, he may be simple, he may be

783
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:06,344
unassuming, he may not be so rich, he may
not be so educated, may not be from some good

784
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:11,494
universities or anything, but you must see
the vibrations of that person!

785
01:00:11,494 --> 01:00:14,774
What sort of vibrations that person has, and
then you should judge.

786
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:21,663
Instead of that if you judge that person only
because he’s very good to talk and he talks

787
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:24,883
well and very scholarly or something like
that, that’s not the point.

788
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:25,883
The point is what are his vibrations!

789
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:32,622
And once you see those vibrations and judge
them on vibrations, then you are a Sahaja

790
01:00:32,623 --> 01:00:34,953
Yogi, otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

791
01:00:34,953 --> 01:00:36,652
But for a Guru it is very important.

792
01:00:36,653 --> 01:00:41,584
I have seen sometimes even the leaders supporting
somebody who is absolutely horrid!

793
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:45,633
I can’t bear that person even for five minutes!

794
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:51,834
But here the Guru sends him over to Me, “Oh,
Mother, he’s so good, you know, he donated

795
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:52,834
so much money."

796
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:53,834
It doesn’t matter.

797
01:00:53,834 --> 01:00:55,314
You donated money, so what?

798
01:00:55,314 --> 01:00:56,884
Who asked him to donate money?

799
01:00:56,884 --> 01:01:01,193
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

800
01:01:01,193 --> 01:01:03,314
We don’t want his bhoot!

801
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:04,314
So that’s what it is.

802
01:01:04,314 --> 01:01:08,723
So the judgment should be correct about a
person when you say that this man is not good

803
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:10,393
or that is not good.

804
01:01:10,393 --> 01:01:16,054
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught
up and then they are ambitious and if somebody

805
01:01:16,054 --> 01:01:20,603
doesn’t listen to them or somebody wants
to give a lecture at a wrong time and somebody

806
01:01:20,603 --> 01:01:24,354
says, “You shouldn’t talk like this,”
or something, then they get angry.

807
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:29,004
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

808
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:32,084
And then when people react they say, “You
are a bad Sahaja Yogi."

809
01:01:32,084 --> 01:01:33,084
That’s not the way.

810
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:41,623
First of all a guru or a leader has to be
himself a very mild, gentle, and a good person.

811
01:01:41,624 --> 01:01:46,673
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything, should not ask for anything.

812
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:48,134
Never demand anything!

813
01:01:48,134 --> 01:01:53,514
Anybody who demands can not be a guru.

814
01:01:53,514 --> 01:01:56,953
Respect is to be commanded and not to be demanded.

815
01:01:56,953 --> 01:02:05,413
And so, everything works out well if you understand
that – once you rise in your ascent, in

816
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:10,064
your wisdom, in your awareness and in your
Spirit – automatically all these things

817
01:02:10,064 --> 01:02:11,064
happen!

818
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:15,743
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything, you don’t

819
01:02:15,744 --> 01:02:18,223
have to complain for anything, everything
works out.

820
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:22,524
You are looked after by all the ganas, by
all the angels.

821
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:23,763
They are there.

822
01:02:23,764 --> 01:02:25,304
You are on the stage.

823
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:27,163
But if you are halfway then they play tricks
with you.

824
01:02:27,163 --> 01:02:33,613
You see, they play tricks, they make you falter,
you have problems, you go here, you go there,

825
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:38,172
all these things happen and then you say,
“Mother, how is it this happened?”

826
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:43,664
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you and they make problems for

827
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:46,463
you just to make you understand that you are
doing wrong.

828
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:53,074
So we are on a stage where there’s a beautiful
security, everything is there and we have

829
01:02:53,074 --> 01:02:59,254
to give to the world such a great thing like
Sahaja Yoga, which is for the emancipation

830
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:04,564
of the whole world, as you realise, and so
also I hope you realise your responsibilities.

831
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:10,643
There are so many things one has to understand,
how one has to be as a guru, how he has to

832
01:03:10,643 --> 01:03:13,004
act and how he has to work out.

833
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:18,373
Now I have given so many lectures on Guru
things, but, for today’s lecture, only I

834
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:26,703
have to say that, first thing, to have a guru
system, you must have complete humility.

835
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:36,494
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

836
01:03:36,494 --> 01:03:39,883
You cannot take liberties with Me.

837
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:41,154
You cannot take.

838
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:46,422
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

839
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:50,113
A disciple has to keep a distance from the
Guru.

840
01:03:50,113 --> 01:03:54,803
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time, sit there for hours together,

841
01:03:54,804 --> 01:03:56,393
chit-chat with Me – nothing!

842
01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,504
You have no right.

843
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:04,775
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

844
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:08,683
Then you should not force things on the Guru
that, “Please, come and listen to this,”

845
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:11,363
or, “Do this!” that should not be said.

846
01:04:11,363 --> 01:04:17,212
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be these music programs or everything

847
01:04:17,213 --> 01:04:18,213
arranged.

848
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:23,973
So we have to report everything to your leader,
or to Me, all those things that you want to

849
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:24,973
do.

850
01:04:24,973 --> 01:04:25,973
And it should be really transparent.

851
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:30,044
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing, and this hand knows everything

852
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:31,232
that this hand is doing.

853
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:34,254
In the same way everybody should know each
other.

854
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:38,883
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

855
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:44,732
This I’m just telling you because also I
found out that there are certain jealousies.

856
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:52,504
And when they talk there is a little bit of,
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this."

857
01:04:52,504 --> 01:04:58,064
When they enjoy each other’s company because
they have reached a certain state and they

858
01:04:58,064 --> 01:05:00,614
understand, “This is the state we are in."

859
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:05,254
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other much more than anybody

860
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:09,363
else – the guru’s company.

861
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:18,564
All the company of the leaders, if they enjoy
each other and there’s no jealousy, there’s

862
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:23,172
no fight, there’s no problem but just the
enjoyment of the company, then they should

863
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:24,574
know that they have become a guru.

864
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:26,834
Now all of them never fought with each other.

865
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:27,834
They supported.

866
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:31,823
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

867
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:37,953
But only the satanic people – they’ll
fight among themselves, not the godly.

868
01:05:37,953 --> 01:05:45,784
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul or who is an Incarnation,

869
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:46,843
but never against themselves.

870
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:52,692
It’s very surprising that the satanic people
though they fight among themselves, there

871
01:05:52,693 --> 01:05:56,183
are jealousies, they’ll never talk of each
other.

872
01:05:56,183 --> 01:05:59,674
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we have
freedom.

873
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:04,413
But freedom is not abandonment, is the freedom
with complete rules and regulations of the

874
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:10,014
Divine, with us, and we have to know them
that this is the Divine Law.

875
01:06:10,014 --> 01:06:16,277
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane, and we all have

876
01:06:16,277 --> 01:06:17,963
to land into the beautiful area.

877
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:29,764
But first of all we have to develop that humility
in your heart; complete humility and surrender,

878
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:30,764
that’s very important.

879
01:06:30,764 --> 01:06:34,764
Unless and until you have that humility and
surrender in your heart, Guru principle can

880
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:36,074
not be awakened.

881
01:06:36,074 --> 01:06:40,683
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

882
01:06:40,683 --> 01:06:43,734
So you have to develop that humility.

883
01:06:43,734 --> 01:06:49,774
And that humility comes very easily if you
love Me, respect Me.

884
01:06:49,774 --> 01:06:50,794
It’s not only love, but respect.

885
01:06:50,794 --> 01:07:00,844
That respect has to be there and then people
will respect you.

886
01:07:00,844 --> 01:07:02,844
May God bless you
