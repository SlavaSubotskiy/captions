May 10, 1985

3
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,730
I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I’ve
told you before that these are special times,

4
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:14,880
and times when we are very confused. We are
confused because so many things are in the

5
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:30,049
atmosphere. Moreover there is a special urge
to search the truth. This is a very special

6
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:40,899
thing of the modern times that people want
to search the truth. They think perhaps that

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
there is something beyond that they have to
seek. They feel they are not satisfied with

8
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,159
whatever they have. They feel whatever is
going on in this world is not all right. Perhaps

9
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:10,789
they feel that human beings are not on the
right track, that we have to take to something

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
else, something different, something higher.
But first of all when we are seeking, we must

11
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,510
understand that it should be based on the
tradition of seeking. For example, when you

12
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,700
see these lights here you know that it was
discovered gradually, first through principles

13
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,060
then little more then little more, till they
discovered these lights for us. But in the

14
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,320
seeking, today the problem is human being
has become not independent, but arbitrary.

15
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:09,250
He has no relationship with the whole, and
anybody who tries to find out a new method,

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,400
a new idea, a new way, people jump at it.
This is the character of the modern times.

17
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Also media and everybody tries to support
anything new comes up. In seeking also it

18
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,260
has happened. Whatever the ancient people,
the scriptures have found out for us is not

19
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,710
to be wasted. We have to base our findings,
our path, on the same experiences that they

20
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,730
have had and use them for our purpose, is
a sensible thing. Like a boy gets a lot of

21
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,960
money, say from his parents, he uses that
and then builds up his own business, very

22
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:17,090
rarely he’ll throw away all that and start
something new venture and end up into bankruptcy.

23
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,940
This is one of the problems we are facing.
So I have seen that people suddenly take to

24
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,570
new methods. Like I was in Pune the other
day and I met some very learned Sanskrit scholars,

25
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,520
and I was amazed that they all were suffering
from all kinds of diseases of a very serious

26
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,520
nature. They said we have a guru, another
said he had a guru.

27
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:02,670
I said, “How is it you are suffering from
diseases? If you have a guru at least your

28
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,660
health should be all right, at least minimum
of minimum.”

29
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,910
“Oh,” they said, “No, this is something
we are doing, very serious work.”

30
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,570
I said, “What is that?”

31
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:21,570
They started giving Me names Urnopait, Turnopait,
this, that. They said that our guru gives

32
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,560
us a shaktipath.

33
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,560
I said, “What is all that I have never heard
it. In what book have you found it? Is it

34
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,560
in Vedas? Is it in Puranas? Is it in the Gita?
Or is it in the Bible or Koran, where is it?

35
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:44,990
Did Lao Tse talk about it or Socrates? From
where do you get this word shaktipath suddenly?

36
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,889
I’ve never heard about it.”

37
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,210
So they said about sixty, seventy years back
there was a gentleman called Vishnutirth,

38
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,500
he has written a book, a book, and all this
is based on that shaktipath business.

39
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,500
I said, “I have never heard of this Vishnutirth.”
And he started a new fad, and this fad you

40
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,550
have accepted; paying no attention to what
Gita has to say, no attention to what Vedas

41
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,110
have to say, no attention to what other scriptures
have to say about your ascent. You accepted

42
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,040
this gentleman out of the blue. Last hundred
years in India we have had such funny people,

43
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:39,460
they produced books after books, even in English
language. All these books were translated

44
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,650
in English, German and all these languages
which has no basis, no connection, no relevance

45
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,110
whatsoever to the ancient books.

46
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,110
I read a book by one German fellow who must
have taken some, I don’t know, idea from

47
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,810
half baked personalities in India, somebody
who knows little bit of Sanskrit and lot of

48
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,350
English or maybe something, he wrote such
a funny book where he said the kundalini is

49
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,949
in your stomach. And this fellow says when
the kundalini is awakened then you start jumping

50
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:19,169
like a frog, or you start making noises like
a lion.

51
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:26,169
I said, “Now, are you going to become a
frog and then an earthworm?” All these funny

52
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:33,580
ideas are worked out. Maybe it is an ego trip
or maybe it’s some sort of a befooling going

53
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,900
on. The other day only, I met somebody in
Germany; there were thirty people in a group

54
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,330
and their so-called teacher came to see Me,
and they all. And I said, “What are you

55
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,580
teaching them?”

56
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:52,650
He said, “I am teaching them Prana moksha.”

57
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,380
In Sanskrit language this word means death.
I was quite shocked, what is he teaching there?

58
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,900
I said, “What sort of a Prana moksha are
you teaching them?”

59
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,630
He said, “I circulate the air into my body
and then I make the air go here and there.”

60
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,729
So I said, “What difference will it make
if the air goes here or there or here or anywhere,

61
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,770
what difference is it going to make?”

62
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,770
But he was quite confident about it. He said,
“You must give me more time. I’ll talk

63
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,940
to You about it.”

64
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,630
His kundalini was all frozen, absolutely,
he had no realization, nothing, and he was

65
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,769
boasting as if he knew every thing about it.
I was amazed at his confidence, really, and

66
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:40,300
I said that these thirty people tomorrow will
be suffering from horrible diseases or they

67
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:47,300
might end up in a lunatic asylum. It may be
some of the seekers might have reached a state

68
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,990
that they are so frustrated with all this
nonsense, that they might be wanting just

69
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,709
to kill themselves. They might have joined
him for this Prana moksha. I can’t understand,

70
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,110
why did they join this nonsensical thing?

71
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:11,110
So, it is in India also we have such people
who take to new things, even in Western countries

72
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,680
we are finding all kinds of new things coming
out. Like we have now, say Christ came in,

73
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,680
now as soon as Christ came there was an attack
on Christianity. As I told you last time,

74
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:32,639
Paul. Paul came to attack Christianity, absolutely
he is anti-Christ man, because he just neutralized

75
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,860
Christ in his writings. When I first saw him
there I said, “Who is this Mr. Paul here,

76
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,860
what is he doing?” And he cannot understand
the mystery of God. He cannot think what greatness

77
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:55,129
God’s powers are. How can he describe? He
himself was epileptic, according to us that

78
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:02,430
means he was a possessed man. Not only epileptic,
he had other problems. He had killed many

79
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:10,519
Christians and suddenly he becomes a very
nice man. Same with Augustine, he was another

80
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:16,660
attack. Now thank God that Paul is exposed,
and now we have two types of Christians, those

81
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:23,660
who believe in Christ and those who believe
in Paul. You cannot intellectualize. No, you

82
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,970
cannot intellectualize Christ. You cannot
intellectualize God, you cannot, He is beyond

83
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,529
your intellect, you cannot understand Him
through your intellect. If you have to understand

84
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,110
him you have to become the spirit.

85
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,869
Christ has clearly said that you are to be
born again. And when Nicodemus asked, “How

86
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:49,869
am I to be born again, I have to enter into
the womb of my mother?” Christ said, “No,

87
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:57,569
that what is flesh will produce flesh. You
have to be born again by the Holy Ghost.”

88
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,240
If you remember Christ was killed in no time;
if was given time He would have told you what

89
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,619
Holy Ghost is. Holy Ghost is the Kundalini
within. She is going to give you the second

90
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:17,619
birth. It’s a living process, and a living
process that should take place spontaneously.

91
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:26,439
All living processes take place spontaneously.
It is not that you can make a seed sprout

92
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:34,470
by taking out, pulling out its primule. You
cannot force it. You cannot put some sort

93
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,470
of a yoga system on that seed that it should
sprout. It has to just be embedded in the

94
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,519
Mother Earth, and the Mother Earth has the
capacity and it sprouts.

95
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,879
So all these new ideas come in and for an
intellectual, he being a right-sided person,

96
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:02,420
it’s a great thing to see something new.
And that’s why sometimes people of My age

97
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,119
group here in England are quite shocked to
see how things have changed in this short

98
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:14,550
time. How people have taken to absurd things.
Why have they accepted this kind of absurdity

99
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,439
and even the law goes in their favor, because
law has to be democratic, it has to accept

100
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:25,290
whatever people say. Tomorrow if many people
decide to commit suicide the law will say,

101
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,689
all right, by law you are allowed to commit
suicide. What can the law do? They allow all

102
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:38,689
kinds of nonsensical perverted sexual behavior,
and in ‘73 when I went to America I told

103
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:43,749
them there will be a horrible disease coming
in which will stop all this nonsense. And

104
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:48,559
they were very angry with Me, nobody would
listen to Me.

105
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,379
But other gurus said, “It’s all right,
that’s your culture, do what you like, we

106
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:58,749
have nothing to say. Only thing, as long as
you give us money we are satisfied. Nothing

107
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:03,029
more is wanted for you to do, you do, that’s
your culture, this is our culture.”

108
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,989
Even lamas say that, lamas when they come
down all the way from there, they are only

109
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:12,629
interested in taking money from here. They
said, that’s your culture, this is our culture;

110
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:17,899
as if Christians had a culture which was nothing
to do with righteousness, nothing to do with

111
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:24,899
virtue, nothing to do with purity. Was that
a animal’s culture that was preached here?

112
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:34,179
But that’s what people accepted, because
they just wanted your money.

113
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:40,509
It’s a spontaneous process, you cannot pay
for it. And once you understand this simple

114
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:47,509
point that you cannot pay for it, is a spontaneous
thing, it is your own, it is within your being,

115
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,869
that this kundalini resides. And it resides
in such a way that it notes everything that

116
00:13:53,869 --> 00:14:00,869
you do, it’s like a tape recorder. It’s
your mother, and she is never going to harm

117
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,980
you, but she knows about her child. She is
your individual mother, and she is the pure

118
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:15,980
desire within you. All other desires are impure
desires. It’s an energy, an energy which

119
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:24,179
is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, because
Holy Ghost is the energy of God, which is

120
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:31,179
all-pervading. This energy resides in the
triangular bone, and the Greeks knew about

121
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:38,549
it because they called the bone as sacrum.
This all your own, you don’t have to go

122
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:43,360
any where else to find God.

123
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,360
(Let her have a chair, get her a chair here,
she wants to come closer to Me, this little

124
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:13,009
child. All right, please be seated. She’s
a born-realized person. How are you?)

125
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:27,569
So, these great things are available to you,
at your command you have got it, and the times

126
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:40,660
have come, so many people have to get realization.
But not through your mental projections, not

127
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:48,110
through your understanding you can understand
the miracles of God; you cannot. Must understand

128
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,949
very humbly that we have to go beyond, we
have to become the spirit. As Krishna has

129
00:15:54,949 --> 00:16:01,410
said, Atman Nivatman Atushda. That is: through
atma only the atma will know. That is: the

130
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,589
spirit will know itself through the spirit.
Is a simple thing to be understood that we

131
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,819
are not yet the spirit, and we have to become
the spirit. That’s what Christ has clearly

132
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:17,230
said it. Because people did not become the
spirit, now they are challenging Him. They

133
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:23,759
are challenging His miracles. To see His miracles,
one thing is that you have to be the spirit.

134
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,970
Now all that is within you, in your own power.
It’s all there, you have to just get it

135
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,410
awakened, and you become that. Once you become
the spirit, you become the light and then

136
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:41,410
you can give realization to other people.
Now the people when they are skeptical, and

137
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,519
they start doubting, I think there is nothing
to doubt. You are doubting yourself. Because,

138
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:55,519
you are not to pay anything here. You are
not to do anything but to get your realization,

139
00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:02,989
that’s all, very simple. Why should you
doubt? Because your brain is such that you

140
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:09,989
doubt the right and never the wrong. So please
tell your mind that just now wait for a while,

141
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:20,510
let me become the spirit. Then the same mind,
you’ll be surprised, the same mind will

142
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,059
communicate to you, what you have achieved
and what you have got.

143
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:34,059
But as a result of spiritual ascent what do
you get, that’s the main point is, what

144
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,250
should happen to us? So the first thing happens
to us is that we become, again I say you become

145
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:48,799
on your central nervous system, collectively
conscious. That is on your fingertips you

146
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,799
can feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.
You can feel the centers of another person,

147
00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:03,139
on your fingertips you can feel it. You can
know about your own centers, you can know

148
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,440
about the center of others. That is one thing
that happens to you, that you become collectively

149
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:20,510
conscious. I say you become, it’s no certificate
by anybody else, but you yourself can find

150
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:27,630
out that a new awareness has come on your
chakras and you can feel it. That you can

151
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:42,700
feel what’s wrong, particularly, in a particular
place within your being, also you know how

152
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,679
to cure it, how to put it right, how to make
all right. This is the first thing you get

153
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:58,250
as a knowledge of collective consciousness.
Your attention becomes enlightened because

154
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,309
you become aware of yourself and of others.

155
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:11,309
Now this awareness is very good word in English
language if you understand. Human beings are

156
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,980
much more aware than the animals. Where? On
the central nervous system. Whatever we have

157
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,659
achieved in our evolution is on the central
nervous system. So whatever has to happen

158
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:31,659
to you has to be on the central nervous system,
so that you achieve the epitome of your evolution.

159
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,360
From amoeba you have become the human being
and now you have to become the higher being,

160
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:46,450
not a frog or an earthworm, but a higher being
who can feel another personality and your

161
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,429
own personality. And then you have to know
how to cure it.

162
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,600
What I do is nothing, is just like a light,
which is enlightened, can enlighten another

163
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,149
light, that’s all. You are all ready and
the another light gets enlightened. So your

164
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:12,019
ego should not feel challenged at all. There
should be no fear that you are obliged to

165
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:17,769
Me or there is some obligation on you, nothing
of the kind. This is the first thing happens

166
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:24,700
to you, then the second thing happens that
you become aware that you are a part and parcel

167
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,700
of the whole. Because you start feeling another
person within you. You start understanding

168
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:39,950
another person within you, not mentally, but
on your vibrations. So you understand which

169
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:47,929
part of your being is not all right and which
part is all right. For example, if somebody

170
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,730
gets cured through Sahaja Yoga and he tries
to thank Me for that, or thank anyone for

171
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:00,370
that, there’s nothing to thank. Because
who is the other? Supposing this hand is feeling

172
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,370
the pain, the another hand soothes it like
that, it’s doing no obligation on this hand.

173
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,039
It’s happening automatically because there
is nobody who is the other. So this is the

174
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:22,039
second thing happens to you, that you feel
conscious, aware that you are part and parcel

175
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,259
of the whole.

176
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:32,259
Then you know the truth, what is the truth?
The truth is that you are the light, that

177
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:42,630
you are the spirit. Now many people see the
light and they say we have seen the light

178
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,269
now we have become the light. If you become
the light do you see the light? You see the

179
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:55,630
light when you are away from the light. If
you see the light, then it is not that you

180
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,880
have become the light, but you are seeing
the light, that means it is away from you.

181
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,880
So we must have a full idea as to what is
the light within ourselves. When we have light

182
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:12,070
within ourselves we see ourselves clearly
and others clearly. And understand ourselves

183
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,799
and understand others. And in that light,
if you have the knowledge how to cure, how

184
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,799
to improve, how to cleanse yourself and others
then you are the light. And that’s what

185
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,389
exactly happens to you.

186
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:35,389
Then the spirit is the source of compassion
and you become extremely compassionate and

187
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,960
discreet, because you know which person is
all right, which person is not all right.

188
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,799
For example a person is there who may be a
thug, he is cheating, and he says, “I am

189
00:22:53,799 --> 00:23:00,799
a great saint.” How are you to find out?
Only through vibrations, because you become

190
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:07,000
like a computer which is connected. If the
computer is not connected then it cannot say,

191
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,809
it is indiscreet, but once it is connected,
all the programming is done in you, you start

192
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:19,210
working it out and you know exactly what that
sort of a person is. As soon as you know that

193
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,799
person, you know what should be done about
it. Even if the person is dead, even if he

194
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,799
is far away you can find out about that person
and also if he is a great saint, a great personality,

195
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,139
you enjoy it. Even you enjoy the people who
are around you, whom you have missed, you

196
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:44,830
never knew about them. So that first time
the rapport is established between human beings

197
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,130
of a very pure nature.

198
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,419
Normally there is some lust, some greed, some
sort of a relationship that exists. Here is

199
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:59,990
a pure relationship of enjoyment, every human
being is a source of joy when he becomes the

200
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,570
spirit. As soon as he becomes the spirit you
start enjoying him as a spirit and he also

201
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:12,279
enjoys you as a pure spirit. There is no lust,
no greed, nothing of the kind. Nothing common,

202
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:17,960
like two drunkards are great friendly people,
one of them gives up alcohol then there is

203
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,399
no friendship. Two nations will say we are
brothers, brothers, and when it comes to reality

204
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:28,429
you’ll find they are the ones fighting with
each other. It can happen to two own brothers,

205
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:35,429
born of the same parents, it can happen to
anyone. But once you born of your spirit,

206
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,440
you feel the oneness that all cells belong
to one great being. Microcosm becomes the

207
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:52,169
macrocosm and you do not feel that separateness
from another personality as you all the time

208
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:58,399
feel you have fear, you have apprehensions,
you are bothered. But once you become that

209
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,929
you trust and you know that another one is
a great human being.

210
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,690
Only the human beings are the ones who have
created atomic bombs to kill each other. No

211
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:14,519
animals have done like this. Only the human
beings have a great capacity to destroy each

212
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:20,750
other. But all these ideas of destruction
of others goes away and you think of constructing

213
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:26,360
everyone into a beautiful way, without aggressing
anyone, without torturing anybody, without

214
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,190
trying to show off. It’s just automatically
works out and this compassion is the compassion

215
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:39,879
which doesn’t talk. It’s a silent compassion
which emits from such a personality and when

216
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:46,879
it emits, it acts, it works, it doesn’t
talk. Such a person, even with a glance, can

217
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:55,860
make a person peaceful, can bring joy to that
person, can reconcile many broken hearts,

218
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,370
can do wonders, can cure lepers, can cure
people suffering from horrible diseases. Because

219
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:11,370
joy, which we talk of, has got its own powers
and one of the greatest powers of joy is that

220
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,840
it is the truth and it is the compassion.
Is the absolute, it is the absolute and that’s

221
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:27,019
how you do not have any more confusions in
your minds because the relative world disappears

222
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:33,100
and everything gets related to the absolute
that is your spirit. And this is what you

223
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,960
are. You are the spirit. Only thing you have
to just become and that becoming is a very

224
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,899
easy thing that should happen to you.

225
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:46,690
Some people must have read some books where
they must have heard that it’s not such

226
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:53,690
a easy thing. You have to do lots of cleansing
yourself and you have to go to Himalayas or

227
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,149
some sort of a Gobi desert to take your mokshas.
In any case, if you go to Himalayas or to

228
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:09,149
Gobi desert you get your mokshas all right.
There is nothing to try anymore. But, it is

229
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:18,149
that whatever is vital, you have to get it
easily. You breathe so easily, you digest

230
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:27,240
your food so easily, you don’t have to go
to a guru or to anyone to get it. So whatever

231
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,580
is vital has to happen easily and that’s
why you have to get it very easily. Now you

232
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,889
may say, “Why you are there Mother, what
are you doing there? If we have to get it

233
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:44,889
why not we get it directly?” You cannot,
because it cannot talk. It does not have words

234
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:51,860
and somebody has to decode it for you. After
decoding you must, like scientist, accept

235
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,759
Me just as a hypothesis and then see for yourself
if it is true or not. You should not just

236
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,990
discard it because I am saying so or you should
not accept it because I am saying so, but

237
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,190
as scientist keep your mind open and see for
yourself, if it works you must accept. If

238
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,259
you are honest you will but if you are dishonest
you will not.

239
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,059
Of course this is not meant for frivolous
people who want to waste away their life,

240
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:25,059
who want to go towards destruction. God is
not going to fall at their feet. He selects,

241
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,679
in a way He does select, and you yourself
were into this selection. You yourself are

242
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,029
found out in this selection. So it is for
you to understand that it is meant for true

243
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:44,049
seekers, seekers of truth who are really seeking
God and not for people who are just doing

244
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:49,639
it out of fashion. I used to get some people
because they couldn’t get admission into

245
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:55,730
some other lecture so they would come to Me.
But some of them would get realization, despite

246
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:02,730
that, just by chance also they got realization.
But such people are not serious people, they

247
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,559
do not develop their realization further and
they end up with some problems. And after

248
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,029
one year they’ll appear saying that I have
got this problem and that problem. But this

249
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:18,749
is a science of complete understanding of
the divine laws, how they work out, and once

250
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:25,749
you know that you’ll become a master, master
of yourself. So this source of joy, which

251
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:32,649
is the spirit, must be achieved and must be
enjoyed. If we do not become that, we have

252
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:34,960
missed the real point. That’s what it is.

253
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Now there are many people who also come down
with new ideas, this is so, that is so, but

254
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:47,210
one should understand that why do you want
represent anyone here. Why don’t you become

255
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,200
yourself? You need not represent some other
cult, some other gurus, better be yourself.

256
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,200
What have you got so far? It just takes a
second for you to get realization, what is

257
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,720
the need for you to represent some other people
because you have paid some money there or

258
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,440
because you are member of some organization.
You cannot be a member of Sahaja Yoga, you

259
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,139
have to become.

260
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:16,970
First you have to become a person with thoughtless
awareness, which we call in Sanskrit Nirvichar

261
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,440
Samadhi, and after that you become a person
endowed with doubtless awareness, which we

262
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,440
call as Nirvichar Samadhi This must be achieved,
otherwise no use coming to Sahaja Yoga. Because

263
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,600
we do not want just majority, nobody is fighting
elections here, it is for your gain. If you

264
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,759
do not want to achieve that state, no use
being here because it’s just a waste of

265
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:53,340
time for us and for you. You should just understand
that this is your right to have it, you must

266
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:59,009
get it and you must learn how to preserve
it. And then you have to give it to others.

267
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:04,840
You have to use it for helping others. For
the emancipation of the whole humanity, for

268
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,049
the saving of the whole humanity. There may
be very few, doesn’t matter, but they have

269
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,080
to be genuine and truthful people.

270
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,259
If you are interested in money, by getting
some money in Sahaja Yoga, there are some

271
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:21,659
people before they came in Sahaja Yoga, wanted
to make money out of it. Then we found some

272
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:28,659
people who were having power games. All this
is not going to help. What is going to help

273
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,350
us is our genuine effort to know the truth,
that’s all. Otherwise all other things are

274
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:42,350
of no avail and no help to us or to you. That’s
the only thing that we expect you to have,

275
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:51,139
is a genuine understanding that it is what
you have which we have to give you, and which

276
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:57,100
you have to take it, and then give it to others,
what they have. Is a very simple thing, like

277
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,840
one light can enlighten many lights and all
those many lights can enlighten innumerable

278
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,730
lights. And the time has come and there is
no need to waste any more time about it. I

279
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,860
hope today again we’ll have many people
get their realization.

280
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,710
But you should not get lost. After getting
realization people get lost, and I think Christ

281
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:28,710
has already described a parable where some
seeds got sprouted and got lost. So that sort

282
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:35,610
of a thing should not happen, we should have
the seeds which become the trees. And you

283
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,619
can, you are quite capable of it because you
have been seekers of ages, not of today. So

284
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:48,619
you must utilize what you have had today.
You must cash it, it’s your own, and as

285
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,490
your Mother I’m very anxious that I better
deliver the goods to the right people, whatever

286
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:01,490
belongs to you I must give you. That’s how
I’m traveling, today only I came from Austria

287
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,559
and I will be again going to Italy. And I
find in Italy specially people are extremely

288
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:16,210
sensitive, extremely sensitive. The municipality
itself has come forward to help us and they

289
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,889
are the ones who are paying for all our halls
and for our advertisement.

290
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:26,340
I don’t know that is possible in English
municipality. I don’t know if they’ll

291
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,529
have that much of awareness here. But doesn’t
matter, let’s hope for the best, doesn’t

292
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:35,470
matter. Whatever it is we, I think if you
all people get your realization and establish

293
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:42,470
it I am sure one day will come that we’ll
have to make this great country into Jerusalem.

294
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,799
Is already prescribed by William Blake, and
He must have seen the future of England as

295
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:58,460
something great, that’s why He wrote it,
because He was a very great seer. And we have

296
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,119
lots of proof of that, that He was a great
seer and whatever He has said has become the

297
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:10,679
truth. I’ve been here in England for the
last eleven years now, and maybe some more

298
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:16,060
years I may be here, but then I have to go
back to India. Before that I hope in England

299
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,850
we’ll be able to establish something really
substantial.

300
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,399
May God bless you all.

301
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,290
The question part we have decided not to have
because it wastes your time, but if you have

302
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:36,820
any questions you can write to Me, and I’ll
answer them. That is much better because mostly

303
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,820
these are individual questions, nothing collective,
so is better not to disturb everyone by questions.

304
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,600
If you have any problems you may write to
Me, you have got address, and I’ll definitely

305
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,600
answer you, and I’ll try to do whatever
is possible. Thank you.

306
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:12,130
Now we will have the experience, which is
a very simple thing; but we are not very simple,

307
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,560
we are quite complicated. So in a simple place,
like I went to Himalayas, the foothills of

308
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,040
Himalayas. Very simple people from the village
came, and it was said that they call the Kundalini

309
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,430
as the Devi, is the Goddess: “the Goddess
will be awakened.” They came from twenty

310
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:46,070
miles walking down, and in a valley we had
a program, and thousands were there. And they

311
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:51,900
all got realization, and they got established,
I didn’t have to do much about them. Very

312
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,590
simple people. And traditionally they know
what it is, waiting for this day. So, because

313
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:05,560
we are little complicated we have to help
ourselves. And so it might take little more

314
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,040
time, doesn’t matter, we must have patience
with ourselves. For this experience I have

315
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,460
to say that those who do not want to do it
should go away, because they shouldn’t disturb

316
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,140
others. To be civil and kind to others should
go away, and should not suddenly get up and

317
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,420
walk out, or suddenly open your eyes. If you
want to go away, you can go away. But if you

318
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:32,420
want to stay you are welcome to stay, but
you have to do the way we tell you, because

319
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:52,380
it cannot be forced upon you.

320
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:13,010
Now, you will all have to close your eyes,
so you need not have your spectacles, because

321
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,570
it also helps your eyesight. And you have
to take out your shoes, because this Mother

322
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:32,570
Earth helps us a lot to suck out our problems
due to the matter. Best is to take out your

323
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:44,940
spectacles, because your eyesight improves.
Many a times it does help. And moreover, the

324
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,580
attention has to be withdrawn inside. But
if your eyes are open then the attention goes

325
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:57,580
out. So, best thing is to take out your shoes
and your spectacles, and any sort of a tight

326
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:05,660
thing which makes you, I would say, little
uncomfortable. Anything tight anywhere which

327
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:14,560
makes you uncomfortable should be loosened,
that’s all. Both the feet should be on the

328
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,860
Mother Earth straight, like that. In case
you are sitting on the ground it’s all right,

329
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:29,860
but if you are not sitting on the ground,
the best thing is to put both the feet on

330
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,870
the Mother Earth. And the shoes, please keep
them at the back, would be better than to

331
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,770
keep it on the sides. At the back. You should
not touch them. And now put your feet away

332
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:44,620
from each other a little bit, parallel on
the ground.

333
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:51,620
At the very outset I have to say that we have
to be very pleasantly placed within ourselves,

334
00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:01,370
because we are going to enter into the Kingdom
of God. So, we should be very pleasant about

335
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,440
it, and we should forgive ourselves. We should
not have guilt of any kind, of any kind whatsoever.

336
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,440
This is one of the biggest obstacles of the
West, that everybody has some sort of a nonsensical

337
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,020
thing called guilt, which I do not understand.
Even for a small thing we build up a guilt,

338
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:32,930
because the norms are so strong here that
people who do not do some small thing like

339
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:39,640
wearing a proper shoe also feels guilty. It’s
very absurd to feel guilty. When you are a

340
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:46,470
human being, that means God has accepted you,
chosen you to be a higher personality. So

341
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:53,470
you should not have any guilt at all. Apart
from that, Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,

342
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:01,010
and you cannot commit mistakes in such a way
that Divine cannot forgive. So please first

343
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:08,160
of all forgive yourself, have respect yourself,
because you are the temple of God. Only the

344
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,120
light has to be brought in, that’s all.
So you must have respect for yourself.

345
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Now, the left hand is the power of your desire,
and kundalini is the power of pure desire.

346
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:34,050
So you put your desire on your hand like this
towards Me. That is the expression that you

347
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:41,850
are desiring to have your realization, all
the time. And the right hand has to be put

348
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:52,130
on different centers to help the kundalini
to settle herself properly in these centers,

349
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,140
and to rise. And this, you have to do it.
You have to raise your own kundalini. I’ll

350
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:05,420
just tell you how it is done, is very simple,
where to put which hand. Now, in the beginning

351
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,130
you just keep your eyes open and see that
on the heart first, I’ll tell you later

352
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:15,630
on, just now see, that on the heart, then
on the upper part of the abdomen, then on

353
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,380
the lower part of the abdomen, then going
back in the upper part of the abdomen, then

354
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,980
on your heart again. I will tell you one by
one, everything.

355
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:29,310
And then here, this is the center which catches
very much when you feel guilty. And it’s

356
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:34,720
still very bad today. So just here, at the
back. From the front you have to take the

357
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,160
hand and put it on the left-hand side like
this, between the angle of the neck and the

358
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,070
shoulder, and just press it a little bit behind
like that. This is very important center.

359
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,370
And this is how I find people get spondylitis
and angina, all kinds of diseases; because

360
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,770
they feel guilty all the time. There’s nothing
to feel guilty. Then you have to put your

361
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:01,750
hand here, this is the center of Christ, and
another one, here at back. And then you have

362
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:07,700
to stretch your hand and put this center of
your hand on top of your head, here on the

363
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,700
fontanel bone area which we call as the Brahmarandra,
and press it hard. And move it clockwise like

364
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:21,900
this, seven times. So this all we will be
doing after closing our eyes, which is a simple

365
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,830
thing; only people make mistakes when they
do not put their hands this way but this way,

366
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,620
and it pains, so best is to do it in this
manner.

367
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Now, all these centers we are trying on the
left-hand side, that one should remember;

368
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,050
not on the right-hand side. Every center I’ll
describe to you, and I’m sure we’ll all

369
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,430
achieve our realization. Now, the left hand
towards Me and both the feet on the ground.

370
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,470
You shouldn’t watch others. This is the
first time you are going to see yourself,

371
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,940
so don’t watch anybody else, only you have
to watch yourself within. And please don’t

372
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:03,940
open your eyes. Keep your eyes shut till I
tell you. Now, the right hand has to go on

373
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,260
the heart.

374
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Now, here resides the spirit. You have to
now ask Me a very fundamental question. You

375
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:27,020
can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can call
Me “Mother,” whatever you like. “Mother,

376
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:34,610
am I the spirit?” Ask this fundamental question
with full confidence in yourself. “Mother,

377
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:01,120
am I the spirit?” Three times.

378
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:10,570
Now after this a very fundamental question
again follows, just after this, that if you

379
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:17,570
are the spirit, you are your own master. So
you put your hand please on the left-hand

380
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:26,860
side of your stomach, in the upper part. Here,
you again ask Me a question three times, “Mother,

381
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:41,970
am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guide?
Mother, am I my own guru?” Three times.

382
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:00,980
Now, please take this hand in the lower part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, and

383
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:26,270
press it hard a little with your fingers.
Lower part of the abdomen, lower part. Now,

384
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:37,280
this is a center of the true knowledge of
the Divine, the laws of the Divine, the technique

385
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,320
of the Divine. The pure knowledge resides
in this center. Now, I cannot force you to

386
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:59,030
ask this knowledge, so I would request you
to say that you want this knowledge. So please

387
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,920
say, “Mother, may I have the pure knowledge,
the true knowledge?” You have to say this

388
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:16,730
six times, because this center has got six
petals. Six times. “May I have the true

389
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:26,420
knowledge, may I have the pure knowledge?”
This will excite the kundalini.

390
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Now raise your right hand on the upper part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, press

391
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:18,670
hard. Here again, this being the center of
a master, a Guru Principle center which is

392
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:34,130
created by all the great masters of the world,
you have to assert, to make a seat for the

393
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:42,640
kundalini to rise. With full confidence in
yourself, you have to say, “Mother, I am

394
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:52,560
my own master. Mother, I am my own guru,”
ten times. “Mother, I am my own guide.”

395
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:03,770
Ten times, because there are ten principles
of the mastery.

396
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:16,750
Now, please raise your hand to your heart
and press it there, on the heart. Here resides

397
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:25,870
the spirit. The truth is, you are the spirit.
So now you have to assert again, twelve times.

398
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:36,740
There are the twelve petals here. Twelve times
you have to say, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

399
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Have confidence in yourself. Please say it.
“Mother, I am the spirit.” Believe in

400
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,720
yourself. Have faith in yourself. You are
the spirit.

401
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:05,780
Now please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and the shoulder, on the left-hand

402
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:31,050
side, and take it little backward and hold
it tight. Here is the center which goes into

403
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:44,370
problem when you feel guilty. So please say
sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty

404
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:56,830
at all.” Divine is the ocean of love, peace,
graciousness, but above all it is the ocean

405
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:07,830
of forgiveness. So please say it sixteen times,
with full confidence that you are not guilty

406
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:18,180
at all, “Mother, I am not guilty at all
for anything.” Forget the past. Forget the

407
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:26,280
past. Be in the present. Close your eyes in
a way that there’s no pressure on the eyes,

408
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:44,960
close them fully. Sixteen times. If you still,
if you still feel that you are guilty, you

409
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,740
better punish yourself by saying it hundred-and-eight
times. That would be better then, for some

410
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:00,740
people who just indulge into this kind of
a pastime for nothing at all. “Mother, I

411
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:09,970
am not guilty at all.”

412
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:37,300
Now, please put your right hand on your forehead
across, and press it on both the sides. Here

413
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:08,410
you have to say – how many times is not
the point. Here you have to say from your

414
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:16,650
heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone. Mother,
I forgive everyone.” From your heart. Those

415
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:25,830
who say it is difficult to say are under wrong
impression, because it’s a myth. Whether

416
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:34,030
you forgive or don’t forgive, it’s a myth.
On your forehead, please. Not on your head,

417
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:42,250
but on your forehead. On your forehead. From
your heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive

418
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:52,940
everyone.” Because if you don’t forgive
you are playing into the hands of wrong people.

419
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:59,940
It’s a myth, in any case.

420
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:07,270
Now, take this hand on the back of your head.
Just for your satisfaction you may say that

421
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:16,150
“If I have done any mistakes, oh Divine,
please forgive me.” Just for your satisfaction

422
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:23,150
you should say that, because the Divine has
already forgiven you. Now, please stretch

423
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,480
your hand and put your palm on the fontanel
bone area which is a soft bone in your childhood,

424
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:45,800
and press it hard and move it seven times.
Press it hard; the center part you press it

425
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,240
hard, the center part.

426
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:23,520
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

427
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:42,450
Now slowly take down your hand, and slowly
open your eyes. Now, without thinking, you

428
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,360
have to watch Me; just without thinking. You
can do it. Without thinking. There’s no

429
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:54,360
thought. Now you may put on your glasses if
you want to, and without thinking you put

430
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,510
your right hand like this, little higher,
and with the left hand just try to see if

431
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:12,510
there’s a cool breeze coming out – with
the left hand. It’s very subtle, it’s

432
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:20,560
sukshma; with the left hand. Put your right
hand like this, please. It’s very, very

433
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:29,750
subtle, very subtle. Little higher. Maybe
about four inches, five inches. Here. Hmm.

434
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:39,560
Now, put the right hand on top again, left
hand towards Me. There’ll be some heat coming

435
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:48,740
out, doesn’t matter. Let it come out. Is
here. There’s no thought in your mind, you

436
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:04,390
can see there’s no thought. Now raise both
the hands and push back your head, and ask

437
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,240
a question, “Is this the cool breeze of
the Holy Ghost? Is this the all-pervading

438
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Power of God? Is this the Brahma Shakti?”
Ask the question. “Is this the Power that

439
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:19,650
does all living work?” Just push back your
head and ask. Now, put down your hands. See

440
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:26,650
if you feel it in your hands. Like this, like
this. Opening out. There. And you are relaxed.

441
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,360
There’s a peace that is emitted. All right?
Keep the neck straight. Straight neck.

442
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,790
One more thing I would like to tell you – how
to raise your own kundalini. Because this

443
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:49,770
is the only program we are having here, so
I’m sorry I have to tell you all in one

444
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:54,440
program. But you all have to come to our centers.
We have them in every corner of England and

445
00:58:54,440 --> 00:59:01,440
also in London, where you can meet people
and find out more about it, and master it.

446
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:08,920
That’s what you have to do, on the follow-on.
You must come and pay attention fully to it.

447
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,930
It’s not only when I come that you should
come. They are all here who have known about

448
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:18,970
it, and they will just guide you. They are
not going to dominate you, they are just here

449
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:25,420
to guide you; and once you know, when you
become masters, then you can do the same.

450
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:32,420
Because I’m alone, and how many people can
I meet? I have to travel, I have to go in

451
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:37,120
other countries also. So, there are people
who are quite equipped, and they will tell

452
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:44,120
you all about it in a very sensible way. Just
listen to them and they will guide you, and

453
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,220
you will reach your destination very soon.
You need hardly a month to understand it,

454
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,490
hardly a month.

455
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:57,490
Now, how to get yourself into a complete protection.
You have to give protection to your aura.

456
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:06,800
So for that you have to raise your hand from
this to this, like that, seven times. Let’s

457
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,880
do it. One, two, three – this is a protection
to our aura – four, five, six and seven.

458
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:36,810
Now to raise your kundalini, put your hand
while sitting down, in front of you just like

459
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:49,210
this. In front. And the movement of the left
hand should be straight like that, watching

460
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,030
the hand, and the right hand should be upward,
forward, downward, backward. It’s very simple,

461
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,600
like that, clockwise and this hand should
move straight till you reach the head. I’ll

462
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,610
tell you how. Now, let’s start.

463
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:12,610
It’s very simple. Even a child can do it.
Push back your head, loosen your shoulders

464
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:23,290
and give it a twist. And now tie it up. Let’s
do it again. Three times. See now it’s moving

465
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:26,990
faster. Push back your head. Now. The kundalini
moves with it. Now, this is what the Christ’s

466
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,420
disciples did, and people didn’t understand.
And let’s have it once more and this time

467
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:36,420
three knots are needed on your head, so you
fix up the kundalini on top of your head.

468
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:51,020
One, two and the three. Now, you feel it in
your hands. See now the ….

469
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,720
The face changes. Eyes start glistening. A
different glint comes in, and that’s how

470
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,170
you know you are a realized soul; and that’s
how you know you are My children. But you

471
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:13,170
have to establish it. You have to establish
the experience. Even those who haven’t got

472
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:24,310
it, doesn’t matter. Everyone can get it
and you have to establish it, and for establishing

473
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:30,950
luckily today it’s very easy, because we
have here so many people who can tell you

474
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:37,100
all about it. They have understood it fully,
they know it, they know everything and they

475
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:43,300
will tell you all about it. There’s no secret
in Sahaja Yoga. Everything is going to be

476
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,730
told to you.

477
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,960
May God bless you.

478
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,620
How many of you have felt the cool breeze
on the head and as well as in the hands? If

479
01:02:54,620 --> 01:03:01,620
you have felt on the hands or in the head,
please raise both your hands. Both your hands.

480
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:09,600
All of you felt it! Except for very few, all
of you have felt. Those of you who haven’t

481
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
felt it shouldn’t mind, it will all work
out. There are people who can help you out.

482
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:29,480
Thank you very much. May God give you wisdom
and strength to establish yourself as great

483
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,900
yogis.
