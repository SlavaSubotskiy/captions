1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:09,780
There are in these modern times, many seekers
of truth. It's a special category of people

2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:23,870
born in these modern times. Perhaps we are
not aware that in every country, a lot of

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,480
people are born with this seeking. They are
a special category which, sees beyond, tries

4
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:46,519
to find something beyond, what they can perceive
through their sense organs. The truth as we

5
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,710
see, is through our sense organs. For example
something we see as white, we call it white,

6
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,399
something we feel cool, we call it cold, something
as hot, means whatever we perceive through

7
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:14,630
our sense organs and whatever is communicated
to us through our central nervous system we

8
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:22,899
accept as truth, and we should accept that
only, as truth. And not something that is

9
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:32,399
told to us, not something that we have read
in the books, not something that we can project

10
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,920
our mind to, and then .......................that
does not mean that I deny any one of the scriptures.

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,719
That does not mean that I deny anything that
we have known so far. But to begin with let

12
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,719
us start from scratch as they call it or a
clean slate. Let us see what is the truth.

13
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,060
Now in every religion truth has been described.
As I can see it, everybody does not see it

14
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,489
themselves.....................That's why
there's blindness, that's why there are these

15
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:21,489
blind alleys where you end up, arguing things.
So there must be something that is missing

16
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,780
within us, that we have not been able to really
relate truth to our central nervous system.

17
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:42,470
And what is that missing within us, we should
find out. In all humility we should know that

18
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,269
there must be something within us, that we
have been arguing about so many things, we

19
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:57,269
have been talking about so many things, reading
so many books, going into all kinds of funny

20
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,470
experiences, right from alcohol to other drugs
and Gurus and this and that, but still we

21
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,489
have not felt anything on our central nervous
system.

22
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:19,489
Secondly that we have no control over that
truth. So, so what is the reason? Is it there

23
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,260
is something missing in the human awareness?
Is it that we are lacking something in our

24
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:36,409
human awareness? All the books, all the scriptures,
which are true scriptures have said one thing,

25
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,030
that to know the truth, you are to be born
again. That's not only in the bible. You see

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,269
if you take Patanjali which is a very ancient
book, it's not that the Patanjali asked you

27
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,150
to stand on your heads, is wrong, it's just
a wee, wee, wee, wee bit of it. But what Patanjali

28
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:04,150
has written is that you have to achieve the
truth on your central nervous system through

29
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,650
your ATMASAKSHAT, the word is written, meaning
the experience of your SPIRIT.

30
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,650
Now English language has an advantage and
a disadvantage, that the spirit could be alcohol,

31
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,320
the spirit could be an alcohol! Or spirit
could be a dead body, it could be any circumstance,

32
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,090
but it is not so. There are three separate
things, absolutely opposite to each other.

33
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:44,090
So the ATMA the SPIRIT has to be found out,
is said even by Mohammed Sahib, he said you

34
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,690
are to become the PIR, is said by. Zoroaster,
is said by Loa Tse, is also said by Zen. Buddha

35
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,100
has said it, Mahavira has said it, everyone
of them has said it, so many religions have

36
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,030
started in the name of God without going to
the truth, that you have to be born again.

37
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,490
Now you have to be born again does mean that
you certify yourself 'I am born again'. Self

38
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,930
certificate, you can call it 'I am born again',
but you don't become. What is so special if

39
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,930
you are born again, what should be so? The
human awareness at this level is just ready

40
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,280
to be born again. Now in Sanskrit the word
for a bird is DWIJAHA, means born again, and

41
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,020
also for a Brahmin who is born again. But
those who call themselves Brahmins are not

42
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,750
Brahmins. They just call themselves Brahmins,
have they come to know the Brahma, the all

43
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,750
pervading power of God. Those who say they
are born again, should feel the all pervading

44
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,300
power of God around them, if they cannot feel
it they are not born again. So all these self

45
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,780
certificates are deception, self deception
and deception of others, is just a money making

46
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,819
process.
So the truth has to be achieved through your

47
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:33,819
evolutionary process which is a living process.
Again we must understand a LIVING process.

48
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,509
Not you just talking, mental projections,
just sitting down here big talk about it,

49
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:46,509
or by giving you some courses, or taking some
money from you. You cannot get it, it's a

50
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:53,669
STATE in a living growth, that proves that
it is a living thing. Means the state of our

51
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,360
awareness has to be higher than what it is.
If our state cannot rise then it is not of

52
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:16,410
any use. Like the seed becomes the roots then
the bark, the leaves, the flowers then the

53
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,300
fruit. Different states. In the same way a
living religion must give you a different

54
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,300
state and that nucleus of religion is within
ourselves. Everyone of us has it. When we

55
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:45,770
go against that living religion within us
we go into imbalances. But even today people

56
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:52,500
can ask why the religion, why should we have
a balance, what is the need, lets go into

57
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,500
imbalances, I mean, is that a logical question.
People can ask why the religion, why has the

58
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:07,210
religion in the stomach..........................so
what is the religion we come to that point,

59
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,800
is that, a religion is a valency of human
beings.

60
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Just like carbon has four valences human beings
have ten valences, which matter does not have.

61
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:23,449
Animals have nine and human beings have ten
valences. And when these ten valences go out

62
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:30,449
of balance then, they go out of the quality
of a human being. But still one can ask why

63
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,860
do we have those ten valences. Because we
have to ascend, because in the evolutionary

64
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,040
process you have to ascend and you can never
be satisfied with yourself unless and until

65
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,040
you have achieved it. Especially the seekers,
that's why I say they are the special category

66
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,200
because in this special category men of God
will have to become prophets and they will

67
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:13,210
have powers to make others prophets, said
by William Blake. In your great country William

68
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,020
Blake has said it.
When is that going to happen? It has to happen

69
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,020
today, tonight. But there are barriers within
us, built in, not because of anything else

70
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:40,140
but only because we have misled ourselves.
We have been going to various roads of seeking,

71
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,660
whatever suited us, where ever we went to,
we have tried to...............and we have

72
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,360
insured ourselves within ourselves sometimes,
we have built up certain barriers. Now when

73
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:19,470
you become the prophet, actually become your
own master, become a free person, you have

74
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,700
to be a free person. So far you are not. You
cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your

75
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:44,130
own temptations, infatuations, emotional problems,
mental worries -- why? Because you are still

76
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:58,310
standing in the waves of this turmoil. This
troubled area where you just see the waves

77
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,560
all the time and you are frightened of breaking
down, but if you somehow or other get out

78
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,560
of it and get into the boat of your own being,
then you enjoy, you become a witness a Sakshi.

79
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:32,170
Even to understand the scriptures, you have
to become a free person, which you are not.

80
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,710
You have to be your own master, for that you
cannot pay. I am too free, that I cannot accept

81
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:48,450
it. To get your freedom of Spirit you can't
pay, because money is money. Money has no

82
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,180
value in the Divine field. Nothing can bring
forth this but your own ascent. And how do

83
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:11,770
we ascend? Is there anything built within
us? So what ever I am telling you today is

84
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:22,170
the knowledge of the roots. What we see is
the knowledge of the tree. We see it from

85
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
outside, we see a leaf from out side, if we
have to treat the leaf, we have to go to the

86
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,100
roots. But from outside, when we see the tree
we are still outside also. When you have to

87
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:50,110
treat the leaf, you have to go to the roots,
if you block out the leaf, it is dead. Then

88
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,140
you put it under the microscope, you can go
on seeing cells after that you can see the

89
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:03,140
nucleus, you can go on analysing it, and analysing
it making it dead, and dead and dead. But

90
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,320
to treat it you have to go to the roots. And
this knowledge of roots we have here.

91
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:19,070
There's nothing wrong in knowing something
new. These are not new ideas, these are ancient

92
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:29,060
ideas, very ancient ideas. In the Bible it
is described as the Holy Ghost. One priest

93
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,460
was asked I saw ......................a very
narrow minded priest, what do you know about

94
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Holy Ghost? He said "I am agnostic". So then
they said, what are you doing here? He said

95
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,920
"I am doing my job". If that is the attitude
towards God, towards your inner knowledge,

96
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,390
then you can never reach there as you cannot
reach the tree through the leaf, you have

97
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:05,390
to go to the roots. This has been available
only to seers, like you can say William Blake.

98
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like we had many in other countries, but they
did not talk about it because perhaps that

99
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,750
was not the time for people to know. But in
many languages it is described.

100
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Now the roots within us, if you can see this,
are placed in this manner. When I went to

101
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,850
America the Indian society invited me to talk
to them about the unconscious. I had never

102
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,970
read Jung, though I knew he was a realised
soul at least he got his realization at the

103
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,980
later time. So I said all right let me have
a look, let me see .............theory, say,

104
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,980
and as I opened the book I saw a diagram,
what he had drawn of a human being and I said

105
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:20,930
that's the mistake. Because he saw human beings
from outside and he described them in layers,

106
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:29,930
like first he said is the unconscious that
cannot be expressed, manifested then the unconscious

107
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:36,410
that can be manifested, then he said about
at least the sub-conscious and then he said

108
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:43,410
above that is the conscious mind, then above
that is the ego. Like layers, one after another.

109
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Now when you are sitting here, though you
are in layers the path is laid down. In the

110
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,470
same way within us, God being the greatest
organiser, he has not made us into layers

111
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,680
but what he has made us in a parallel way,
as you can see there very clearly. Left side

112
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:26,370
and right side. Left side and right side,
the central path, three paths he has made

113
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,760
within us, for our evolutionary process. The
central path works out our evolution. The

114
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:48,210
left side gives us the desire and the right
side gives us the power of action. These are

115
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:58,880
just the principles I am telling you but you
can understand it slowly when you grow, all

116
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,110
the details of it.
The central path is evolution, has brought

117
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:11,110
you today to this level of human awareness.
Now beyond that is a very short ascent which

118
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:25,020
you have to achieve; by which you become the
Spirit. But there has to be some living process

119
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,839
for this to happen. And what is that living
process built within us, is the reflection

120
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,780
of the Holy Ghost within us in the triangular
bone, which is called as Kundalini in Sanskrit

121
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,780
language. This exists within us, and you can
see with your naked eyes, sometimes, in some

122
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:02,030
people where there is an obstruction in the
higher centres, it starts pulsating. And when

123
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:10,510
we can sense, we can also see it clearly in
some people when it is obstructing. Or through

124
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:20,060
your stethoscope you can feel the percussion
which we call as anahat at the top of the

125
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:28,910
head here, where it pulsates and then it breaks.
When this breaks the pulsation stops and you

126
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:40,720
start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area.

127
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,720
This is a happening and not ..............................in
the sense that the happening takes place so

128
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,220
that you get connected with the truth.
So the connection takes place and you start

129
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,220
feeling on your finger tips the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost which surrounds you. Actually,

130
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,280
you start feeling. But then as the rational
mind says so what! Though we feel the cool

131
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:22,490
breeze, so what? Then one should know, that
when we have eyes we start seeing, when we

132
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:30,220
have ears we start hearing, so now you have
got a new awareness, what is this awareness?

133
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:37,610
This is the awareness of collective consciousness,
that you become, again I say you become, you

134
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:44,370
are not just certified but you become, it's
a question of becoming, that you become collectively

135
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:51,370
conscious. That on your central nervous system
you can feel another person, you can feel

136
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:58,310
yourself, you can feel your centres which
are shown here, you can feel the centres of

137
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:03,360
others on your fingertips. And the best one
is, is Mohammed Sahib, I would say because

138
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,360
he made it clear, at the time of resurrection
your hands will speak. But who talks about

139
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:18,700
the resurrection? Nowhere! People talk about
it, they talk about the doomsday, because

140
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,230
they can frighten people of the doomsday first,
and take advantage of it and make money out

141
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:30,230
of it.
God who has made this universe, he feels love,

142
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:37,820
do you think he will destroy this great creation
of his without giving us the fruit, without

143
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:45,670
letting us know the fruit of his creation.
He is the wisest of wise. The greatest compassionate

144
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:00,370
source of love, how could he allow this universe
to be destroyed, especially this Earth, which

145
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:11,270
is a special present from him. So don't believe
in all these stupid ideas of destruction and

146
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:22,170
the last complete devastation. Still lot of
plans, you are suppose to enjoy the blessings

147
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:37,090
of the Divine for which he has created you.
So the experience of truth has to be felt

148
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,320
on the central nervous system. The problem
is, not that you belong, you may feel, but

149
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:59,230
as you know the experience is very slow in
the western countries. I am sorry, not that

150
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,970
you are in any way less seekers, you are very
great seekers, I would say you are greater

151
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,550
seekers than the Indians are, much greater
seekers. Indians have still a lot of steps

152
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,880
to come up to your level, no doubt, but while
coming up to this level, you have developed

153
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,880
a lot of problems around and that's why the
seeking is sometimes, takes time to express

154
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,760
itself as a fruitful gain of Self Realization.
So you'll get your self realization no doubt

155
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,780
but again the Kundalini goes down. I must
tell you very frankly, because I cannot be

156
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,780
dishonest, but it can be brought up, by you,
by understanding how to work it out. By co-operating

157
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,640
with your self, by understanding your self,
that you are the temple of God and that you

158
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,380
have to work it out with respect to yourself,
and you have to give some time. I mean in

159
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,640
Caxton Hall, you must have seen there, thousands
of people have got it. I have been working

160
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,640
in this England for twelve years now, twelve
years, is the last year now. Special reason

161
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,320
for that, but what I find, people get their
realization and then they're lost. Then when

162
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,650
they have some disease or something, they'll
telephone to me Mother, now I am.............

163
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:45,650
has happened or I am suffering from cancer...........................is
too far gone a case, but if you know how to

164
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,820
handle your roots, how to nourish it, how
to look after it, then you flower out, you

165
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:10,330
bear fruits, and by your fruits people know
what it is. Then you become trees, giant trees,

166
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
like moving trees. And when people come under
such trees, get realization.

167
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,210
English are a great people no doubt, they
are placed in a country which is the heart

168
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,210
of the universe, you are very important. I
have given the maximum time to England, you'll

169
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:42,170
be amazed, maximum time. But the Sahaja Yogis
who are not in the country have grown much

170
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:54,360
faster than in England. The reason is, it's
like the foundation that always gets (damp

171
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:04,470
in it) you are the ..................................................foundation.
Remove the darkness, again it gets dark. Rather

172
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:19,250
difficult! But once they are settled, you
will be circulating the Divine interpretation,

173
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,470
the Divine experience of truth all over the
world. You are like the hard-core and this

174
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:38,470
is what you have to do. We cannot be mediocre
in Sahaja Yoga. There is no compromise with

175
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:50,500
your self, you become so powerful that you
don't compromise also, you can just get out

176
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:57,500
of everything in no time. But you must accept
yourself first of all, have faith in yourself.

177
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,580
Once upon a time the English had too much
faith in themselves, I mean extraordinarily

178
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,400
powerful people, now they are the other way
around, they have no faith. You see now this

179
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,740
darkness has come and ....the darkness has
come ...................thrown out.

180
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:19,740
This is the second phase that I find is complete
lethargy. Oh what can happen, let us be destroyed

181
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:29,890
Mother, now that's the best part, completely
reconciled to our doom. Now how to get them

182
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,190
to be creative? We have to circulate. They
are the cells, who are like in the heart,

183
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,400
who have to pump the heart...............................
So I have to make a humble request, that I

184
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:01,050
know experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow but
very steady and I am sure that today I have

185
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:11,550
got people who are a rare quality of courage.
And as individual which was the English character,

186
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:20,490
once upon a time, and that they will take
it up seriously, their ascent and the ascent

187
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,380
of the whole world.
We'll be having about three more lectures

188
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:32,179
and there I will tell you more elaborately
about Kundalini and the Chakras, about all

189
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:39,179
this knowledge. All this knowledge is available
to you. Now, because this time was for you

190
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:47,210
to know all these secrets. Some newspaper
people asked me, Mother have you got your

191
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,220
disciples all very big scholars, I said no,
they are very ordinary people. Some may be,

192
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:02,220
they are more difficult, but mostly they are
very normal, ordinary people. Simple people.

193
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,740
But what makes you think that? They said they
are so scholarly they know so much, because

194
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,740
you become the knowledge.
So truth is the knowledge, the rest of it

195
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,620
is all mythical. Is mythical, what do we know
about things is all mythical, because what

196
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,380
ever we see from outside, is outside. Like
I would say we appreciate Mona Lisa, we appreciate

197
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:51,110
the miracles as we say, the great miracles
that human beings have created. Why? Why do

198
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,420
we call them miracles? Sometimes we think
that we have observed a very miraculous task,

199
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:06,420
they are, mentally we think. But actually
it is not so. Because they have vibrations,

200
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:16,480
they have Divine vibrations, they emit vibrations
and they appeal to you because in your heart

201
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,480
lies that Spirit, which is the universal being
and which gives that feeling of bewilderment

202
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,720
when you see these great miracles human beings
have created. At least I have seen six of

203
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:42,270
them, and all of them have tremendous vibrations.
But unless and until you become a realised

204
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:49,270
soul, how will you know? (silence)
Now this is the only .............. and to

205
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:59,330
become the realised soul you have to have
the ascent of the Kundalini and proper state

206
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:08,580
of that Kundalini to remain there and that's
the point where I found we lack in the efforts.

207
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Lack in courage, in patience, so again and
again I request you that don't be superficial.

208
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:32,470
The Americans were superficial, you better
not be. You be solid people, serious, take

209
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,970
it up seriously. Because you are going to
be the Europeans, the Americans even the Greeks,

210
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,690
even the Italians, the problem is the horse
is behind the cart.........................but

211
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:55,690
what do I do, prove to the horse, that you
get up now because of you the cart is not

212
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:05,540
moving. That's why ...........very very special
..........to see you all, that you must decide

213
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,929
that if we get our Realization, we'll establish
ourselves into Sahaja Yoga. For which you

214
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:19,929
don't have to pay, there's no membership,
there's no organisation, nothing. I have nothing

215
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:27,299
to take from you. You can't give me.
So I hope today, many who are new will get

216
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,799
their Realization and establish themselves
and will not forget it. Because in the beginning

217
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,799
the experience is very great, you feel like
you are coming out of a pub. I don't know

218
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:00,860
what that experience is, must be that way
(laughter) because I've seen so many people

219
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
coming and falling down and again going in,
must be some memory of something great, must

220
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,480
be that. So by God's grace you should all
get your Realization and I would like to have

221
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:31,130
some questions, but in that I would like to
say that there are people I know, we have

222
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,610
had before also, belonging to some gurus or
something big, like some gurus have come too,

223
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,380
because you see they feel, the gurus are feeling
that I may been attacking them; in a way,

224
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:49,380
they feel that way because I say you cannot
pay, so their profession is finished. So they

225
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,530
get angry with me for that, so they might
be saying they are in .................and

226
00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:01,860
attack her and all sorts of things and there
could be some people who are impressive because

227
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:08,860
of other problems of ego or something. So
you need not be offensive, I have come here

228
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,160
to give you what you have and you need not
be also docile about it or slavish. I have

229
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:26,549
come here to give you or tell you what is
free.

230
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,679
Now you may also say, it is a very common
question that arises in your mind, and justified,

231
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,679
that why should I do it, now that's the miserable
part of it, that I have to do it, I wish you

232
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:47,380
could do it, but you can't that's the problem.
And if I have to do it, I don't hurt your

233
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:54,500
ego. No! I don't want to hurt it. You see
this is something people don't understand,

234
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:04,740
that why should I do it. You can do it also,
but first I have to take you little bit............your

235
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:14,970
awareness has to grow a little more, then
you can do it your way, but first definitely,

236
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,500
I have to do that. Which is a .........it
makes me also a miserable person because............you

237
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,500
know...........a thankless job, but I have
to do it. Maybe I am doing it for it somehow,

238
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:37,550
I don't know...........but it should be............It's
a crucifixion, I tell you, it's not easy,

239
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:46,909
it's a very difficult task. It's like mountains
sometimes, the Kundalini is just embedded,

240
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,720
poor thing sometimes so hurt, so wounded that
to raise that Kundalini itself takes such

241
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,920
a load, effort. But one has to do it and I
know 

242
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:41,910
I have to do it. When you will know 

243
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:39,609
what 

244
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,220
it is, you will not 

245
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:31,510
be angry with me, but 

246
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:37,020
you 

247
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:58,970
will understand the task and .............all
of us, all 

248
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,660
of 

249
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,560
us 

250
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:31,510
have to 

251
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:23,250
do it.
May God Bless You.
