1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:09,928
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:24,100
You have to know that truth is what it is.

3
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,539
We cannot conceptualize it with our human
awareness.

4
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:38,292
We cannot order it, we cannot manipulate it,
we cannot organize it.

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:42,974
It is what it is, has been and will be.

6
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:45,872
And what is the truth?

7
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:59,471
Truth is that we are surrounded or we are
penetrated or we are nourished, looked after

8
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:13,572
and loved by a very subtle energy which is
the energy of divine love.

9
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:26,942
The second truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

10
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:33,322
but we are the spirit.

11
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:41,952
You don’t have to accept what I’m saying
blindly, because blind faith leads to fanaticism.

12
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:51,611
But as scientists you must keep your minds
open and see for yourself what I’m saying:

13
00:01:51,611 --> 00:02:03,712
if it is so, honestly you must accept it.

14
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:19,120
We know so much through science about our
civilization, our advancement.

15
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,492
This is the advancement of a tree which has
grown outside very much; but if we do not

16
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:35,592
know our roots, we’ll be destroyed.

17
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:41,042
So it is important to know about our roots.

18
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:47,872
And this is what it is that I would say are
our roots.

19
00:02:47,872 --> 00:03:11,482
As you can see, there are seven centers within
us, and these subtle centers are placed in

20
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:18,651
the spinal cord and the brain.

21
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:25,151
These cater to our physical, mental, emotional
and spiritual needs.

22
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:35,882
On the physical side they manifest the energy
for the use of our plexuses which look after

23
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,241
our physical problems.

24
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:51,901
That is on the right side, the energy which
is supplied by this yellow line, a subtle

25
00:03:51,901 --> 00:04:02,312
channel – we call it as the Pingala Nadi
– this supplies energy for our physical

26
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:06,042
and mental actions.

27
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:15,372
So this is the power of action within us which
also caters to the right sympathetic nervous

28
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:18,312
system.

29
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:27,422
The another channel you see on the left-hand
side is the channel by which we desire, put

30
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:30,042
our energy to our desire.

31
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:37,132
So this is the power of desire and looks after
our emotions.

32
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:44,012
This is the one which looks after our conditionings
also.

33
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:54,222
At the end of these two channels they create
two institutions: one on the right side crosses

34
00:04:54,222 --> 00:05:01,842
over, and the yellow balloon that you see
is the ego, is the balloon of ego that we

35
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:11,002
have; and the left-hand side one that, which
conditions our mind is the balloon of superego.

36
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:19,972
As we start growing, in age by the time we
are twelve years of age, these two completely

37
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:31,412
meet and the soft bone in our head becomes
completely calcified.

38
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:45,472
Now there’s third energy within us which
is in the center, and this central energy

39
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:49,991
is the one which has made us human beings.

40
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:57,182
And these centers are the milestones of our
evolution.

41
00:05:57,182 --> 00:06:04,742
So now the last jumping is left out.

42
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:09,882
It has reached up to the limbic area.

43
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:29,712
Now, only thing, it has to break through the
soft bone in the, on the head and break through

44
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:36,122
that, which is the actualization of baptism.

45
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:44,372
Baptism is not an artificial thing – it
is an actualization.

46
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:58,222
But the energy that does it is, we call it
sleeping energy, in the triangular bone called

47
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,782
as sacrum.

48
00:06:59,782 --> 00:07:08,522
That means the Greeks knew that this is a
sacred bone, that they called it “sacrum.”

49
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:18,512
This energy has to rise and break through
that fontanel bone area and connect us to

50
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:28,772
that subtle divine Power which we have never
felt during human awareness.

51
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:42,122
Thus we get connected to this divine Power,
and we start feeling it on our fingertips.

52
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:50,642
It’s described in the Koran that “at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak,

53
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:54,442
and they will give witness against you.”

54
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:59,632
That is, you start feeling your own centers
– these are five, six and seven centers

55
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:08,782
– and they indicate what’s wrong with
you within yourself, what’s the problem.

56
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:19,101
Also you can feel the cool breeze coming out
of your head, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

57
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:29,692
Because this sleeping power which is called
as the kundalini – “kundala” means “coils”

58
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:36,142
– is the power of pure desire within us.

59
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:45,392
[Disturbance by a man in the audience]

60
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:49,362
What’s he talking?

61
00:08:49,362 --> 00:09:00,752
Ah …. This is the result, you know, of tensions,
on modern tensions.

62
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:04,351
So many such things are happening.

63
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,372
People have no peace.

64
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:16,372
That’s what I say, the tree has outgrown
itself: it must find its roots.

65
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:23,582
In America they say there are fifty-five per
cent people who suffer from terrible nervousness,

66
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:29,122
and at least thirty per cent people have got
schizophrenia.

67
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:35,733
It’s a very dangerous thing.

68
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:43,471
If we don’t understand how delicately we
are made and to realize that we are human

69
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:52,151
beings, the epitome of evolution, we are going
to land in great difficulties.

70
00:09:52,151 --> 00:10:00,432
We may try to run away from reality, but reality
will have an effect on us.

71
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:10,022
Now, so now we have this kind of a mechanism
within us existing.

72
00:10:10,022 --> 00:10:18,541
Now this is a living process of evolution,
and you must understand that we don’t pay

73
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:27,692
for living process, and we can’t even explain
it; because when you take a small little seed

74
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:34,221
and put it in the Mother Earth, it germinates
by itself spontaneously.

75
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:39,582
You don’t pay to the Mother Earth anything.

76
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:48,211
And when it germinates, it grows into a tree
and produces thousands of seeds.

77
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:56,822
So in that little seed the map of all the
things it was going to create is there.

78
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,791
How it works, we never ask this question.

79
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,262
We take all the things for granted.

80
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:10,932
We don’t even ask the question how this
wonderful eye of ours is made like a camera,

81
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:16,852
and that how we are programmed within ourselves
like computers.

82
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:23,152
You see this is the color; you don’t have
to think about – it’s there.

83
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:36,091
Through our sensory organs, how we find out
things: we’d never question it.

84
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:45,602
But to answer now all our questions, we have
to become the divine computer.

85
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:51,442
And that’s why we have to be connected to
the mains, I call them, as the people who

86
00:11:51,442 --> 00:12:03,872
are self-realized, the people who have got
their spirit in their attention.

87
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:13,732
When the attention is enlightened through
this happening, then you can see the absolute

88
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,982
truth.

89
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:22,382
Like supposing you are holding on to a snake
and there’s darkness, and somebody tells,

90
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:29,152
there is darkness, “But you have got a snake
in your hand.

91
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:30,541
I can see it.”

92
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,771
He’ll say, “No, I think it is a rope.”

93
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:42,302
Now if you put on the light, immediately that
person will drop.

94
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:49,901
In the same way, when the attention gets enlightened
by the spirit, the first nature, innate nature

95
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:56,901
of the spirit is that it manifests absolute
truth.

96
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:03,372
You immediately become so empowered that you
give up all those habits which are destructive

97
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,732
to your life – immediately.

98
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:13,232
I have seen people giving up drugs overnight
in London, alcoholism, all kinds of things.

99
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:19,002
I was amazed the way it’s working.

100
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:27,432
It’s your own power within you; it just
there, is existing.

101
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:35,632
There’s no obligation of any kind, it’s
just one enlightened candle can enlighten

102
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,052
another candle.

103
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,992
That’s how it works.

104
00:13:39,992 --> 00:13:46,762
And it has to work – otherwise, as I told
you, we are standing on the brink of destruction.

105
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:55,382
Leave alone things like drugs and things we
take to escape reality, there are so many

106
00:13:55,382 --> 00:14:06,172
diseases that have come up and coming up that
it is going to be very difficult for us to

107
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:16,802
exist on this Mother Earth after some time:
ecological problems, the uncertainty of life,

108
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:22,012
the insecurities that are built within us.

109
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:26,432
So many conditionings we have.

110
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,752
How to get rid of them?

111
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:33,041
How to be cleansed is a very big problem today.

112
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:41,072
And for that I think it is important that
we have to get our Self-realization.

113
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:51,291
We talk, “my, my body, my hand, my mind,
my ego” – but which is this “my”?

114
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,062
Which is the “I” behind it?

115
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:59,182
And when doctors also talk about the autonomous
nervous system, they don’t say what is this

116
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,662
auto, who is this auto.

117
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:05,412
We say “automobile” – so there is a
driver sitting driving the car.

118
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:08,782
But who is driving this car?

119
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,822
That is what we have to find out.

120
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:16,782
And that auto is the spirit within us.

121
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:27,012
Unless and until the connection with the Divine
is established, all other efforts are really

122
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,042
fruitless.

123
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:33,142
And that’s why many people ask Me why all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

124
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:40,762
why people who believe in God are fighting
among themselves; why they are so sinful,

125
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,142
why aren’t they so good.

126
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:48,012
The reason is, they have not found the truth
as yet.

127
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:54,242
Just believing in any God or being born in
any religion doesn’t make you a righteous

128
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:59,752
person at all: anybody following any religion
can commit any sin.

129
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,441
There’s no bondage.

130
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:07,232
But when this kundalini rises into that green
part, as you see – we call it as a Void:

131
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,272
is the area which is like a bridging.

132
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:18,332
Very significant it is, like Moses bridged;
in the same way, this is the bridging.

133
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:23,842
And this bridging, when it takes place you
can cross over this ocean of illusion, as

134
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:25,252
we say.

135
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:32,662
But actually this ocean of illusion is representing
our ten valencies within us.

136
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:43,912
We have ten valencies, ten dharmas, ten – our
innate nature as human beings.

137
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:49,652
So when kundalini rises into this area, it
enlightens this area, and a person who is

138
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,652
a realized soul doesn’t do anything wrong.

139
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:57,921
He doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t bribes, he’s
not frightened.

140
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:06,892
He’s so courageous, he’s so compassionate,
he’s so dynamic, he’s so loving.

141
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:13,272
This is only possible when you are innately
religious.

142
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:18,772
Unless and until that happens, the religion
outside, the man-made religion, cannot give

143
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,612
you what it is promising you.

144
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:25,821
And that’s why people are surprised that
there is a big difference between the practice

145
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,362
and precepts of religion.

146
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:34,752
Every religion has said that “you seek your
Self.”

147
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:40,342
So there was nothing wrong with all the prophets,
incarnations, all the saints.

148
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,232
They all said the same thing.

149
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:48,122
But we have missed the point.

150
00:17:48,122 --> 00:17:57,762
Everything has become either money-oriented
or is an intellectual, intellectual probing.

151
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:03,292
It is through intellectual probing you reach
a point where you realize that you have not

152
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,582
reached the reality.

153
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:10,852
So what should we do?

154
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:16,072
And this is a very great gift of modern times
which was promised long time back.

155
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:25,051
Is described already in our Puranas that at
the time, these modern times called as Kali

156
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:33,071
Yuga, the Paramachaitanya or this all-pervading
Power will become active – means there is

157
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:42,472
Krita Yuga, it will become active – and
through it thousands of people will get their

158
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:44,652
realization.

159
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:48,742
Even in the Bible they have said that it’s
quite a limited number.

160
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:56,252
John the – John has written in his “Revelation”
it’s quite a limited number, but we have

161
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:59,931
already crossed that.

162
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,392
And so many people have to become realized
souls.

163
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:10,362
It’s very important today, and it’s so
easy – Sahaja.

164
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,992
“Saha” is “with”, “ja” is “born.”

165
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:20,382
Born with you is the right to become one with
the Divine, united with the Divine – that

166
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:21,972
is yoga.

167
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:26,992
“Yoga” is nothing but to be united with
that divine Power.

168
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:35,362
That’s what yoga is; all other things are
subsidiary.

169
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:45,762
This union brings forth new dimensions on
our central nervous system.

170
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:51,162
As a evolution, we always develop a new dimension.

171
00:19:51,162 --> 00:20:02,532
By this you develop a new awareness of collective
consciousness, by which you can feel other

172
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:05,571
people, their centers.

173
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:11,262
Sitting down here you can feel the center
of somebody – somebody who is dead, even

174
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:16,112
you can feel his centers and find out what
he was: was he a realized soul or not?

175
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:21,252
You can find out about anybody whether he
was a realized soul or not, sitting down here.

176
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,212
You have to just think about him, put your
hands.

177
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:30,071
If you are a realized soul you can feel on
your fingertips what is the problem.

178
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:36,222
And somehow if you know how to correct those
problems, you get rid of your own diseases

179
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:44,262
and the diseases of others, your own problems
and the problems of others.

180
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:52,012
First you enter into a state of mind which
we call as “thoughtless awareness.”

181
00:20:52,012 --> 00:21:00,032
When you cross this center of Agnya that is
placed in the optic chiasma, you become thoughtlessly

182
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:01,032
aware.

183
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:04,232
You are aware, but there is no thought.

184
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,972
What a blessing it is!

185
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:14,571
Say, I see a carpet here, it’s beautiful,
and when I look at it if I start thinking

186
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,571
“what a good carpet!”

187
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:19,672
If it is Mine it’s a very big headache because
I’ll be thinking, “I hope it goes home,

188
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:26,992
is already insured, is not lost, is not spoilt”
– all kinds of worries about this carpet.

189
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:32,571
Thank God it’s not Mine, so I’ll look
at it, still I start thinking how much I should

190
00:21:32,571 --> 00:21:37,571
pay to get it, from where can I get it; all
these thoughts coming.

191
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:46,982
But if I look at it without any thoughts,
then the joy of its creation, to whomsoever

192
00:21:46,982 --> 00:22:00,212
it may belong, so-called, starts pouring on
Me like beautiful flow of joy.

193
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:11,722
Whatever the artist has put into it, all his
joy starts pouring, that peace and that joyous

194
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:16,632
feeling within Me when I don’t think about
it.

195
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:22,002
Thinking makes a person mad, creates lots
of problems.

196
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:24,821
Too much thinking is wasteful, also.

197
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:32,571
As I’ll tell you about the second center
we have here, tomorrow, about the second center,

198
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:36,952
that by thinking, how many diseases you get.

199
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:48,291
The other day I was in a radio station and
the gentleman was asking Me, “How can I

200
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,691
get rid of my diabetes?

201
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:51,612
You say that by thinking it happens.”

202
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:55,071
I said, “Yes.”

203
00:22:55,071 --> 00:23:02,472
Because in India if they have to take tea
in a village, the sugar is put so much that

204
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:06,952
the spoon must stand at right angle!

205
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,571
And nobody gets diabetes.

206
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:19,962
But people who are sedentary, planning too
much – I mean mostly, say, bureaucrats,

207
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:26,311
diplomats, politicians – they are very vulnerable.

208
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:30,952
What is the reason for that, which I’ll
explain to you tomorrow, how we get all these

209
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:39,922
diseases because we think too much and we
cannot stop thinking.

210
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:48,102
But so far, we have to understand that we
are all on the, either on the right side or

211
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:51,052
on the left side.

212
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:54,942
We are not in the center.

213
00:23:54,942 --> 00:24:01,852
The centers are like this, I would say: the
left and the right, and the left side and

214
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:05,352
the right side join together to make the center.

215
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:09,791
Now supposing you are right-sided – means
you are using too much of your physical or

216
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:18,712
mental aptitudes, you are planning for future,
you are very futuristic – then this starts

217
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:25,541
extracting energy from this center and starts
moving to the left, right, starts moving to

218
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,702
the right.

219
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:37,282
At the same time if something happens on the
left side and you get a jerk, it is broken.

220
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:43,402
Then you are vulnerable to diseases which
we call as psychosomatic, because this is

221
00:24:43,402 --> 00:24:47,882
the one is the somatic and this is the psycho.

222
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:55,411
And these diseases cannot be cured.

223
00:24:55,411 --> 00:25:02,181
Because if somebody’s a doctor then he doesn’t
know about psychology; somebody is psychologist,

224
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,502
he doesn’t know the medicine.

225
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,332
I mean, we have doctors for one eye and another
doctor for another eye!

226
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:10,642
We have gone to that limit of specialization.

227
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:18,571
This is the science of integration.

228
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:25,602
Is not a science of specialization but integration,
because this is one body which has got the

229
00:25:25,602 --> 00:25:30,412
nose, eyes, ears all stuck to one body.

230
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:36,832
And this is one personality, and we have to
deal with this personality as a whole.

231
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:42,012
But if you start treating it like one for
the nose, one for the ears, it’s not going

232
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,311
to work out.

233
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:51,892
So when this kundalini rises through these
centers it brings them back to normal, to

234
00:25:51,892 --> 00:26:01,612
the balance, integrates them one with another
and connects them with the mains from where

235
00:26:01,612 --> 00:26:05,772
the energy flows inside.

236
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:12,762
And that’s how you become very dynamic,
you don’t get tired, you feel very young,

237
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:24,541
you never feel your age; and you are extremely
compassionate and kind, and you love to do

238
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,041
good to others.

239
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:32,772
It is so much I have to tell you.

240
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:38,082
Now Sahaja Yoga is working in forty nations,
and working out very well.

241
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:41,052
The most surprising place was USSR.

242
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:45,622
And now the people are saying, “Mother,
You have been working for twenty years in

243
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:51,862
the West and only went last year to USSR,
and You have more Sahaja yogis there than

244
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,392
You have all over the world.”

245
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:58,142
Not in India: we have many more, of course,
because they know about it, they were not

246
00:26:58,142 --> 00:27:00,842
ignorant, so it’s all right – if you forget
India.

247
00:27:00,842 --> 00:27:09,852
I don’t know what’s so special about them
that they could see this so clearly.

248
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:14,972
And one of the snags of Sahaja Yoga is that
you cannot pay for it.

249
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:22,872
And this really is the very great snag, I
think, because a gentleman from BBC in England

250
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:30,912
told Me that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand
anything that can be done without money.

251
00:27:30,912 --> 00:27:34,452
I said, “Who has made this brain, God or
somebody else?”

252
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,411
It’s very surprising!

253
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:45,051
And even in, I went to Toronto – no, Boston
– and they said, “How many Rolls-Royces

254
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:46,051
You’ve got?”

255
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:49,982
I said, “I have none, because I don’t
take any money.

256
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:52,122
Whatever I have is of My husband’s.”

257
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:55,652
They said, “Then we are not interested.

258
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:57,472
You have to be in the business.”

259
00:27:57,472 --> 00:28:03,801
It’s very shocking, this kind of a attitude
towards Divine.

260
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:12,821
I said, “How much money did you pay to Christ?”

261
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:19,412
Today also there was a question from a radio,
and they asked Me, “You don’t take any

262
00:28:19,412 --> 00:28:21,902
money; then how do You travel?”

263
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:28,821
I said, “So far, for quite some time I was
travelling with My husband’s money, no doubt.

264
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:34,281
But now we have so many Sahaja yogis and they
have some self-respect, and they don’t pay

265
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:38,412
Me, they pay to the travel agents, not to
Me.

266
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:44,311
They don’t want I to pay for them – then
tomorrow will say ‘all right, You pay for

267
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,002
our food also!’”

268
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:51,492
I mean, any self-respecting people can understand
that.

269
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:57,982
So if somebody does not take money, they go
to that limit that even I should pay for their

270
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:07,642
salvation, coming to their place I should
pay for the hall, I should pay for everything.

271
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:15,511
This kind of a brain – oh, it’s not all,
all of you are not Anglo-Saxon, I hope so!

272
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:20,071
– I can’t understand.

273
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,742
And that’s why it has not come up to the
point where it should have.

274
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:35,012
On the contrary, I must say Russians are very
brave people.

275
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:40,555
With the war they have become very strong.

276
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:46,811
On the contrary, in other countries I have
seen with the war they have become very nervous,

277
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:49,212
very frightened.

278
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:54,352
And immediately they took to Sahaja Yoga for
one point, that you cannot pay for it.

279
00:29:54,352 --> 00:30:01,102
They could see it, that you can’t pay because
it’s a living process.

280
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:04,322
Is such a wisdom that clicked.

281
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:16,171
You won’t believe, in England I was fighting
with seven hippies for four years: the questions,

282
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:19,372
the bombardment and – too much!

283
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:23,952
I was about to give up.

284
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:30,342
They just thought that it’s something to
be attacked.

285
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:34,468
And that’s the reason they attacked all
the saints, all the incarnations and all the

286
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,463
prophets.

287
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,679
But I hope now everybody realizes that we
are in trouble.

288
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,569
We are all in trouble.

289
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:51,110
We don’t know what’s going to happen next
day.

290
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:57,439
We might get into cancer, might get into some
other trouble.

291
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,169
We might have any problem that we do not know
about.

292
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:04,750
We are not sure of our future.

293
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:11,000
So it is better that we get our special energy
that is within us, we get ourselves enlightened

294
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:24,810
and take to something that will make us much
wiser, healthier, joyous and knowledgeable.

295
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:29,240
“Knowledge” does not mean what you know
through your brains, but on your central nervous

296
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,760
system.

297
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:41,540
That’s what everybody said, that the time
has come – it’s a blossom time, I call

298
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
it.

299
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,779
There are thousands and thousands who can
get realization.

300
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:53,240
It’s such a great blessing that we could
have en masse realization.

301
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,010
On the Tree of Life there would have been
only one or two flowers to begin with, but

302
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,159
today I call it a blossom time.

303
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:13,390
Is actually the Day of Judgment, but “blossom
time” seems better to say – is more promising.

304
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,438
I hope tonight we all will get realization
and enjoy ourselves.

305
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:30,191
May God bless you all.

306
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:45,392
Spirit is the source of knowledge, absolute
knowledge; is the source of peace, is the

307
00:32:45,392 --> 00:33:00,392
source of wisdom, is the source of joy, is
the source that enlightens our attention.

308
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:04,812
We have such a big property with us.

309
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:11,082
We should allow it to enlighten us, shouldn’t
we?

310
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:18,222
Now I think we should stop the questions,
because there’s one thing: I’m quite good

311
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:20,002
at answering questions.

312
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:29,122
I’ll answer all your questions, but by that
I cannot guarantee your realization.

313
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:34,042
I can answer most of your questions, but I
can’t guarantee your realization.

314
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,722
Realization has to work out.

315
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:41,122
So even if you have not been able to ask some
question, forget it.

316
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:47,642
You can bring them tomorrow written down,
and I would like to answer them when you come

317
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,162
tomorrow.

318
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,582
Beforehand if you give, I’ll answer them.

319
00:33:50,582 --> 00:33:54,412
But just now I think, tell your mind not to
bother you any more about questions.

320
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:59,322
And that’s why I wanted you to ask questions,
so that your mind should not suddenly come

321
00:33:59,322 --> 00:34:02,432
out like jack-in-the-box and say, “Oh, you
didn’t ask this question.

322
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,432
How can you have realization?”

323
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:14,692
So the most important thing is to get your
realization.

324
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,332
So I think, let us have it now.

325
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:20,222
Again, I cannot force on you.

326
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:25,242
You have to have it in your free will.

327
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:28,422
So please, those who want to have should be
there.

328
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:35,182
It will take hardly ten minutes to work it
out, and then tomorrow again I’m going to

329
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:36,922
work it out.

330
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:40,922
It’s very simple, very easy.

331
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:45,082
But those who don’t want to have it should
not be in the hall.

332
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,472
It’s not proper, it’s not civil.

333
00:34:47,472 --> 00:34:51,892
So all those who want to have it, are welcome.

334
00:34:51,892 --> 00:35:10,122
At the very outset, at the very outset there
are two conditions I have to tell you.

335
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:16,432
First one, as I told you before also, you
have to forget the past.

336
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:22,622
You have to forgive yourself, and know that
you are not guilty at all.

337
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:28,922
All these ideas are given to you that you
are sinful, you are guilty, you are this and

338
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:32,622
that because they wanted to cash it.

339
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:39,151
You don’t have to suffer either.

340
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:45,391
So first of all you should know that you must
forgive yourself and must have self-esteem

341
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:51,721
and you should be very pleasantly placed towards
yourself, because you are going to enter into

342
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:53,261
the Kingdom of God.

343
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:58,661
This is the first condition.

344
00:35:58,661 --> 00:36:05,501
Now the second condition is that you have
to forgive everyone.

345
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:11,550
Some will say it’s very difficult to forgive.

346
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:17,077
But whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

347
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:18,701
It’s a myth.

348
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:24,651
But if you don’t forgive then you really
play into the hands of the people who want

349
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:26,381
to torture you.

350
00:36:26,381 --> 00:36:29,051
So best is to forgive them, forget about them.

351
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:31,341
Forgive and forget.

352
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:35,011
But don’t start counting how many people
I have to forgive, what mistakes they have

353
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,381
done – nothing of the kind.

354
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:42,047
Just in general say “I forgive everyone”
– just, and it’s done.

355
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:47,954
Because Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,
it’s a very powerful ocean of forgiveness,

356
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:51,335
and you cannot do anything that it cannot
forgive.

357
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:58,045
And once you say “I forgive,” Divine takes
over; we don’t have to bother.

358
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:00,845
All right?

359
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,985
These are the two conditions we have; very
simple conditions, I think.

360
00:37:05,985 --> 00:37:09,790
We have to take out our shoes to take the
help of the Mother Earth.

361
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,275
That’s very important.

362
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:17,185
You have to put your left hand towards Me
like this, in a comfortable way, on your – you

363
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:23,555
can keep it on your lap, whatever is comfortable.

364
00:37:23,555 --> 00:37:29,125
Now this represents that you desire to have
your realization.

365
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,025
So you keep it all the time like this.

366
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:35,665
And with the right hand we’ll nourish our
centers.

367
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:40,405
With the right hand we will nourish our centers.

368
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:45,075
And so you will know also how to raise your
kundalini yourself.

369
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:52,835
So two things can be done: your kundalini
will be raised; as well as you will feel,

370
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:59,025
you will know how to feel your centers within
yourself and how to correct them.

371
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:04,945
We’ll be working only on the left-hand side.

372
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:07,115
So now you have to put the left hand towards
Me.

373
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:15,885
First I’ll show you, he will show you what
is to be done, and then you’ll have to close

374
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:20,875
your eyes later on.

375
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:25,805
First we’ll put our hand on our heart.

376
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:35,985
In the heart resides the spirit.

377
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:43,935
Then we’ll have to put our hand on the upper
portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

378
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:51,545
This is the center of your mastery, created
by great masters.

379
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:56,675
Then you have to take your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand

380
00:38:56,675 --> 00:39:04,705
side, which is a very important center which
manifests this pure knowledge on your central

381
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:10,225
nervous system.

382
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:23,575
Then you have to raise your hand higher, again
on to the left side of your abdomen, on the

383
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:24,575
upper part.

384
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:27,625
Press it hard, on the center of mastery.

385
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:32,525
Then to your heart again.

386
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:43,415
And then on to the corner between your neck
and your shoulder – from the front side,

387
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:48,615
not from the back but from the front side
– and turn your head to your right.

388
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:54,755
Now this center is very important, because
this catches on very much, specially in the

389
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,245
West, because people all the time feel guilty.

390
00:39:58,245 --> 00:40:05,495
And because of this people get spondylitis
and angina and all other lethargic organs

391
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:06,555
diseases.

392
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:15,485
So please put your hand here, as far back
as possible, and turn your head to your right.

393
00:40:15,485 --> 00:40:26,745
Now, take your right hand and put it on your
forehead across and try to put your head down

394
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:31,005
slowly, resting on this hand.

395
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:42,035
And now press it on both the sides, as we
do it when we have headache.

396
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:44,225
This is the center for forgiving others.

397
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:51,785
Then you have to take down your hand, take
up your hand onto the back side of your head

398
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:55,055
where the optic lobe is, here at the back.

399
00:40:55,055 --> 00:41:04,025
And now turn your head upward as far as possible,
resting on your hand.

400
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:09,135
This is the center where you have to ask for
forgiveness from the Divine without feeling

401
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:12,655
guilty – is for your satisfaction.

402
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:21,805
Now, stretch your hand, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm just on top

403
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:27,875
of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

404
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:36,485
And now bend your head, please, downward as
much as possible.

405
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:40,405
Push back your fingers, push back as much
as possible.

406
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:44,095
Now there will be a pressure on the scalp.

407
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:49,975
Now move this pressure on the scalp slowly
clockwise, seven times.

408
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:57,565
You have to move the scalp, not your hand
so much as the scalp, seven times clockwise,

409
00:41:57,565 --> 00:41:59,635
slowly.

410
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:02,925
Bend your head.

411
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:13,185
That’s what we’ll have to do.

412
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,025
That’s all, nothing more.

413
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:18,635
That’s the only thing we have to do.

414
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:23,315
Now, you can take out your spectacles if you
want because you’re closing your eyes, and

415
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:28,725
might help your eyesight also.

416
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:34,265
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.

417
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:37,865
Put your feet apart from each other.

418
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:51,515
And now put your right hand on your heart
and close your eyes.

419
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:58,475
Here you have to ask Me a very important question,
in your heart.

420
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:02,165
You ask Me a question as you would ask a computer.

421
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:08,515
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like.

422
00:43:08,515 --> 00:43:11,395
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

423
00:43:11,395 --> 00:43:13,785
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.

424
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:23,435
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

425
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:35,015
You have to only ask in your heart.

426
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:41,035
If you are the spirit you become your own
guide, you become your own master, you become

427
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,865
your own guru.

428
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:51,135
So now take down your right hand into the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand

429
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:54,905
side.

430
00:43:54,905 --> 00:44:06,575
And here you have to ask another question,
three times, not loudly, in your heart, “Mother,

431
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:08,695
am I the spirit?”

432
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:09,695
– ah!

433
00:44:09,695 --> 00:44:11,955
“Mother, am I my own master?

434
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:14,865
Mother, am I my own master?”

435
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:28,995
Ask this question three times.

436
00:44:28,995 --> 00:44:38,025
“Am I my own master?”

437
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:50,865
I have told you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

438
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:52,555
you.

439
00:44:52,555 --> 00:45:04,565
So please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen, and say it six times,

440
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:10,655
asking Me, “Mother, please give me pure
knowledge.”

441
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:12,685
I cannot force on you.

442
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:22,485
You have to ask in your free will.

443
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:42,685
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,
the kundalini starts moving upward.

444
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:55,715
So now we have to nourish the higher centers
with our self-confidence.

445
00:45:55,715 --> 00:46:04,455
Raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen.

446
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:09,425
Press it hard, on the left-hand side.

447
00:46:09,425 --> 00:46:17,055
And here with full confidence you have to
say ten times, in your heart, not loudly,

448
00:46:17,055 --> 00:46:20,305
“Mother, I am my own master.”

449
00:46:20,305 --> 00:46:47,425
Please say this ten times, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

450
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:55,015
I told you at the very outset that the greatest
truth about you is that you are not this body,

451
00:46:55,015 --> 00:47:05,115
you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings,
emotions, nor this ego, but you are the spirit.

452
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:08,455
You are the pure spirit.

453
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:28,225
So now raise your right hand onto your heart
and ask here, or say with full confidence,

454
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:32,365
twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

455
00:47:32,365 --> 00:47:40,675
Just say it without any hesitation.

456
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:55,215
Say it twelve times, please.

457
00:47:55,215 --> 00:48:12,145
For your information you have to know that
the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

458
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:17,895
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of
love.

459
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:26,085
It is the ocean of peace and ocean of bliss.

460
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:31,635
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

461
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:37,955
So you cannot commit any mistake which cannot
be dissolved by the power of this ocean of

462
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:40,385
forgiveness.

463
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:49,285
So please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck, on your shoulder, push it back

464
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:56,205
as much as possible and turn your head to
your right, and with full confidence please

465
00:48:56,205 --> 00:49:21,225
say sixteen times, full confidence, in your
heart, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

466
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:30,555
All right.

467
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:39,675
As I told you before that you have to forgive
everyone, and those who say it is difficult,

468
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:44,725
they must know that it is a myth whether you
forgive or don’t forgive.

469
00:49:44,725 --> 00:49:51,815
But if you don’t forgive then you play into
the wrong hands and get yourself tortured

470
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:53,605
by yourself.

471
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:58,695
So please forgive – in general, everyone,
not counting how many people you have to forgive,

472
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:06,455
what you have to forgive – but just say,
by raising your hand and putting it on top

473
00:50:06,455 --> 00:50:13,215
of your forehead across, putting down your
head as much as possible, resting on your

474
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:15,795
hand.

475
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:30,525
Please say, with an open heart please say,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

476
00:50:30,525 --> 00:50:40,975
Please say it, please say; otherwise it is
difficult later on for Me: I have to clear

477
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:45,075
out everybody’s Agnya and this takes too
much time then.

478
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,595
So best is to say it from your heart.

479
00:50:47,595 --> 00:50:56,365
After all, you are not going to miss your
Self-realization for that.

480
00:50:56,365 --> 00:51:07,855
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head, and put your head on it,

481
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:12,945
resting on it, upward.

482
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:20,585
Here you have to say for your own satisfaction,
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes,

483
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:21,885
please forgive me.”

484
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:26,525
But don’t feel guilty, don’t count your
mistakes, don’t think about them.

485
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:34,955
In general you have to say, “Oh Divine,
please forgive me if I have done any mistakes

486
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:42,065
or anything wrong, anything against You.”

487
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:51,165
Now, stretch your palm, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm on top of

488
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:57,805
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone
in your childhood.

489
00:51:57,805 --> 00:52:03,365
Now put down your head properly.

490
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:08,585
And here push back your fingers as far as
possible.

491
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:09,585
Please push back.

492
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,385
This is very important.

493
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:20,815
And now put a pressure on your scalp, and
move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

494
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:28,155
Here again I respect your freedom, and I cannot
force Self-realization on you.

495
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:35,915
So here you have to say seven times, bending
your head properly and pressing it hard, moving

496
00:52:35,915 --> 00:52:40,005
seven times, “Mother, please give me my
Self-realization.”

497
00:52:40,005 --> 00:52:43,835
Please ask seven times, please.

498
00:52:43,835 --> 00:53:11,425
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

499
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:46,515
Now, take down your hands and put them towards
Me, little higher.

500
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:52,595
Now, little bit put your right hand like this.

501
00:53:52,595 --> 00:54:01,115
Bend your head, and see for yourself if there
is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

502
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:06,245
But don’t touch it – above your head,
above your head.

503
00:54:06,245 --> 00:54:08,805
And some people get it far.

504
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:14,485
So just try to feel if there’s a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

505
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:21,055
Now, don’t start doubting that it’s air-conditioning
and all that – air-conditioning cannot come

506
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:22,965
out of your head!

507
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:27,885
So see for yourself.

508
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:36,725
Now, put
your left hand towards Me.

509
00:54:36,725 --> 00:54:46,455
Now again bend your head, and see for yourself
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

510
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:49,685
head.

511
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:56,135
All right?

512
00:54:56,135 --> 00:55:03,005
Now put your right hand again, and again bend
your head and see for yourself if there’s

513
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:05,475
a cool breeze coming out of your head.

514
00:55:05,475 --> 00:55:07,875
It might be hot also, doesn’t matter.

515
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:11,045
It may be heat coming out first and then the
cool breeze.

516
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:17,145
Doesn’t matter if it is hot, doesn’t matter.

517
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:23,925
Now, put your both the hands towards the sky
like this.

518
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:28,625
Bend back, and ask Me a question.

519
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:35,175
Three times, you can ask Me the question,
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the

520
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:36,635
Holy Ghost?

521
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:41,935
Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of
divine love?

522
00:55:41,935 --> 00:55:45,185
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

523
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:57,425
Ask any one of these questions three times.

524
00:55:57,425 --> 00:56:02,385
Now put down your hands.

525
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:05,115
Now watch Me without thinking.

526
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:11,685
You can do it.

527
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:19,165
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

528
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:26,685
whether cool or hot, please raise both your
hands – both.

529
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:28,595
Let’s see.

530
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:32,855
Just see the en masse, just see – wonderful!

531
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:36,475
So may God bless you all.

532
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:43,015
I bow to you all, because you have started
now your saintly life.

533
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:47,155
And all those who didn’t get also should
not get disappointed.

534
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:53,745
On the contrary, if time permits I would like
to meet the people who have felt the cool

535
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:58,744
breeze, and those who haven’t felt can come
on this side and the Sahaja yogis can work

536
00:56:58,744 --> 00:57:00,165
on them.

537
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:04,305
Again tomorrow you must come so you’ll be
fixed properly.

538
00:57:04,305 --> 00:57:10,475
Some, those who want to meet Me can come and
see Me, because there is some time, and in

539
00:57:10,475 --> 00:57:13,145
the meanwhile we can have some music.

540
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:17,025
Now don’t think about it.

541
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:19,605
If you start thinking, you’ll be lost.

542
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:22,465
Just don’t think about it; it’s beyond
thinking.

543
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:24,355
Thank you very much.

544
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:25,355
Thank you.

545
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:26,355
Beautiful!

546
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:27,355
Oh, My!

547
00:57:27,355 --> 00:57:28,355
Thank you.

548
00:57:28,355 --> 00:57:30,211
It’s beautiful flowers.

549
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:47,329
If you can push this apart, I’d like to
meet people.
