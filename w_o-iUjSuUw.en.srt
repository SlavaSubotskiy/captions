1
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,570
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,155
As I told you yesterday,

3
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:31,180
that truth is what it is.

4
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:37,592
We cannot understand it,

5
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:40,420
you have to feel it.

6
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,960
We cannot conceptualize it,

7
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,630
and you cannot feel it also

8
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,282
at this human awareness.

9
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,020
We have to become a subtler being,

10
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,700
as described in all the Scriptures,

11
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,880
that you are to be born again

12
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,800
and that you have to become the Spirit,

13
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,635
to feel the existence of Truth.

14
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,949
First thing, we have to understand,

15
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,401
that all this is a process

16
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:30,609
of a living energy.

17
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,300
Divine is a living energy,

18
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,330
and divinity within you also is a living energy.

19
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,000
We do not understand sometimes what is a living energy.

20
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:53,535
When we sow a seed in the ground,

21
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,049
they sprout by themselves.

22
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,490
When a mother conceives the child,

23
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:06,307
according to the normal nature of human beings,

24
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:12,064
their body has to expel everything that is foreign.

25
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,875
But when the child is conceived,

26
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:19,209
it is not only kept in the body

27
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,000
but is nourished, looked after, developed,

28
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,130
and at the right time it is expelled.

29
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,290
There are so many other things which cannot be explained

30
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,330
through medical science.

31
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,193
But one must know that to understand what I am saying,

32
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,774
you must have an open mind,

33
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:49,521
like a scientist has.

34
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,891
And if you find what I am saying,

35
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,639
which is like a hypothesis,

36
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,120
is true and gives you the experience of the truth,

37
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,482
then as honest people you must accept it,

38
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:10,050
because it is for your emancipation

39
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,077
and for the emancipation of the whole world.

40
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,516
In our evolutionary process now we have become human beings,

41
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:23,530
but as you know we have not achieved the absoluteness.

42
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,970
For that something has to happen within us:

43
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,990
the last breakthrough has to take place,

44
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:38,394
and that is what we are talking about here.

45
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,930
You have been already told about the mechanism that is here.

46
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,919
And this mechanism exists within you,

47
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,069
these two lines that you see, left and right,

48
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,810
are nourishing our left and right sympathetic nervous system.

49
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,560
And the central one that you see here

50
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,683
is nourishing our parasympathetic nervous system.

51
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:13,639
Now these centers are

52
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,476
created by these two sides,

53
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:21,164
left and the right like this in the center,

54
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,500
and these centers

55
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,289
are all the time exhausted by us

56
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,380
whenever we try to use energy.

57
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,920
For example, if you are running fast

58
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,086
you can increase the heart rate,

59
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:43,210
but it comes to its normal self

60
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,120
through the parasympathetic nervous system,

61
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,546
while in emergency you use your sympathetic nervous system.

62
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:56,689
Thus, we start exhausting the energy of these centers,

63
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,309
and that’s how we get into problems

64
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,525
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

65
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,795
Supposing we are exhausting the energy on the right-hand side

66
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:11,400
means you are very futuristic,

67
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,400
you are planning all the time, thinking of the future

68
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,700
then what happens, the right side starts moving like this.

69
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,969
And something happens on the left side, a shock, then it breaks.

70
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,960
When it breaks, then we lose our connection

71
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,300
with the central nervous system;

72
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,557
that means we lose our connection with our brain that controls it

73
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,520
and we become on our own.

74
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,729
And that’s how psychosomatic troubles start, specially cancer,

75
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,290
and the malignancy sets in.

76
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,139
When the Kundalini rises from there,

77
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,009
She goes through this center as well as this center,

78
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,490
pushes them together and nourishes them.

79
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,439
Now let us see

80
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,449
what is the quality of all these centers within us.

81
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,300
This is all within us, and we have to see

82
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,409
that how we exist with the energy of these centers.

83
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,480
The first center that you see is down below.

84
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,035
This center which is down below,

85
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,569
is below the Kundalini,

86
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,979
and so we have to understand that

87
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,100
this center supports the rising of the Kundalini,

88
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:30,570
but it's not pierced through by the Kundalini.

89
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,600
This center is

90
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,822
for all our excretion,

91
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,700
even sex.

92
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,680
So those people who say that through sex

93
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,570
you can raise your Kundalini,

94
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,519
they are absolutely wrong and are misleading you.

95
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,239
Because you can see here clearly, it is below that.

96
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,700
This is the center of innocence,

97
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,916
is the center

98
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:00,999
where we say that the deity of innocence is sitting here,

99
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
who incarnated later on as Christ

100
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,380
on the higher center there

101
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,960
between, where you see this [lying], my red spot,

102
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,417
is one of the windows.

103
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:15,703
It is on the optic chiasma.

104
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,319
And that’s how we say that

105
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,636
Christ was the incarnation of innocence.

106
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:27,995
Because He is sitting on the optic chiasma,

107
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,566
He said that,

108
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,272
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

109
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,280
This is the sentence He has used.

110
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,340
To such a subtle way He has suggested

111
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,900
that you will not have adulterous eyes,

112
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,641
meaning you will have very pure eyes,

113
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,799
innocent eyes.

114
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,850
Why did He talk of the eyes?

115
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,480
Because He’s sitting on the optic chiasma.

116
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,820
It’s a very constricted center,

117
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,799
and He was to be resurrected

118
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
to show that you can also pass through

119
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,299
that center very easily.

120
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,000
So His message is not His crucifixion, but His resurrection.

121
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,170
And that is how we are all going to resurrected,

122
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,060
not after death, but right now.

123
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,991
We should not postpone our resurrection any more.

124
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,020
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

125
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,320
which is called as the Swadisthana.

126
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,425
This center looks after physical

127
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,552
and our mental activities.

128
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,930
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

129
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,106
that it has a very important work to do,

130
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:54,809
is that it has to nourish the brain

131
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,229
with new cells,

132
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,479
because all the time the brain is using

133
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,780
these cells for its activity.

134
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,380
So the energy has to go from this center,

135
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,869
up there you can see

136
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,739
and then it nourishes the center,

137
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,596
it nourishes the brain

138
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:21,929
through its activity.

139
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,049
Now when we are very futuristic

140
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,833
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

141
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,940
too much of our brain activity we have,

142
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,544
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

143
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,540
thinking too much, all the time thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

144
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,970
that time we are using the energy of this center.

145
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:45,980
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

146
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,000
that it goes round, as you see,

147
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,940
it moves all round here

148
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,580
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

149
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,140
and it moves round and round and round,

150
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,280
and gives energy to this area

151
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,200
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

152
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,380
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

153
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,449
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

154
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,250
then the main work of this center suffers

155
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,400
and that’s how we develop all these diseases of all these organs:

156
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,309
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

157
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,290
Liver problem means that liver has a function

158
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,489
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

159
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,380
into the bloodstream.

160
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:43,290
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

161
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,289
the heat is retained in the liver.

162
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,877
It passes upward and downward.

163
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:51,249
When it passes upward it affects

164
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,891
a center there, as you can see, which we call as the right heart,

165
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:58,479
and people develop what we call the disease as asthma.

166
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,000
And when it passes downwards

167
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,189
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

168
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,849
and you get kidney troubles,

169
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,501
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

170
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:16,788
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

171
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,759
At the same time this heat can also pass,

172
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,897
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

173
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:26,297
and puts in too much of physical efforts

174
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:29,327
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

175
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:32,880
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

176
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,610
because this heat can go towards his heart

177
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,259
and just collapse it.

178
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,280
Also those people work very hard like that

179
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,893
can get a very massive heart attack.

180
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:46,309
But the people who have other problems,

181
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,226
on the left-hand side, are different type.

182
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,713
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

183
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,992
These organs do not work,

184
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,969
and when they do not work

185
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,140
then they have all the other problems

186
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,200
of the left side, as we call it;

187
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,979
and this also causes another serious problem

188
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,440
of psychosomatic troubles.

189
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,120
Now the essence of this center

190
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,427
is that it is creativity.

191
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,520
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

192
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,720
people become extremely creative.

193
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,600
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

194
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,570
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

195
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,560
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

196
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,900
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

197
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,450
The most surprising thing is that people,

198
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,580
say, even from Switzerland

199
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,770
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

200
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,825
who do not know a word of Hindi language

201
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,460
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

202
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,240
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

203
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,139
It's impossible to believe that even the English

204
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,027
who were so difficult to even pronounce

205
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:56,740
one sentence in Hindi language,

206
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,940
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit and talking all these things;

207
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,966
because of this creativity improves you.

208
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:08,330
We have so many artists in India who came to Sahaja Yoga,

209
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,440
I don’t know if you know their names or not

210
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,730
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

211
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,252
They got their Realization

212
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:18,769
and after that, now today they are very well-known artists.

213
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,460
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

214
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,920
who became quite good artists,

215
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,840
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,569
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

217
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,720
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

218
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,388
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

219
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:44,920
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

220
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,555
or if you want to do something,

221
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:50,000
mouldings or anything that you want to do

222
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,120
if you have the technique,

223
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,920
the creativity, the power of creativity starts pouring in you,

224
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,733
and you start producing things

225
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:02,170
on which you cannot even have thought of,

226
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,340
and these things happen to a person.

227
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,939
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

228
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:12,570
But if with that you do not keep your Sahaja Yoga practice,

229
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,529
means if you do not keep your connection with the Divine,

230
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,080
then the energy gets exhausted.

231
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,880
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

232
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,650
for every artist,

233
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,400
that he should get his connection

234
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,420
with this All-pervading Power

235
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,160
which is the combination of all the powers,

236
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,060
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

237
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,535
Not only that, but all the time this source is flowing into him.

238
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:43,140
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why you have to do

239
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,097
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

240
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:47,910
after getting your Realization, as I told you yesterday,

241
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,120
that now you don’t stop at this point,

242
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,380
you have to make the connection perfect.

243
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:55,103
Without the connection,

244
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:58,159
it may be that you may go down.

245
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,438
So it’s best is to keep your connection on and work it out,

246
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,840
to give full respect to yourself,

247
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,739
to your being.

248
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,290
You are not an ordinary thing,

249
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,750
you are not a chicken or something like that.

250
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,369
You are a human being.

251
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,730
And the beauty that is within you is to be discovered,

252
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,463
is to be nourished

253
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,080
and to be proud of.

254
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,697
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

255
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:28,849
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.

256
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,640
Now above that is the, you see the third center.

257
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,934
which is called as Nabhi, means the navel.

258
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,520
This is the center of

259
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,280
the way we absorb the virtues,

260
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,080
or the virtues are enlightened.

261
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,490
When this center is enlightened

262
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,290
we really become righteous.

263
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,360
We don’t have to tell, “Now you don’t do this and don’t do that”.

264
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,964
You just become.

265
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:01,409
Like a saint, a real saint,

266
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,800
will not do wrong things.

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,609
In the same way when a person gets his Realization,

268
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,070
by the virtue of this center,

269
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,620
he becomes absolutely balanced:

270
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,300
balanced with his family life, with his wife, with his children,

271
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,170
balanced with the politics, economics,

272
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,200
balanced with the society,

273
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,610
balanced with all the people whom he knows;

274
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,980
in a very balancing way he starts behaving.

275
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,519
There’s not one-sided activity.

276
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,163
For example, somebody may be very much attached to the wife

277
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,620
and may try to harm others.

278
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,727
Somebody who is very much attached to others,

279
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,241
may harm his wife.

280
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,660
So a kind of a balance is established by this,

281
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,370
and a person who gets this

282
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,129
develops a personality which we call as regal.

283
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,170
That sense of dignity comes into such a person.

284
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,829
Now you see our children have lost the virtues,

285
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,400
our children don’t have that regalty.

286
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,715
They have become very cheapish also,

287
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:08,463
and they run after materialism and things like that;

288
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,495
they fight for small, small things.

289
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,560
It’s not only children, even the grown-ups are like that

290
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
and they try to waste their energy,

291
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,420
fighting for something that is so useless.

292
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,544
So by enlightenment of this center

293
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:25,260
you understand the value of matter.

294
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,840
And the value of matter is this:

295
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,240
that it has aesthetics, first of all,

296
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,110
and secondly, you can express your love only through matter.

297
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,240
If you love somebody you’ll give them something,

298
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,240
a little flower also can express your love.

299
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,200
Anything can express your love through matter,

300
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
and then you become a very generous

301
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,010
and very enjoyable person.

302
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,687
Some people feel

303
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:52,919
that if you become generous, you will be bankrupt.

304
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,061
It’s not so. On the contrary,

305
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:58,550
if you open one door, no air will come in,

306
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,724
but if you open the other door, all the air will start circulating.

307
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,090
In the same way, when a person is generous

308
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,671
he starts getting so many blessings -

309
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:12,352
because he is also connected with the Divine - that he is amazed.

310
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:15,000
He doesn’t know what to do with the things that he has got,

311
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,050
and then he starts pouring it to others.

312
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,738
There are so many things people are telling Me about,

313
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:22,751
miracles and miracles of even material things

314
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:26,880
in their jobs, in their purchasing, in their shopping,

315
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,720
the way they have seen miracles happening

316
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,010
that it is nothing but just

317
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,170
that this center is enlightened.

318
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,680
And with this center, within you a righteousness comes in.

319
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,029
And this righteousness doesn’t force anybody else,

320
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,294
it’s just righteousness itself which doesn’t command anything

321
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,087
or demand anything,

322
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:54,285
but it becomes a respectable personality,

323
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:57,730
and you just start really understanding

324
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,119
that, “Look at this man”.

325
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,252
Somebody was telling Me today that in the office people asked,

326
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,720
“How are you so dignified?”

327
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,740
He said, “I didn’t know I was so dignified.”

328
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,940
"No, you don’t do anything undignified,

329
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,440
and you do everything just like a child also".

330
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,450
So there’s a child-like dignity you develop,

331
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,000
and it’s a beautiful thing to happen, really it’s angelic.

332
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,909
Now then there, we have another center on top,

333
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,139
which we call as the heart center.

334
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,370
It is in the center.

335
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,739
Now in the sternum bone, behind the sternum bone

336
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,220
this center is there,

337
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:33,993
and thymus produces the antibodies

338
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:35,759
in your sternum bone.

339
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,631
These antibodies, later on, fight your diseases.

340
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,519
When you are about twelve years of age

341
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,178
they go into the whole body, and waiting there,

342
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:51,286
for a signal from your sternum bone.

343
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,198
That means supposing you see something, you get frightened,

344
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:56,045
this bone starts pulsating.

345
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,480
When it pulsates, the antibodies know there’s some emergency,

346
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,719
and they get prepared for it.

347
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,188
Now this is such a normal thing to happen to people.

348
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,050
But the insecurities can be of the worst type,

349
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,780
and when these insecurities develop,

350
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,780
people can develop all kinds of diseases of the lungs;

351
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,530
specially the women develop

352
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,980
what you call as the breast cancer.

353
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,810
Mostly these women are insecure:

354
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,740
maybe their husbands are not good, or they feel

355
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,730
that the husband may leave them alone or something like that.

356
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,650
There are certain insecurities that are built in.

357
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,760
They might be quite frightened people, personalities.

358
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,959
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

359
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,059
have this center heart catching,

360
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,096
because they are afraid they may miss the plane or I don’t know,

361
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:43,780
they have to be on the job and run and do.

362
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,560
Mostly these time-bound jobs

363
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,080
cause you a trouble here of the center heart,

364
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,860
and this center heart is very important,

365
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,760
because for women specially, they have to be secured.

366
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,100
If their motherhood is challenged then they are even worse.

367
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,404
And this is how one has to understand,

368
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,850
a woman should be very much respected

369
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,350
if she is your wife, she’s your child or anything.

370
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:10,770
She has to be respected and given all the security.

371
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,890
It’s the woman who makes the society,

372
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,800
it's the woman who creates the children,

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,119
it's the woman who looks after the children.

374
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,049
So the men have to give all the security and the protection

375
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,400
to the womenhood and understand that is a very important factor,

376
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,080
which if we neglect we can have lots of problems with our society;

377
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,660
and the women will start competing with men

378
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,180
and then the society will be all dislocated.

379
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,410
So the center on the left side and the right side

380
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,560
are the centers of your father, of your mother and your father.

381
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,890
If there’s any problem with your father,

382
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,120
then the right side catches and it gives you asthma.

383
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,574
First of all you are, we can say,

384
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,760
vulnerable to asthma, due to bad liver.

385
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,639
Plus if you have problems with your father

386
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,460
or if with your fatherhood -

387
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,380
supposing you are an unhappy father,

388
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,290
or maybe that you are not looking after your children,

389
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,060
then you get this center caught up very badly.

390
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,175
Then on the left side is the mother’s,

391
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:12,079
and the mother’s thing is that when some mothers

392
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,097
are not good mothers; also children can get this.

393
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:21,220
Or when the children are not nice to the mother, they also get it.

394
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,740
So mother and father are very important factors in Sahaja Yoga,

395
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,945
and you have to understand

396
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,016
that if your parents have been unkind to you,

397
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,495
you must forgive them. Just forget about them.

398
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:36,158
Because they have given you birth, you should be thankful,

399
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,850
and just forget about them.

400
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,770
That’s the best way to get over the problem of left and right heart.

401
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,280
Then we have, on top, if you see, is this chakra

402
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,459
which we call as the Vishuddhi chakra.

403
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,740
This Vishuddhi chakra is, has got sixteen petals,

404
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,160
and looks after our ear, nose, eyes, throat, everything.

405
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,690
Our face, everything is looked after by this center.

406
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,780
Now this center also has left and right.

407
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,490
All centers have left and right

408
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,970
and when you feel guilty

409
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,580
the left center catches,

410
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,396
which is a very dangerous thing

411
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:15,370
because this gives you diseases like angina,

412
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,609
or maybe diseases like spondylitis and lethargic organs.

413
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,360
Right when a person is very aggressive, talks very aggressively,

414
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,050
and tries to dominate others,

415
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,155
and use his power of speech to show off,

416
00:28:32,356 --> 00:28:33,756
the right side catches.

417
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:37,740
The reactions of this can be many, that the hands gets frozen,

418
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,900
and they also get the cancer of the throat;

419
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,760
all kinds of things can happen

420
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,120
with this chakra being in trouble.

421
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,040
Now then we go to the chakra here, in between the optic chiasma.

422
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,010
It is placed like this, and it’s absolutely closed.

423
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,065
It is when you forgive.

424
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,694
Christ has said that you have to forgive.

425
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,469
When you forgive

426
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,864
everyone and also when

427
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,840
you ask for forgiveness,

428
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,600
this chakra opens like this.

429
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,433
Otherwise it cannot open.

430
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:15,812
We saw yesterday that some people,

431
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:18,440
at least there were ten, fifteen people

432
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,410
who never got their Realization, because they had not forgiven.

433
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,370
Then when I put My hand, worked on them and it worked.

434
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,660
But it’s very simple to forgive,

435
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,660
because whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

436
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,413
you don’t do anything, it’s a myth,

437
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:32,768
it’s absolutely a myth that you don’t forgive.

438
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,930
But for that myth you suffered so much.

439
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,690
So you have to forgive, to open this center of Agnya.

440
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,370
It’s very important and is,

441
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,410
the deity on that is Jesus Christ.

442
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,280
Then you enter into the area called limbic area

443
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,340
which is on top, which is called as Sahasrara in Sanskrit,

444
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,288
means there are one thousand petals.

445
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,560
These look like

446
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,420
“tongues of flames” as described in the Bible.

447
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,540
All of them look like “tongues of flames”

448
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,369
but in the brain they are of seven colors,

449
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,596
beautifully, very silently, peacefully

450
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:15,929
opening, closing, opening, closing.

451
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,040
So when the Kundalini goes into the limbic area

452
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,966
it enlightens your brain, it enlightens.

453
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,490
And as I told yesterday there are many children

454
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,106
who have been dullards, have now

455
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,917
records in their examination,

456
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:32,796
and they have put so much of

457
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:35,739
new dimension to their understanding,

458
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,220
that their teachers, their professors are surprised.

459
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,020
This is what happens when the brain,

460
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,040
which is used very little, starts getting enlightened.

461
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,809
Automatically you start using it.

462
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,720
Then it pierces through the fontanel bone area,

463
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,180
which is a very soft bone,

464
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,709
through which this Kundalini comes out.

465
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:02,699
I told you yesterday that Kundalini is your mother,

466
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,220
individual mother,

467
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,010
and she is the power of pure desire.

468
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
All other desires that we have are impure.

469
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,016
Today we want to have, say, a chair,

470
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:19,479
then we want to have a table, then we want to have a house, then...

471
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,146
We are never satisfied, we go from one to another;

472
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:27,449
and it is a principle of economics that

473
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,650
wants are not satiable in general.

474
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,220
So what is that want which is satiable?

475
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,320
Is this want, this pure desire.

476
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,867
And what is the pure desire,

477
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:39,579
is to be one with this divine power.

478
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,260
Whether you know it or not,

479
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,169
whether you are aware of it or not,

480
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,460
it exists in all the human beings

481
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,800
and the only thing that has to be done is

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,130
it is to be awakened

483
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,449
and to be connected to this All-pervading Power.

484
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,303
So the truth is that

485
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:59,155
you are not this body, not this mind,

486
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:02,319
not these conditionings or ego,

487
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,579
but you are the pure Spirit.

488
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,570
And the second one, is that with this All-pervading Power,

489
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,680
which is a wonderful thing,

490
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,370
is impossible to describe it in this short lecture of Mine

491
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,479
but it’s the one which organizes,

492
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,650
which does all the living work.

493
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,200
To the minutest things it organizes,

494
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,788
so complicated everything is,

495
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,646
but it manages all that.

496
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,182
Not only, but above all,

497
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:32,969
it forgives and it loves.

498
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,860
So such a beautiful power is all around us,

499
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,910
so why should we have any worry?

500
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,940
And now we have to know

501
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,013
that yesterday we had lots of questions,

502
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:44,680
and nice questions were there.

503
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,540
Today also I would like you to ask Me questions.

504
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,118
But in asking questions, please remember

505
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,197
not to ask “What is Your opinion about this person or that person?”

506
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:56,121
Of course, now you must have known that I condemn all the people

507
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:59,090
who take money in the name of God; absolutely openly.

508
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,121
So please don’t ask Me questions about such people.

509
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:06,600
Moreover, you ask questions which are related to our subject,

510
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,420
because I have come here

511
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,210
not to get anything out of you,

512
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,250
but to give you what is your own:

513
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,400
your beauty, your divinity, your glory.

514
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,941
And then you will be surprised

515
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:21,479
that the first thing that happens to you

516
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,056
is a new awareness, it's a new dimension

517
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:26,819
in your awareness comes in

518
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,850
and this awareness is called as collective consciousness,

519
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,570
by which you feel others on your fingertips.

520
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,060
Who is the other then?

521
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:41,409
Also within yourself you can feel what’s wrong with you.

522
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,150
Only thing, you have to be decoding these signals

523
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,848
and you should know how to correct it.

524
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:50,930
This is what has to happen, which is very simple.

525
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,850
Within a month’s time you can become your own masters,

526
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,000
and you know how to treat yourself and how to look after yourself.

527
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,940
I’m sorry I am here in only for today.

528
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,770
Tomorrow I have to go to Canberra.

529
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,220
And in this lecture,

530
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,930
whatever was possible in short, I've tried to tell you

531
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,930
about this great mechanism that is within us.

532
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:14,599
But by this you achieve so many beautiful things,

533
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,303
as I told you yesterday,

534
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:19,509
that you achieve the peace,

535
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,691
you achieve the witness state,

536
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,250
you achieve the collective consciousness,

537
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:26,452
you achieve

538
00:34:26,786 --> 00:34:32,459
the light in your attention, which acts.

539
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,114
You pay attention to something, it acts, it works.

540
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,960
Then you get the power that you can raise the Kundalini of others.

541
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,009
Like one light enlightened can enlighten another light.

542
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,520
Then it gives you a complete idea

543
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,018
about yourself and about others.

544
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,547
Above all, you get an absolute knowledge

545
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,530
about everything.

546
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,956
When you have the absolute knowledge, there’s no quarrel, no war,

547
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:06,209
because everybody knows it on their fingertips.

548
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,520
To know on your central nervous system is the real bodha,

549
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,783
from where the word Buddha has come,

550
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:15,699
is the "vida", from where the word Vedas has come.

551
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Gnostics, “gn”: “gn” means “jnana”. “Jnana” means the knowledge.

552
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,395
And the knowledge is not mental knowledge,

553
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:25,850
but the knowledge on your central nervous system.

554
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,260
Whatever we have achieved in our ascent as human beings,

555
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,820
we have got all this on our central nervous system.

556
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,769
For example, you take a dog or a horse through a dirty place,

557
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,548
he can pass through easily;

558
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,274
but a human being cannot pass,

559
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,569
because he has developed a new awareness about it.

560
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,279
He knows what is beauty is, he knows what virtues are,

561
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,509
he knows what is sin is.

562
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,330
For an animal there is no sin, he’ll do whatever he likes,

563
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,676
because he’s completely under the control of the Divine.

564
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,479
But for human beings there’s freedom,

565
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,320
and he has to judge it with trial and error

566
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,510
and reach a point to understand

567
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,460
that he has to get to a higher awareness.

568
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,467
May God bless you all.

569
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:37,625
Thank you.

570
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,172
You have to ask the questions. I think they are all forgotten!

571
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,425
Are melanomas and skin-cancers

572
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,980
caused by a blockage in a chakra?

573
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,123
Yes, all. Of course,

574
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:21,025
all our diseases are because of the blockage in the chakras,

575
00:37:21,226 --> 00:37:22,249
no doubt.

576
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,810
But see now, if you have to treat a tree

577
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,000
and you start putting the medicine on the leaves,

578
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,850
it will never be cured. You have to go to the roots.

579
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,540
And because it is at the roots, it’s so simple.

580
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,505
Only there are seven chakras and three nadis

581
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:41,647
means about twenty-one permutations and combinations,

582
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,324
you have to work out, that’s all.

583
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:05,428
In meditation, where should we put our consciousness in the body?

584
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,400
You don’t have to do anything, you just get into it.

585
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,480
When the Kundalini crosses over this center,

586
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,840
immediately you become thoughtlessly aware.

587
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,490
That’s a state when you are in the present,

588
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,980
neither in the future, not in the past.

589
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,199
and then the growth, spiritual growth starts working it out.

590
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,219
And suddenly you will find one day

591
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,497
that you have touched that depth of your divinity.

592
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,140
You don’t have to direct yourself at all.

593
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,740
The Kundalini itself directs.

594
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,810
Yes?

595
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,208
Mother, I'd like to know the relationship

596
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:03,813
between what is happening in the world in terms of the pollution

597
00:39:04,014 --> 00:39:07,233
and the damage that's been [unclear] and harms us

598
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:10,261
Is there an object, a lesson for mankind in that?

599
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:12,765
And I suppose, most, most of us would say "yes",

600
00:39:12,966 --> 00:39:15,711
but what is the spiritual aspect of what we are doing to our world,

601
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,244
[what is spiritually to be done]?

602
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:21,333
- What's this?
What is the spiritual significance

603
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:25,409
on what we are doing to our world in the sense of pollution?

604
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,208
Yes, spiritual aspect is that we do not have a balance.

605
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,569
Now once we start a machine,

606
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,129
then machine has to produce, go on producing like mad.

607
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,279
It produces more and more.

608
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,689
Then the accent is on money, not on Spirit.

609
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,273
So what happens?

610
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,930
That they produce more and more things

611
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,250
and they create an atmosphere through advertisement, this, that

612
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:56,739
and everybody starts running for it.

613
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,420
Then we have accumulation of so much of rubbish,

614
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,449
and what you have done is that you have exhausted the Mother Earth.

615
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,240
But when you get your Realization and when you are spiritual,

616
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,090
then what happens, you buy very few things,

617
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,089
but very good things.

618
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,938
You don’t run after the fashions or anything,

619
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:19,089
but you make a dress

620
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,560
which is good for you, which is decent for you,

621
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,960
and may not be one hundred dresses,

622
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,160
maybe five or six,

623
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,089
but very beautiful, dignified, artistic dresses.

624
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,051
In the same way now, supposing

625
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,500
I tell you that “you don’t drink any alcohol,”

626
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,339
you will all run away. But I don’t say that.

627
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,540
After Sahaja Yoga, people just don’t drink.

628
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,610
Now your money is saved by that.

629
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:51,381
But also what is saved in that is

630
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:57,300
the amount of paraphernalia you need for a drinking party!

631
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,603
First time, in India I never used to serve any drinks in My house,

632
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:08,021
but C.P. said, "In England You have to do it”.

633
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:10,015
My husband said,“You have to do it there” .

634
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:12,170
I said, “All right, that’s your lookout, not Mine”.

635
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,941
So he got hold of a dictionary, you see,

636
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,608
a French dictionary, to find out

637
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,299
what all we have to buy to begin with.

638
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,054
So you’ll be amazed, at that time -

639
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:26,982
it was in 1973 we went to London, yes -

640
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:28,746
and he said that,

641
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:33,398
“At least we’ll have to pay nine hundred pounds,

642
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,210
to get the best quality tumblers”.

643
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,229
I said, “Nine hundred pounds for what?” He said,

644
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:43,219
“For everything you have to have a different type of a tumbler.”

645
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,370
I said, “Really, but for what? What is the need?”

646
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,310
He said, “That’s the custom, that’s the norm”.

647
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,040
So you see, also the norms that we have created

648
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,947
are so stupid. There is no need.

649
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,020
Instead of that in India supposing you are well off, all right,

650
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:03,199
they’ll have six tumblers made of silver,

651
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,000
which they’ll pass on from father to son,

652
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,740
son to his son, and that’s all.

653
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,170
You won’t need many things.

654
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,682
Or plates now; so you’ll have first course, then a second course,

655
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:20,759
and a third course, and then you start moving

656
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,060
with all your cutlery this way, then this way, then this way,

657
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,346
and really you don’t know what to do with it.

658
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,229
So there’s no need to do all that.

659
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,710
There’s no need, you see, to do it.

660
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,599
What is the necessity, you see?

661
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,217
But you could be simple, you could use your fingers, is the best,

662
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:41,318
because after Realization you have vibrations in your hands,

663
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,769
divine vibrations.

664
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,631
So you start using your hands,

665
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:49,090
and you can use a one nice plate of brass

666
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,800
or of silver, in that same amount.

667
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,280
You see, six plates of silver

668
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,299
cost you the same as this elaborate, say, a dinner-set

669
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,259
which is always, I would say,

670
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,800
has to be replaced because it breaks, this happens, that happens.

671
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,480
And the same plates you can pass on to other people.

672
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:15,980
There are so many things, we waste our time.

673
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:20,250
Now if you go to a lady’s apartment,

674
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,190
you will be surprised that the whole place will be filled

675
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,541
with this Elizabeth Arden, this, that, that, that.

676
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:29,649
You open something, it all falls on you.

677
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,873
And then you say, “Why have you got so many?”

678
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:33,823
“No, Mother, this is gone out of fashion.”

679
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:36,480
“Baba, whatever it was good for your skin,

680
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,560
whatever was once good for you, use that throughout”.

681
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,360
“No, but they are changing every time.”

682
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,200
I said, “But you decide what you want to use it,

683
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,700
and use that thing all through.

684
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,160
What’s the use of filling these cupboards with all this?”

685
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,885
You see, we were in London, we were searching out houses

686
00:43:54,086 --> 00:43:57,960
and I mean, horrible, I tell you, the experiences were.

687
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,660
You go into any house and suddenly you’ll find

688
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,880
two legs of the pants falling on, to your [room].

689
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,664
And then you look up and there’s a pile of things

690
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:07,280
kept on the top of the loft.

691
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,880
Just the loft is overfilled with all the clothes.

692
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,879
And so much was filled.

693
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,080
I tell you, Australians are much more neater people,

694
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:18,260
but if you go to England you’ll be shocked,

695
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,683
because they are the buyers,

696
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:23,770
for ages they have been buying, buying, buying, buying,

697
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,200
and there’s no place for human beings to live inside.

698
00:44:26,401 --> 00:44:28,974
They live outside,

699
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,831
in the Hyde Park!

700
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:35,145
They are sitting in the Hyde Park. If you ask them,

701
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:39,053
“Why are you here?”, “Our house are overfull”.

702
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,640
So you develop the balance.

703
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,129
And because of this lack of balance,

704
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:50,185
there is ecological problem.

705
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,123
Is Kundalini to be developed

706
00:44:56,323 --> 00:45:00,025
within certain age of human existence

707
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:04,130
or can it be developed any age?

708
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,368
Is the Kundalini to be developed

709
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,175
you know, at a certain age in human existence,

710
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:16,300
or can it be developed at any age?

711
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,159
At any age. There’s nothing like that.

712
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,997
There’s no age, no time, nothing. It’s beyond all that.

713
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,340
Even so many children are born realized these days.

714
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,890
Sahaja Yogis get the children, when they marry,

715
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:34,330
they get children who are already born realized.

716
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,169
They are so wise, you know, very wise,

717
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,850
and they come and have a conference with Me very special.

718
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,953
And then they tell Me about all the uncle and aunties,

719
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:47,960
what’s wrong with their chakras.

720
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:53,099
They are My great friends, I should say;

721
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,001
but very wise, you know.

722
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,130
She was recently told that she should never meditate

723
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,700
unless she’s had a glass of water.

724
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,934
- Should I? For Me?
- This is neccessary...

725
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:30,089
- For Me?
- No, no, anyone meditating.

726
00:46:30,297 --> 00:46:33,424
- I didn’t understand, what is it?
- Nor did I.

727
00:46:34,764 --> 00:46:39,200
She said she was recently told that she shouldn’t meditate

728
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:42,450
until she’s had a glass of water.

729
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,112
Are you? Sahaja Yogis told you that?

730
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:48,449
Yes, [finding how]...

731
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,199
See, sometimes what happens, supposing you are a liver patient,

732
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,090
then the heat might be generated out of your head, you see,

733
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,099
like a chimney it opens out.

734
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,944
So if you take little water,

735
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,820
the heat won’t feel so much. May be that.

736
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,130
But I get the heat from all the rest of the people,

737
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:09,335
and I go on drinking water all the time to cool Myself, too.

738
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:23,200
There are so many different forms of meditation.

739
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,720
Does any sort of meditation work?

740
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,139
No, no, it does not. We do not meditate,

741
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,345
we have to be in meditation.

742
00:47:31,546 --> 00:47:33,849
There’s difference between the two.

743
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,740
You do not meditate before Realization;

744
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,379
after Realization you are in meditation.

745
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,880
So you become thoughtlessly aware.

746
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,330
So when you meditate in Sahaja Yoga

747
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,850
you become thoughtlessly aware,

748
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:52,340
and then you start growing into a new awareness

749
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,800
or a higher awareness

750
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,919
which you call as doubtless awareness,

751
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,260
and that is how you start growing.

752
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,290
So the meditation is that you get into meditation,

753
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:05,920
you don’t do meditation.

754
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,779
This one.

755
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,995
If you are one of these people that are thinking all the time

756
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:14,228
and you are blocking up the other side,

757
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:17,089
how do you balance [that]?

758
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:21,890
If you are an excessive thinker, if you’re thinking all the time,

759
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,640
and this causes a block on the opposite side,

760
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,490
how are you balance things out?

761
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,379
Just by, you see, turning your hand left to the right.

762
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,619
It's very simple.

763
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,320
You won’t believe, but that’s how we manage it.

764
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,797
First the vibrations must flow from your hand,

765
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:48,600
then you will know how to balance.

766
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,840
But when that doesn’t happen,

767
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,580
then you can ask somebody to balance you.

768
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,449
It’s quite a big question.

769
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:41,025
He says, You appear to be forming a hypothesis about Kundalini

770
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:45,419
and relating it to medical conditions.

771
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,309
From where does this hypothesis come?

772
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,180
- Hypothesis?
- About Kundalini.

773
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,849
Is My own knowledge.

774
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,445
I have also done medicine, to relate it to that.

775
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,170
Is My own knowledge, I should say,

776
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,770
and so many saints had this knowledge too.

777
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,890
But the only thing I have done is I have related

778
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,279
to not only to medical, but also to science.

779
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,040
That’s very important. Apart from that,

780
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,529
I have devised a method, I would say,

781
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,398
of permutations and combinations of human problems.

782
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,050
I’ve studied them and worked it out in such a way

783
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,400
that en masse Realization can be given.

784
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:34,400
You see, I always try not to talk about Myself

785
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:38,129
because, you see, Christ said that He was the Son of God

786
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:42,550
which was the truth, truth, absolute truth,

787
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,939
but people crucified Him for that.

788
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,060
Because people don’t understand divine things,

789
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,049
they don’t understand, you see;

790
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,410
they have no idea as to the divine Power,

791
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,893
what it can do.

792
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:55,770
So they don’t understand,

793
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,330
so no use telling them about yourself.

794
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,170
As I told you, that I want to live,

795
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,956
I don’t want to get crucified just now.

796
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,717
So when you are meditating

797
00:51:29,918 --> 00:51:31,889
and you feel a force within you blooming,

798
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,759
could You explain what this force is?

799
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,090
- When you are meditating?
- Yes.

800
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,874
Now which meditation she is doing, first of all, let’s know.

801
00:51:41,074 --> 00:51:44,293
- What kind of meditation are you doing?

802
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:46,119
Chanting meditation.

803
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,200
Chanting?

804
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:53,220
Chanting is absolutely wrong. Absolutely wrong.

805
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:56,500
Because if you are not connected,

806
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,729
supposing you are taking the name of God, any way,

807
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,679
and you are not connected,

808
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,580
then what’s the use of taking the name?

809
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,919
You are not connected. It’s like telephoning without connection.

810
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,704
It’s very practical.

811
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:16,440
Moreover, say, if you have to meet,

812
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,050
say, the Queen of England,

813
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,139
you have to have a protocol.

814
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,420
You have to know her, you have to go by proper channel.

815
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,457
You cannot just go and say, “Oh, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth”.

816
00:52:26,658 --> 00:52:28,379
They’ll all arrest you there.

817
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,159
And if you do chanting, then you get into troubles,

818
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,139
terrible trouble.

819
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,410
So you must have authority.

820
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,249
God is not in your pocket,

821
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,460
that you go on chanting His name all the time.

822
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:42,615
But what you have to do is to

823
00:52:42,816 --> 00:52:45,000
be in His Kingdom;

824
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,849
then even once if you take His name,

825
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,625
you are blessed.

826
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:57,450
Chanting is the most maddening thing, I think.

827
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:07,002
There are a number of teachers, such as You say;

828
00:53:08,065 --> 00:53:13,875
they arrived to connect people to Divinity.

829
00:53:14,076 --> 00:53:16,825
On [unclear] born this divine time,

830
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:19,678
what, how and what that relationship is

831
00:53:19,885 --> 00:53:23,868
between the teacher and those who do receive the connection?

832
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:26,809
And whether it can be

833
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,036
whether it needs to be just one teacher

834
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:32,045
or whether a number of teachers to be?

835
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:35,969
Just stand before the light, I can't see.

836
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,490
There is a number, he says there are a number of teachers

837
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,200
who can make this connection for one with the Divinity.

838
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,340
I have not known any, so far.

839
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,090
I have not known any.

840
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,760
They are all in the market and making money, that’s all.

841
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,465
I would like to know if there’s somebody else.

842
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,405
But once you get your Realization,

843
00:53:57,606 --> 00:54:00,079
once you become a Sahaja Yogi,

844
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,009
then you can give Realization to others. That’s different.

845
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,000
But I have not known anyone so far who is doing this.

846
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,398
If you know anyone, please let me know.

847
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:16,310
What you see God as a [change]?

848
00:54:17,303 --> 00:54:18,403
Please translate.

849
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:22,935
How do you see God, how do you describe God?

850
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,920
Should I describe Him just now?

851
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,548
It is, we should say that

852
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:35,826
God is the one who is

853
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,650
the Divinity, we can call it Divinity.

854
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,920
And the Divinity becomes active.

855
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,935
It sleeps, and then it becomes active.

856
00:54:48,135 --> 00:54:50,279
When it becomes active,

857
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,969
then we say that God is now awakened.

858
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,443
And when it is awakened,

859
00:54:57,644 --> 00:55:01,935
He separates Himself from His Power;

860
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:05,500
and His Power is the Primordial Mother

861
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,969
as we call Her, or the Holy Ghost.

862
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,680
And He is watching the work of the Holy Ghost.

863
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,169
She creates everything,

864
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,760
She creates up to human beings,

865
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,800
and it is He who is watching it. He is the spectator.

866
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,369
There are many things can be said,

867
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,100
because you see, God cannot be described in such a short time.

868
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,280
But once you get your Realization

869
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,450
you start understanding what is God Almighty

870
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,025
and what is His Power.

871
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:40,260
But first you must have the light.

872
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,769
As I told you yesterday, now there are so many lights in this hall.

873
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,520
Now if I start telling you

874
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,430
about the origin of this light and electricity

875
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,539
and how it came here and all that, it’s a headache.

876
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,330
But what you have to do

877
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,689
is to just put on one switch and it comes up.

878
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:00,900
When you have the light, in that light if you see,

879
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,139
this subtle knowledge will be easily understood.

880
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,090
I am surprised that these people,

881
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,289
who have never heard a name of Kundalini

882
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,279
and who had no idea of Divinity also much,

883
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,884
have become such experts in this knowledge, in such a short time,

884
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:19,420
while it’s a very, very subtle knowledge.

885
00:56:19,971 --> 00:56:23,089
So gradually you will know everything.

886
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,143
First you get your Realization.

887
00:56:27,323 --> 00:56:28,999
Now, again.

888
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,810
I just wanted to respond to what You said.

889
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:37,644
The response we have among people is very similar

890
00:56:37,845 --> 00:56:39,570
to what You say, in terms of

891
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,980
“I don’t know of anybody else who is able to…”

892
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,539
- Really? That’s all right.
So what it is?

893
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,126
Yes, I really, I must tell you that they,

894
00:56:48,356 --> 00:56:51,745
I think these people understood there’s a market,

895
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:55,969
because, you see, this is a special category of people you are.

896
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,520
It's a special category, it's already described

897
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,359
as such a special category of people who will seek God

898
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,279
- they are called as “men of God” by William Blake -

899
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,951
will be on this Earth

900
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:11,550
and they will know God,

901
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,220
also they will make others men of God.

902
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:18,054
This is described. So many of them have prophesized like that.

903
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:22,180
But when they came to know about that such a thing exists,

904
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,820
they just started a market.

905
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:34,646
I'm still confused. I have a connection with someone in India,

906
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:38,570
by name [Shri Shritagu Balak Brahmachari]

907
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:39,886
What is he saying?

908
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:41,879
and he responds in a similar way.

909
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,860
He has a connection with somebody in India

910
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,320
who speaks in a similar way

911
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,253
about these things to Yourself.

912
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:53,860
He's confused as to who are the genuine and who are the...

913
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:58,068
You see, the genuineness is first to apply one thing,

914
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:00,171
does he take money, first?

915
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:02,939
Ninety-nine percent they’ll finished.

916
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:07,240
Then you should say, does he give Realization to his disciples?

917
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,020
You talk to the disciples. Have they got their Realization?

918
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,929
Have they got any knowledge?

919
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,280
They know the modus operandi or not?

920
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,574
If they do not know, just

921
00:58:16,775 --> 00:58:19,170
they said, “Now, you are realized”, that’s not.

922
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,830
They have to know each and everything.

923
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:22,959
What is their depth of knowledge?

924
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,189
First, as you go in the market, you see, find out

925
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,219
so if somebody has purchased something, is it good,

926
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,020
is really good, or not?

927
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,320
In the same way when you are seeking something,

928
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,249
you must first really with a free mind

929
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,709
go and see the disciples, what have they got,

930
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:42,639
what have they achieved,

931
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,878
how are they, what sort of a life they are leading?

932
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:50,120
It’s the best way if you want to really find out,

933
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,999
it’s the best way to do that.

934
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,059
You should not just blindly go to something,

935
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,039
and you should not just succumb to something

936
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,428
because somebody says so.

937
00:59:00,629 --> 00:59:02,570
Even I, whatever I have said it,

938
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:04,770
I said that you first experience.

939
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,720
If you have the experience,

940
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,820
then only you have to believe in yourself

941
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,460
and you believe in Sahaja Yoga.

942
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,940
Not before that. It’s a blindness.

943
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:17,450
But you can't have the experience unless you have the connection.

944
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:18,736
- What’s he saying?

945
00:59:18,937 --> 00:59:21,200
That's  what we are here for tonight to give you that thing.

946
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,452
Of course, now I am going to do it.

947
00:59:23,653 --> 00:59:25,515
Just go on saying. Do you remember what people said?

948
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:26,870
Please say that I would like to finish,

949
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:29,723
- What’s he saying?
and just give me the experience.

950
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:32,556
- Can I answer that Shri Mataji?
- Yes.

951
00:59:32,757 --> 00:59:35,320
- That is exactly what we will give you.

952
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,881
You see, Shri Mataji will give you that experience

953
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:41,289
and then you can make connections [to upon].

954
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,849
You are making the connections through that experience.

955
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,538
- All right.
- That's not something

956
00:59:46,738 --> 00:59:48,394
that you have to believe or something you will favour...

957
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:49,680
No, no, no.

958
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,439
No, no, no. Not at all it’s not thing like that.

959
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,650
You have to certify yourself.

960
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,180
Now the experience is

961
00:59:56,381 --> 00:59:57,859
that you feel the cool breeze

962
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:01,109
coming out of your fontanel bone area

963
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,009
yourself.

964
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:07,250
And also you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost all around you.

965
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,175
This is to be certified by you only.

966
01:00:11,376 --> 01:00:14,170
But you should not also doubt yourself.

967
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,880
Even so many feel, they'll say,

968
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,090
“This is due to this air-conditioning.”

969
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,499
Then they go home, close the windows, close the doors,

970
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,009
make it hermetically sealed. Still they feel.

971
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,703
Then they say, “Now what is this?”

972
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,680
So doubting up to a point is sensible,

973
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,471
but if you go beyond that

974
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:35,147
then it’s harmful to you, not to anyone.

975
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:38,894
Because I don’t need Sahaja Yoga, you need it.

976
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,119
You need it.

977
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,570
You want it, you have to ask for it.

978
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,740
I cannot force on you. No, no, no way I can force you.

979
01:00:51,054 --> 01:00:53,969
You have to say “I want my Self-Realization.”

980
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,921
In your freedom you have to ask,

981
01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:59,540
otherwise I cannot force. It cannot be forced.

982
01:01:00,488 --> 01:01:04,090
Now one more question and then we will start the...

983
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,467
See person [started].

984
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:12,760
I'm sorry.

985
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:17,538
Can healing capacity is aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

986
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:19,712
So is usual...

987
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:24,180
Is the healing capacity of Sahaja Yoga

988
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,180
aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

989
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,070
What medicine?

990
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,899
Is the ability of Sahaja Yoga to heal

991
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,839
in any way connected with ayurvedic medicine?

992
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,930
Of course. There are two doctors

993
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,449
who have got their M.D. in Delhi,

994
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:44,890
in Sahaja Yoga.

995
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:47,756
They have shown how certain diseases are cured.

996
01:01:47,957 --> 01:01:50,679
They have taken three, four diseases, each person;

997
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,288
Now there’s third one who’s doing.

998
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:54,442
And there are seven doctors in London

999
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:56,319
who are doing experiments.

1000
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,440
I mean, they are just trying to document it.

1001
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,300
Those people have been cured.

1002
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,490
There are people, like blood cancers, nephritis, myelitis,

1003
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,849
all kinds of people have been cured,

1004
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,290
So they are trying to document it.

1005
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:13,129
We have two hundred no, how many?

1006
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,999
Four hundred doctors in Russia

1007
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,139
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga.

1008
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:20,340
It’s all related to it.

1009
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,420
Because this is a new science, we can call it,

1010
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,409
this is Meta-modernism,

1011
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,739
when people are seeing something higher.

1012
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,290
It is working out.

1013
01:02:33,777 --> 01:02:34,880
But that doesn’t mean

1014
01:02:35,081 --> 01:02:36,943
that we’ll take away all the practice of doctors.

1015
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:38,781
They should not be afraid of it.

1016
01:02:38,981 --> 01:02:41,619
Because, you see,

1017
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,099
we can only help people who get Realization,

1018
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,730
not the people who do not get Realization.

1019
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,379
Those people who do not get Realization, we cannot help them.

1020
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,980
So it is a by-product of your Realization.

1021
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,450
Reincarnation, Shri Mataji. What are Your thoughts he's asking.

1022
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,720
Reincarnation. What are Your thoughts on reincarnation?

1023
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:19,040
You do reincarnate, no doubt, you do.

1024
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,200
But you should not believe whatever I say.

1025
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:23,158
Why should you believe that?

1026
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,449
Because I am saying that? You should find out yourself.

1027
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,460
You can find out in Sahaja Yoga

1028
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:31,530
whatever I say is true or not.

1029
01:03:34,452 --> 01:03:36,490
Whatever I say

1030
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,680
is for you to judge later on.

1031
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:45,840
It’s all absolutely open.

1032
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,573
The biggest thing that Sahaja Yoga has achieved, I feel,

1033
01:03:56,774 --> 01:03:58,559
more than medical,

1034
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,320
is that they are absolutely free of addictions.

1035
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,439
People who came to Me

1036
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:14,669
were so addicted to such horrible type of drugs,

1037
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,639
that when they came they couldn’t see Me even.

1038
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,760
They were like coma patients.

1039
01:04:19,961 --> 01:04:22,299
And overnight they gave it up.

1040
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,700
This is the biggest achievement today, I think.

1041
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,599
And I feel very gratified for that,

1042
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,580
because you must have heard how even small children

1043
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,650
below twelve years of age in England,

1044
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,365
in one part of England, in the southern part,

1045
01:04:40,565 --> 01:04:41,960
are taking drugs,

1046
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:44,930
which is such a dangerous thing.

1047
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:54,379
Because you become absolutely free,

1048
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,610
and capable of asserting your freedom.

1049
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,900
Should we now have our Self-Realization, all of us?

1050
01:05:22,925 --> 01:05:25,482
Before we start,

1051
01:05:25,682 --> 01:05:30,760
I have to request you to take out your shoes,

1052
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,300
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

1053
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:51,991
Not working?

1054
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:54,460
All right.

1055
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:57,239
Now, it's all right.

1056
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,070
Connections, you see, that’s the point!

1057
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,340
Now there are two conditions

1058
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,045
which you have to accept.

1059
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:17,966
First one is that at this moment you forget the past.

1060
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:20,966
Absolutely,

1061
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,401
you should know that

1062
01:06:25,655 --> 01:06:29,599
you have no business to condemn yourself,

1063
01:06:31,851 --> 01:06:36,803
that you are not guilty at all of anything.

1064
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,099
If you feel guilty,

1065
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,890
then it’s another myth.

1066
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,329
And at this time

1067
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:50,819
you have to know this All-pervading Power

1068
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:53,559
is the ocean of forgiveness,

1069
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,800
and you cannot commit any mistakes

1070
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,259
which cannot be completely dissolved by this Power.

1071
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:03,011
So have confidence in yourself, please.

1072
01:07:03,212 --> 01:07:05,600
These are very important conditions.

1073
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:07,580
Yesterday I met all of you,

1074
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,593
but today I may not be able to meet you all.

1075
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,890
At least those whom I’ve met yesterday must have noticed that

1076
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:19,579
I had to really correct them on these two points.

1077
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:23,120
So please help Me, cooperate.

1078
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:30,009
Then secondly, the second condition is very simple,

1079
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:32,999
if you understand

1080
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:40,412
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

1081
01:07:40,613 --> 01:07:44,332
Because logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

1082
01:07:44,533 --> 01:07:47,497
you don’t do anything. Logically, think about it.

1083
01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:49,517
You don’t do anything,

1084
01:07:49,718 --> 01:07:52,879
whether we forgive or we don’t forgive.

1085
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,668
But if we don’t forgive,

1086
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:58,517
then we play into wrong hands.

1087
01:07:58,718 --> 01:08:02,450
The people who have tortured us or troubled us or hurt us

1088
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,771
are quite happy, but we are the ones,

1089
01:08:04,972 --> 01:08:08,349
by not forgiving are suffering.

1090
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:10,204
Now some people say it’s very difficult,

1091
01:08:10,405 --> 01:08:12,119
but it is just a myth,

1092
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,820
it’s just a bubble in your head.

1093
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,410
So just forgive all of them, once for all.

1094
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:20,060
I told yesterday those people who were not forgiving,

1095
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,520
they got their Realization,

1096
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,450
“Tell all the flowers, all the trees and everyone loudly,

1097
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:26,280
".

1098
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,760
Don’t think about them also individually.

1099
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,093
Just say “All of them I have forgiven, in general”.

1100
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,000
It’s such a relief. Immediately you’ll feel the relief on your head.

1101
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,480
It’s very important to forgive.

1102
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,080
And that you must have full confidence

1103
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:50,023
that you are all human beings, and you all are capable

1104
01:08:50,224 --> 01:08:52,800
of getting Self-Realization.

1105
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,419
And “I will get my Realization”,

1106
01:08:56,634 --> 01:09:00,086
that should be your

1107
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:06,665
full self-confidence. That is going to help us.

1108
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,420
Now as I have told you, that there’s left and right, two energies.

1109
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:17,899
The left is the energy of mundane desires,

1110
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,340
everyday desires, not the pure desire.

1111
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,780
And the right is the energy of action.

1112
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:28,279
So you please put both your feet

1113
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,960
little apart from each other, who are sitting on the chairs.

1114
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,397
Who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right.

1115
01:09:34,598 --> 01:09:36,579
They don’t have to worry.

1116
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:41,180
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

1117
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,520
This is symbolic

1118
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,340
that you really want your Self-Realization.

1119
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,600
Those who do not want to have, I cannot force it on them

1120
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,780
and they should

1121
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:57,699
in all civility leave the hall,

1122
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,769
because they can disturb others’ ascent.

1123
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:03,916
So to be civil to others, they should leave the hall.

1124
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,960
But those who want to have their Self-Realization

1125
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,572
have to do this much, is

1126
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,378
to do what I’m telling you;

1127
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:19,752
and hardly ten minutes will take

1128
01:10:19,953 --> 01:10:22,439
to have your Self-Realization.

1129
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,500
So just left hand towards Me,

1130
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:26,428
the right hand is to be used

1131
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:30,629
for nourishing your different centers.

1132
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:35,344
So you put first your right hand on your heart.

1133
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:44,110
This is the center of the Spirit.

1134
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,339
The Spirit resides in your heart,

1135
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:51,942
but its seat is here; but it resides in your heart.

1136
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,309
It resides in your heart.

1137
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:58,580
Then you take down your right hand

1138
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,640
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

1139
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,839
This is the center of your mastery,

1140
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,882
which has been created by great masters and prophets.

1141
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,044
Then you take down your right hand

1142
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:18,140
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

1143
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,438
This is the center of pure knowledge,

1144
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:25,319
absolute knowledge;

1145
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,520
knowledge about the divine powers,

1146
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,490
its laws, which work through your being.

1147
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:33,290
You don’t have to know mentally,

1148
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,719
but they are manifested through your being

1149
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,539
pure knowledge.

1150
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,903
As you can see Me,

1151
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:43,299
as you can feel something,

1152
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,500
in the same way, this pure knowledge works through you.

1153
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,005
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

1154
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,754
Then again on your heart.

1155
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,677
Then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, as I told you,

1156
01:12:04,878 --> 01:12:07,640
that when you feel guilty this center goes out of order,

1157
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,220
and turn your head to your right, completely.

1158
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,299
Here is the center where

1159
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,010
you have to forgive yourself completely,

1160
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,410
and to know that you are not guilty at all.

1161
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,119
Now take your right hand on your forehand across,

1162
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:36,080
like this, and gently put down your head as far as possible,

1163
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,640
resting on your hand.

1164
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,570
This is the center

1165
01:12:41,771 --> 01:12:45,945
where you have to forgive everyone in general.

1166
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,617
Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head,

1167
01:12:52,817 --> 01:12:54,195
back side of your head,

1168
01:12:54,396 --> 01:12:57,369
and push back your head as far as possible.

1169
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:01,007
Push it back as far as possible.

1170
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,000
This is the center where, without feeling guilty,

1171
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,380
without counting your mistakes

1172
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:15,412
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

1173
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,860
Now stretch your palm. I’m just telling you how to do it;

1174
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,250
then later on we’ll do it in a proper way.

1175
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,069
Now stretch your palm fully,

1176
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:29,476
and put the center of your palm

1177
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:32,479
exactly on the fontanel bone area,

1178
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,900
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

1179
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,760
Now please put down your head as far as possible,

1180
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:42,866
please put it down,

1181
01:13:43,067 --> 01:13:49,009
and now start moving your scalp.

1182
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,970
Push back your fingers, otherwise there’s no proper pressure.

1183
01:13:52,171 --> 01:13:54,360
Please push back your fingers nicely.

1184
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,379
Now move your scalp with that pressure

1185
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,849
not the hand so much as the scalp

1186
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:02,280
seven times, clockwise.

1187
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,739
Put down your head please, push back your fingers,

1188
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,680
and move your scalp slowly seven times.

1189
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,186
Very slowly,

1190
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:21,670
with a proper pressure.

1191
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:39,207
Done. That’s all we have to do.

1192
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,890
Now I will request you to take out your spectacles

1193
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:45,379
because you have to close your eyes,

1194
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,380
and till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

1195
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:55,548
Move your legs apart from each other,

1196
01:14:55,749 --> 01:15:01,519
and please put your left hand towards Me

1197
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,419
and right hand on your heart,

1198
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:08,320
and now, if there is anything

1199
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,115
that is tight on your neck or on your waist,

1200
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:17,087
please reduce the pressure, be comfortable,

1201
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:21,674
sit straight, not too much bending or bending back

1202
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:25,710
but in a comfortable way, in a very comfortable way.

1203
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:30,632
Now, you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

1204
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,929
Now, please put your right hand on your heart.

1205
01:15:55,606 --> 01:15:57,461
Here you have to ask Me

1206
01:15:57,662 --> 01:16:00,930
a very fundamental question about yourself,

1207
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:04,960
because I told you, you have to become a divine computer.

1208
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,620
So first you use Me for that.

1209
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,690
Now ask a question, in your heart -

1210
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:14,810
you can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother” whatever you like -

1211
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:17,210
ask a question three times,

1212
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:20,850
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask sincerely.

1213
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:24,701
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask three times.

1214
01:16:44,957 --> 01:16:47,615
Now,

1215
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,130
if you are the Spirit,

1216
01:16:56,330 --> 01:16:57,880
you are your master,

1217
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,487
because in that light you know,

1218
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:04,079
what is right, what is wrong,

1219
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,320
and you become your own guide.

1220
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:07,900
So now put your right hand

1221
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,730
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

1222
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,673
We are only working on the left-hand side.

1223
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:16,719
Press it hard. And here

1224
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,362
you ask another question three times,

1225
01:17:20,593 --> 01:17:25,420
“Mother, am I my own master?”

1226
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,969
Ask this question three times,

1227
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:32,780
“Mother, am I my own master?”

1228
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,819
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

1229
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:45,829
I cannot force pure knowledge upon you.

1230
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,839
So now please put your right hand

1231
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,879
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

1232
01:17:53,140 --> 01:18:00,233
Here you have to ask, three times,

1233
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,858
six times, because this petal,

1234
01:18:04,058 --> 01:18:07,249
this, this center has got six petals.

1235
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:10,610
Please ask six times,

1236
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:17,640
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

1237
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,610
Please say that six times,

1238
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:22,960
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

1239
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,579
Say it in humility; you are asking for the highest.

1240
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,680
Six times, please.

1241
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:55,159
When you ask for pure knowledge

1242
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,079
your Kundalini starts rising.

1243
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,170
So we have to clear our upper centers

1244
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:05,469
with our self-confidence.

1245
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,000
So raise your right hand

1246
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,880
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side,

1247
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,170
and here you press it hard

1248
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:17,999
and say with full confidence ten times, ten times,

1249
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,780
“Mother, I am my own master”.

1250
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:25,089
“Mother, I am my own master”.

1251
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:27,090
Please say.

1252
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:32,400
Ten times.

1253
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,410
As I told you

1254
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:52,200
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego,

1255
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,429
these conditionings,

1256
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:59,837
but you are the pure Spirit.

1257
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:06,220
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

1258
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:11,880
Here now, say with full confidence, twelve times,

1259
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:15,500
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

1260
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,420
Please say it twelve times,

1261
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,899
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

1262
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,356
Please put your hand on your heart.

1263
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,559
This divine Power,

1264
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,769
is the ocean of knowledge,

1265
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:39,368
is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss;

1266
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:43,800
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

1267
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,680
and you can not commit any mistakes

1268
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,584
which cannot be dissolved

1269
01:20:49,785 --> 01:20:54,189
by this great power of forgiveness.

1270
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,739
So please forgive yourself,

1271
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:02,210
and put your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

1272
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:04,969
and turn your head to your right.

1273
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,564
Here, please help Me,

1274
01:21:07,765 --> 01:21:10,080
by saying with full confidence,

1275
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,155
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

1276
01:21:14,356 --> 01:21:18,582
Just say that, with full confidence, please.

1277
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:34,381
You have to say that, please,

1278
01:21:34,582 --> 01:21:37,256
sixteen times.

1279
01:21:42,207 --> 01:21:44,259
I have already told you

1280
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,545
that if you forgive or don’t forgive,

1281
01:21:48,746 --> 01:21:52,314
you do not do anything. It’s a myth,

1282
01:21:52,515 --> 01:21:53,697
absolute myth.

1283
01:21:53,898 --> 01:21:55,849
But if you don’t forgive,

1284
01:21:56,050 --> 01:22:00,819
then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

1285
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,103
So give up this myth, once for all,

1286
01:22:03,304 --> 01:22:05,560
just give up this myth!

1287
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,662
Now raise your right hand

1288
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:11,986
onto your forehead across,

1289
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:16,531
and put down your head as far as possible.

1290
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:23,130
Now, here, you have to say, not how many times but with

1291
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,279
your heart in it.

1292
01:22:27,494 --> 01:22:29,759
Say it,

1293
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:36,179
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general.”

1294
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,750
Just say that,

1295
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:44,170
from your heart.

1296
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:08,709
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head,

1297
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:13,200
and push back your head as far as possible.

1298
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,990
Here,

1299
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:23,300
without feeling guilty,

1300
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,160
without counting your mistakes,

1301
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,340
just for your satisfaction,

1302
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:30,109
you have to say

1303
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,820
from your heart, not how many times,

1304
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,310
“Oh divine Power,

1305
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:39,918
if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,

1306
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:42,040
please forgive me”.

1307
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,420
Say it from your heart,

1308
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,070
“Oh divine Power,

1309
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:51,086
if I have done anything, against you or any mistakes,

1310
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,379
please forgive me”.

1311
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:57,000
That’s all you have to say, from your heart.

1312
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:01,850
Stretch back your head, fully.

1313
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:13,400
Now, stretch your hand fully.

1314
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:36,280
And put the center of your palm

1315
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,449
on top of your fontanel bone area,

1316
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:46,212
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

1317
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:03,221
Now, bend your head as far as possible.

1318
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:08,054
Now, push back your fingers,

1319
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:11,690
to have a good pressure on your scalp.

1320
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:15,769
Here again, I cannot force

1321
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:20,009
Self-Realization on you, I cannot force.

1322
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:23,549
So you have to ask for it.

1323
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:28,510
Now move your scalp slowly, seven times,

1324
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:32,139
saying seven times,

1325
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:35,840
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”,

1326
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:38,290
saying seven times,

1327
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:42,570
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”.

1328
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,655
Please open your eyes, slowly.

1329
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,933
Put down your hands.

1330
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:44,170
Now please put both your hands towards Me, like this.

1331
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:52,999
Put your right hand towards Me, like this,

1332
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,129
and now put down your head,

1333
01:26:56,330 --> 01:27:00,249
and see if you are getting yourself

1334
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:05,392
a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

1335
01:27:05,593 --> 01:27:07,976
Just see for yourself.

1336
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:13,130
Now don’t put the hand on top of your head, but away from it.

1337
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:16,640
And sometimes you might get it much further.

1338
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,250
You can also move your hand to see

1339
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,859
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

1340
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,120
Now don’t doubt about the air-conditioner,

1341
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,643
because it’s coming out of your head.

1342
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,572
Now,

1343
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,300
put your left hand towards Me,

1344
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,179
and put down your head.

1345
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:49,800
And now see with your right hand, right hand,

1346
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,360
if you are getting a cool or a hot breeze

1347
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,431
out of your fontanel bone area.

1348
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:05,600
Now, again put your right hand towards Me,

1349
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,710
right hand like this.

1350
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:09,948
Put down your head.

1351
01:28:10,178 --> 01:28:13,009
See for last time, see clearly,

1352
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:17,059
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

1353
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,481
may be slight, might be more coming.

1354
01:28:19,681 --> 01:28:21,439
Don’t get confused.

1355
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:24,891
See for yourself, your attention.

1356
01:28:25,097 --> 01:28:27,406
It’s coming out.

1357
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,059
Now put both the hands towards Me like this,

1358
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,600
and watch Me without thinking.

1359
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,334
You will see that there’s no thought in your mind.

1360
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,569
Now raise both your hands

1361
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:48,544
towards the sky like this,

1362
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,540
and ask another fundamental question,

1363
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,354
“Mother, is this the...

1364
01:28:56,561 --> 01:29:00,171
Mother is this the breeze,

1365
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:06,760
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1366
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,800
"Mother,

1367
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:16,689
is this the All-pervading Power of divine love?

1368
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,220
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

1369
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:22,580
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

1370
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:25,169
Put back your head completely.

1371
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:28,140
Push back your head completely,

1372
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,020
and ask this question, anyone of them, three times.

1373
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,356
Now take down your hands.

1374
01:29:37,556 --> 01:29:40,293
Such flowing of vibrations!

1375
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:50,910
All those who have felt cool breeze on your fingertips,

1376
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,009
in your hands,

1377
01:29:53,209 --> 01:29:58,789
or on top of your fontanel bone area,

1378
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,621
please raise both your hands.

1379
01:30:00,822 --> 01:30:03,463
Please raise both your hands.

1380
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,480
May God bless you all.

1381
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,020
May God bless you all.

1382
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,149
Now you should know, it has not happened

1383
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:20,280
through any mental activity.

1384
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:22,980
So you cannot argue it out, you cannot discuss it,

1385
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,480
but you have to just feel it and grow into it.

1386
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:28,349
Another thing I would suggest that

1387
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:32,260
it’s not an individual procedure,

1388
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,400
it’s a collective procedure, it’s a collective thing.

1389
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,120
Like one nail, which falls out of your body,

1390
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,249
it’s not looked after. In the same way,

1391
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:44,200
if you say that “I am doing it at home, Mother, it’s all right”,

1392
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,309
that’s not the thing. You have to come to our collective.

1393
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:51,590
And we have a very nice collective arrangements here

1394
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:53,212
where you can come,

1395
01:30:53,413 --> 01:30:55,429
and you can tell your problems,

1396
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:57,620
and you can master this art,

1397
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,240
absolutely master.

1398
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,390
I hope next year I’ll come to Melbourne

1399
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,720
and I’ll find lots of people

1400
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:07,170
who have achieved this mastery.

1401
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:09,440
I bless you all from My heart.

1402
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:11,840
Those who have not felt cool breeze

1403
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,280
can come on this side.

1404
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:15,480
So I may not be able to meet all of you,

1405
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,460
though I wanted very much to meet all of you today again,

1406
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:22,770
but we’ll have some music for you to enjoy. Please!

1407
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:28,010
Just....

1408
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:35,291
Sit down. Yes.

1409
01:31:35,503 --> 01:31:37,670
Make a... We have a special announcement to make.

1410
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:40,331
So please, please.

1411
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:50,302
She wants what?

1412
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:52,506
I will follow.

1413
01:31:52,706 --> 01:31:54,203
Water, all right, please come.

1414
01:31:54,404 --> 01:31:57,221
Give her some. Is there any other glass?

1415
01:31:58,011 --> 01:32:01,749
Some other glass. Just put some other glass, please.

1416
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:08,390
It’s difficult for Me.  It’s all right for a child.

1417
01:32:34,568 --> 01:32:37,095
So, yes, how are you?

1418
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:40,699
Mother, they came for Sahaja Yoga in July,

1419
01:32:40,899 --> 01:32:42,967
- They are here.
- Who?

1420
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:46,131
There is one with wheelchair and the one behind.

1421
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:48,417
- She's all right?
- Yes, she's there.

1422
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,343
- Ah, She is the one?
- The young, the young one there.

1423
01:32:51,544 --> 01:32:54,340
- Yes, really! What trouble they had?

1424
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,160
That one was paralyzed.

1425
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,070
Now she can move left hand and the [right foot]...

1426
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:04,563
Amjad! Amjad! Doctor Amjad Ali, please come along.

1427
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:07,762
Are you here?

1428
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,896
We will just talk to them,

1429
01:33:10,096 --> 01:33:11,739
and he has to take their,

1430
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,717
they must be having their medical reports.

1431
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:16,628
No, they haven't, because they live,

1432
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:20,435
that one, she lives in nursing house where is no doctor.

1433
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:23,508
They look after [unclear]. We do [unclear] and send to you

1434
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:25,153
- before nursing her.
- Yes.

1435
01:33:25,354 --> 01:33:27,620
Here, they haven't, but everybody can see it.

1436
01:33:27,821 --> 01:33:30,689
She is still in chair but she can move the left leg.

1437
01:33:30,890 --> 01:33:33,970
So I think I’ll ask Amjad to file it,

1438
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:38,020
because we have to send certain documents

1439
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,776
of people being cured here.

1440
01:33:39,976 --> 01:33:41,600
Yes, I'll take down.

1441
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:45,292
Yes, but I’ll tell Doctor Amjad to help you.

1442
01:33:45,499 --> 01:33:48,175
But I go to bring Nirmala.

1443
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:50,229
I go to bring her here?

1444
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:53,567
Not necessary, it’s all right.

1445
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,326
Somebody is outside who is hurt,

1446
01:34:08,527 --> 01:34:11,476
and the doctor is helping him at the moment.

1447
01:34:11,676 --> 01:34:13,763
- Hurt what?
- [unclear]

1448
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:14,964
How?

1449
01:34:15,165 --> 01:34:16,872
Like walking through the door and he had some glasses...

1450
01:34:17,073 --> 01:34:19,189
and wearing the glasses and they [stepped] on that.

1451
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,400
Bring them here, I’ll cure.
