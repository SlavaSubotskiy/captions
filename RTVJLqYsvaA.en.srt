1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,790
I could not accommodate all of you in my house 
then I thought better to come here all of

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,040
you would fit here!

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,440
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis 
(before Mother’s trip to India).

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,940
We have to understand certain very, very important 
things about ourselves and our organisation

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,340
that is Divine.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:42,660
Now, in broad lines I can tell you, not individual 
problems and individual things because you

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,340
are no more individuals now.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,690
You have become part and parcel of the Divine 
Being and you are awakened cells and so in

9
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,760
a broad way we must understand what we have 
to do about it.

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:19,460
First thing we have to know [is] that we are 
Realised-souls, and that you have got Realisation

11
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:30,119
and that you are saints; that you have all 
the powers that a saint could have.

12
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,079
No saint ever had more powers than you have, 
as it is, which is manifesting.

13
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,609
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

14
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:51,399
You’ll be amazed – none of the books which 
have been written so far have been able to

15
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:59,950
tell you about the spiritual being that is 
within you as you have come to know through

16
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,310
Sahaja Yoga.

17
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,700
One has to accept it.

18
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,729
It is so.

19
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:16,020
Any one of them, whosoever has written any 
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,860
he could not explain so many things which 
you know.

21
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:29,890
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very 
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

22
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,120
or Buddha.

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,460
The quality is very high because they are 
extremely pure people – purity.

24
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,400
They have achieved individual salvation of 
a very high degree.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,170
While you have achieved your collective salvation 
better.

26
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,310
But individually they are of a very, very 
high quality.

27
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,400
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power, 
they had no doubts about God.

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,840
They never had any doubts and they were very 
dignified.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,950
And they never bothered as to their petty 
problems of life.

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,420
For them this was too petty to think about.

31
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,450
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much 
time over it.

32
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:30,390
I know we had to do it because, after all, 
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

33
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:40,950
Yoga with our human awareness and then we 
got our Realisation.

34
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,450
So the purification time is very, very short.

35
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,300
And while they had such a lot of time to purify 
themselves.

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:56,810
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation, 
a very pure form of a personality or, you

37
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,250
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely 
purest form of incarnation.

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:14,020
But they are there to be our ideals while 
what we have done is to become, from human

39
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,430
beings, a prophet.

40
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:24,039
So you understand both the things very well, 
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

41
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:32,810
are their problems, how they get away from 
reality, how they are deluded.

42
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,810
But still we do not use our vibratory power 
as we should use.

43
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:45,090
And this is the point I want to tell you – that 
you all have vibratory powers.

44
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:54,210
When we start using our vibratory powers also 
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

45
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,840
have for using this power.

46
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:07,539
It is the power of the Deities within us and 
it’s a ritual by which we get their power

47
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,529
working in us.

48
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:19,590
As you know that people of ancient times did 
lot of miracles through this power but they

49
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,960
were very dignified people.

50
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:32,570
There was no frivolousness in their character 
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

51
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,689
of no spiritual value.

52
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:40,430
When you use your vibratory awareness you 
should not use them for useless powers like,

53
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,999
for example, going to a cinema and there’s 
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

54
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,819
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach 
that place.

55
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,710
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

56
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,400
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether 
you go to a cinema or not.

57
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,210
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, 
how far you have come in your spirituality.

58
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,680
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

59
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,249
You are a saint, and what saintliness you 
are achieving within you is the main problem.

60
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:18,100
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that 
you have, has no meaning.

61
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,879
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

62
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:30,529
So all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that 
you are now newly born and you are people

63
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,990
of new awareness and you have to have that 
dignity.

64
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,030
I’ll just give an example because I was 
discussing with someone today.

65
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,469
When you give somebody a sort of a bandhan 
you just turn your hand like this or like

66
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,469
that.

67
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,930
This is not the way it should be done.

68
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,779
Your hands itself are to be respected because 
these are the hands of a saint.

69
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:55,569
And all the deities reside on your hands and 
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

70
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,139
or anything, you have to use them properly.

71
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,699
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified 
to do it.

72
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:12,270
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be 
absolutely avoided.

73
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:20,599
Then dealing with each other you have to know 
that you are all now in the circulation of

74
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:21,599
Divine Power.

75
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,710
You have to respect each other and really 
love each other.

76
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,330
You must respect because you are all saints.

77
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,580
Every saint must respect another saint.

78
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,389
That’s the minimum of minimum.

79
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:40,120
And if you do not respect each other, your 
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

80
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,810
because it’s the collective thing.

81
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:48,039
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because 
your sense of security is your collectivity.

82
00:07:48,039 --> 00:08:00,229
And the love between each other has to be 
not only looked after but is to be nourished

83
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,960
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,389
You should not treat each other as human beings 
treat each other.

85
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,389
No!

86
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,300
It’s a precious thing.

87
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,339
And even while talking to anyone very close 
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

88
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:24,080
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise, 
it has no meaning.

89
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,219
You must respect your parents much more than 
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

90
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,940
Yogis, because they are saints and they are 
your parents.

91
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,430
Respect is the keynote of relationship with 
each other to begin with.

92
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,210
And respect without love has no meaning.

93
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,630
Respect and love for each other.

94
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,630
Whether somebody is highly placed in life, 
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

95
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,600
Yoga it does not matter.

96
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,820
How much you earn, what is your position in 
life, where you live is not important.

97
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,140
The main important thing is that we are one 
and we are the people who have become now

98
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,570
prophets and we are the ones who have got 
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

99
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,530
and such a power has come into us because 
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

100
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,690
duty that we should love each other.

101
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,500
And how I respect you?

102
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,200
I need not because you know that there’s 
a big gap between you and me.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
But I respect you because you are saints.

104
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,900
And where the saints are not respected that 
country goes to dogs.

105
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,390
So first of all you must learn how to respect 
each other.

106
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,900
And that is a very, very important training 
we should have.

107
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,940
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether 
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

108
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,970
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

109
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,260
But I do not know how you will react to this 
one that immediately you start thinking about

110
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,560
people who do not respect you.

111
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,430
Think how many people you do not respect.

112
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,560
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that 
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

113
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,890
man does not respect me!

114
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,890
That man does not respect!”

115
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,610
But just think how many people you have not 
respected yourself.

116
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:35,210
When I am not here, I am here much more.

117
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,560
I have not been to Australia, and you know 
how tremendously these people have come up

118
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,060
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

119
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,170
But that has not happened so much here because 
I had to work, really labour here.

120
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,490
Not that England is that bad.

121
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,910
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is 
around.

122
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,029
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She 
can solve them.

123
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,060
” Even small, small problems you bring to 
me – it’s all right – but now you are

124
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,810
capable of solving your problems as well as 
solving the problems of others.

125
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,910
Unless it is something fundamental you need 
not bother about me and you need not also

126
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,910
ask me about it.

127
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,280
You can go ahead with it.

128
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:24,940
But you must think everything in the terms 
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

129
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,260
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

130
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,070
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

131
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,870
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

132
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,520
And fundamentally we have to understand one 
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

133
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,950
let others grow with our growth.

134
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,930
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

135
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,810
You’ll only grow if you make others grow 
with you.

136
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,640
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

137
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:59,930
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes 
into the brains of the people.

138
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,530
It has to go into the heart.

139
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,500
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the 
heart; that is the Spirit.

140
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,990
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

141
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,760
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

142
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,810
Some people, I am told, are using their hands 
like a weapon and all that.

143
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,780
This is very dangerous!

144
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,720
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

145
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,310
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

146
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,930
So don’t try such things.

147
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,720
Some people have a habit of also hitting a 
person with the hand like that.

148
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,070
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

149
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,450
But otherwise you should not.

150
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,680
You have to respect.

151
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:57,390
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything 
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

152
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,780
Of course, you are hitting the negativity 
in another person, I know that.

153
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,990
But you have no business to do that or to 
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

154
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
thing.

155
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,720
You will go down very much.

156
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,120
This is a serious thing one must understand.

157
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,540
You have all the powers you know how far to 
go.

158
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,310
You must keep to your maryadas.

159
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,920
Don’t go beyond, because these things give 
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

160
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,390
which we face always.

161
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,570
Try to improve your language.

162
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,130
Be gentle.

163
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,840
Be very gentle with each other.

164
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,650
I expect that you’ll have many more people 
by the time I come.

165
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,240
I expect fantastic things from you.

166
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,170
I don’t know if I should but I have given 
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

167
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,690
It is unbelievable.

168
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:05,860
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you 
are specially selected and I have worked with

169
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,410
you for years together.

170
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,720
You have got the tapes in English.

171
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,800
French people, poor things, they don’t have 
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

172
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,130
They haven’t got a book in French and they 
have big problems of understanding me.

173
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:27,360
But how dedicated they were, how deep they 
are.

174
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,280
Each one of them came and said, “Mother, 
I love You very much.

175
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I love You.

176
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,860
” “I have many defects and I offer myself 
to You.

177
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,900
Will you accept me?”

178
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,600
All of them said this way.

179
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Just imagine!

180
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,330
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying 
all these things to me and the way they were

181
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,700
understanding their defects within themselves.

182
00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:02,290
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour 
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

183
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,980
and all these things.

184
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,430
For example, say, one is married – marriages 
should be successful.

185
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,450
If your marriage is not successful and happy, 
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

186
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,180
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

187
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,310
That’s very important.

188
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,150
Marriage is the institution established by 
Adi Shakti.

189
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,550
You cannot dishonour it.

190
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,620
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

191
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:42,570
Then you must also allow the children to be 
born to you so that you get great souls coming

192
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:51,720
down on this earth by which we are giving 
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

193
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,930
a very happy life.

194
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,700
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and 
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

195
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,750
a trouble with you and they do not prosper 
well and they have problems.

196
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,730
So, first of all, create a family of happiness 
and joy.

197
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,790
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja 
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

198
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,790
life.

199
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,610
It’s absolutely wrong!

200
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,070
Absolutely wrong!

201
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,529
If you cannot make a happy married life in 
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

202
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,580
First try in the ashram.

203
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,870
[It’s] worth trying.

204
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,940
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

205
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,040
Because then you understand how you share 
your life with others and your married life.

206
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,990
Any such thing like any material thing, like 
getting a house or getting this thing, that

207
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,930
thing is not so important.

208
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,760
Your house should be clean within yourself, 
your temple of your heart.

209
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,710
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate 
money.

210
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,810
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

211
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,710
The real temples which are growing, which 
are the living temples of living God within

212
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,710
us.

213
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:05,440
So these material things are important up 
to a point, not more than that.

214
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:11,270
Most important is not how you are substantiated 
by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated

215
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,180
Sahaja Yog through you.

216
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,780
Many people think, “We should get a good 
house because we have come to Mataji.

217
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
” Yes, you do get.

218
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
You get good jobs.

219
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,780
All right.

220
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
You get it.

221
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
You get your financial conditions improved.

222
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
All right.

223
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
Everything happens to you.

224
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,250
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yog?

225
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,850
In the way [that] – how much have you substantiated?

226
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,930
People think sometimes that if they donate 
money that’s sufficient.

227
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,930
It’s not.

228
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:42,740
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, 
with your friendship, with your sweet understanding

229
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,700
of each other, enjoyment of each other’s 
company in the purest form, not with any purpose

230
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,370
or with any intention of getting any low type 
of joy or low type of happiness from someone

231
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,820
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

232
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,370
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

233
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,940
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

234
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,010
We have to try to be purer and purer.

235
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:18,740
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on 
your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole

236
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,730
being as you would be.

237
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,500
Your presence itself will show that you are 
Sahaja Yogis.

238
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,700
You won’t have to certify.

239
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,240
You won’t have to wear some special dresses 
to say, but people will know from your faces

240
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,180
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

241
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,430
You have to stand back in the last queue.

242
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,680
You should be the people who should look at 
things.

243
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,740
You should not be the first, [that] you need 
to get into the thing first, to getting into

244
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,350
the queue first.

245
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,350
No!

246
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,450
You are the last because you are with yourself.

247
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,040
They are not.

248
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,930
They have not [got] their own securities.

249
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,610
They are trying to find securities in these 
things.

250
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,450
You have your own securities.

251
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:09,820
Change, according to the Spirit, all your 
priorities, and then joy is your own.

252
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:16,520
I really expect fantastic things from you 
and I hope you all will join together and

253
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,660
work it out and create something fantastic.

254
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,790
I don’t know how to tell individually about 
things but as it is I have already spoken

255
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,309
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have 
told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

256
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,309
thing.

257
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,309
And it’s very speedy.

258
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:38,560
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep 
with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

259
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
thrown out.

260
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,360
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,830
Those who cannot keep by some method or other, 
or [who] get locked up by something or some

262
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,180
misidentification, will drop out.

263
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,280
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the 
speed of Sahaja Yoga.

264
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,600
It is going to be tremendous in India.

265
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,980
I know these five years are going to be tremendous 
in Australia.

266
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,430
England may be, depending on your people putting 
up the speed.

267
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,190
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and 
you have to understand that – drop out all

268
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:17,240
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications, 
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

269
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,120
that you are British, this, that, all this.

270
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,480
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal 
beings.

271
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
It’s very important.

272
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,420
The time has come now.

273
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,260
From next year it will start.

274
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,570
So I wish you a very Happy New Year and a 
very, very happy and cheerful Christmas.

275
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,170
May God bless you!

276
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,091
Now we have to await for other people who 
will be coming now but [if] any Sahaja Yogis

277
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:46,810
have any problems or any questions should 
ask now till other programme will start.

278
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,530
Can you have some chair nearby to talk to 
them?

279
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:54,440
I think a simple one will do, it’s too elaborate 
to more.

280
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,050
Douglas wants to move the whole big thing?

281
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,530
Just an ordinary chair, Douglas, is alright 
for me.

282
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,510
He wants to move the big one.

283
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,970
Ask me questions, very important, on to small, 
small things.

284
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,030
Later on, “Mother said so,” or, “Mother 
said so,” should not be there.

285
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,410
Sahaja Yogis should ask because new people 
who have come, who have not got yet Realisation

286
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:17,150
should wait for a while because I am just 
dealing with the Sahaja Yogis.

287
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,470
And then we’ll start our programme after 
just, say, ten minutes.

288
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,850
Is it all right for new people?

289
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,530
Just put it (the chair) here.

290
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,120
Douglas Fry: Should we bring it further forward?

291
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,990
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

292
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,710
I am alright.

293
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,570
Just bring it nearer here.

294
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,240
Now, I want Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions.

295
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,280
It is important.

296
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,340
Sahaja yogis should ask me questions.

297
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Please.

298
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,630
You have to do everything with consultation 
with each other.

299
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,320
No group should be formed separately.

300
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,410
Ask me questions.

301
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,140
Come along!

302
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,690
What’s the matter?

303
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,620
Don.

304
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,890
You’re getting thoughtless.

305
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:32,540
Then, “Mother said like this,” and “Mother 
says like this,” and “Mother has told.

306
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
.

307
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
” – this should be stopped.

308
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,970
You see, actually we think outside going, 
outside doing is the way.

309
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,290
No!

310
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,610
Inside!

311
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,250
Grow inside.

312
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,010
Certain things I am going to write it down 
so that there’s no confusion about things

313
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:59,660
but, till I come back, the ashram system should 
go as it is today.

314
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,300
Then when I come back we’ll change it.

315
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,970
But just now it’s all right as it is.

316
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,290
Nobody should take new steps.

317
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,290
If you get a house or something, all right, 
you take a house.

318
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:16,140
But better thing is to stick on to ashram 
for the time being, look after it and substantiate.

319
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,220
I mean [if] somebody is allotting you a house, 
it’s all right.

320
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,880
But you need not take a house on rent or something 
to get out of ashram.

321
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
That’s the escape.

322
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Ray Harris: I often find that it’s better 
to – after telling them the basics of Sahaja

323
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,650
Yoga – to wait for them to tell you.

324
00:23:36,650 --> 00:24:01,280
And in what they say and their vibrations, 
what is it that they want to know, rather

325
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
than really telling them everything.

326
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Shri Mataji: No, no.

327
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
You should be very discreet.

328
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,960
As I have told you in one of My lectures that 
there are three groups of Sahaja Yogis.

329
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,620
One are the people who are in the inner circle.

330
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,960
Most of you are here.

331
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,720
You need not tell them many things.

332
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,080
Everything need not be told.

333
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,580
That is being not dishonest but that you are 
discreet.

334
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
I mean, you need not tell everything.

335
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,309
That’s a wrong thing.

336
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:37,360
Discretion is to be used.

337
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:45,809
Then the second type are the people who are 
Sahaja Yogis but yet not there.

338
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:50,300
Still [who] are doubting and still are not 
so developed.

339
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,880
Their Kundalini is not up there.

340
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,080
They are still [a] funny type.

341
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,720
These are the people you have to be careful 
about.

342
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,000
You need not tell them everything because 
they can’t bear the Truth.

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,450
They are not yet ready.

344
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,970
Unless and until the Kundalini has reached 
a certain stage they cannot bear it.

345
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:18,790
The sooner you start doing that, the worse 
they will become.

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:24,890
Their doubts will be more because this is 
too much for them to bear.

347
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,990
So you have to wait, wait and see for yourself.

348
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,250
That should not be done.

349
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,480
Just talk about Sahaja Yoga, direct.

350
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,860
You need not talk about me.

351
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,210
Now how will they understand me?

352
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,910
I mean, you cannot understand me, how can 
they understand?

353
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:47,760
The other day somebody asked me that, “Kundalini 
rises with such difficulties, and they had

354
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,450
to purify yourself and all that, and here 
how my Kundalini has risen like this.

355
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,450
Mother?

356
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,450
How could it be?”

357
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:55,450
I said, “It has risen or not?”

358
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,450
He said, “Yes.

359
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,450
” “You feel it?”

360
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,450
“Yes, yes, I have.

361
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,450
It is risen.

362
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,450
” Then I said, “There must be something 
with me.

363
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,450
All right?”

364
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,410
He said, “That’s what I was wondering 
that must be something about Mother.

365
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,330
How is it that She’s done it?”

366
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,700
I said, “There is something.

367
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,700
All right.

368
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,500
So just now you need not find out.

369
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,990
Just now you find out about yourself.

370
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,990
Let it grow.

371
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,990
Because I do not want to shock you.

372
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,550
There is something about me, no doubt.

373
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,550
”

374
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,640
And one of them was saying that, “It’s 
such a miraculous thing that my sinus has

375
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,240
gone, I am feeling so much better.

376
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,360
My drugs I have given up.

377
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,620
I’m so much better and so fantastic that 
I can’t believe it.

378
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,760
How can it be?

379
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,070
I tried all kinds of medicines, I went to 
the hospital, I did this, I did that, I had

380
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,070
an operation.

381
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,070
Nothing worked out.

382
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,900
And how is it this simple thing like Sahaja 
Yoga has worked out?”

383
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,080
I said, “It is too simple but it is to the 
point.

384
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
It’s so precise.

385
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
It acts.

386
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
It is something that acts.

387
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,970
” “But how is it?”

388
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,970
I said, “It does!”

389
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,470
Like we were going to Paris.

390
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:01,250
They announced that the temperature of Paris 
is zero degrees.

391
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,350
So, Christine was sitting next to me rather 
worried.

392
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,020
I said, “Don’t you worry!

393
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,340
It is going to improve.

394
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,320
” Within fifteen days they said, “Suddenly 
the temperature has gone up five degrees!”

395
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,440
Today London’s temperature has gone up after 
my coming here.

396
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,559
It works but they are surprised how it is 
working.

397
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,700
After all, all these things are promised.

398
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
The time has come.

399
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,820
But you need not tell them!

400
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
No, don’t shock.

401
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
It’s correct, Ray, what you say.

402
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
It’s very discreet.

403
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
Ray is a very discreet person.

404
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,850
No doubt about it.

405
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,220
He has tremendous discretion.

406
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,370
And that’s what you should use: What to 
say to anyone and how far to say.

407
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,770
It’s a very discreet method.

408
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,130
And you must know how to compromise also.

409
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,090
You should not be something like a cynic.

410
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,070
You must learn to compromise.

411
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,960
You must learn to compromise.

412
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,350
And understand [that] they are people who 
are not yet Realised.

413
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,679
You are Realised, you are grown into it, you 
are much more matured.

414
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,880
So you have to be much more gentle with them 
and not to show off to them [that] they feel

415
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
small.

416
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,890
Like somebody is asking a question, maybe 
stupid, may be, possibly.

417
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,880
Doesn’t matter, he’s not Realised.

418
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,570
And if you laugh at him sarcastically or make 
fun of him, naturally you lose him.

419
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,000
You are not to lose these people.

420
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,780
You have to get them in, and that is their 
right, they are seekers.

421
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
They are seekers.

422
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,860
We have to really understand this with great 
compassion and love for them.

423
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
They are seekers.

424
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,600
We have to work it on them, not to just laugh 
at them or make fun of them or in any way

425
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,740
to put them down.

426
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,799
On the contrary, show them due respect because 
they are seekers as you were.

427
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,112
Before that what we were?

428
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:45,470
What sort of people we were?

429
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,190
How many arguments we have had with Mother?

430
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,470
How stupid we have been?

431
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,640
We just forget all that and suddenly we become 
very wise.

432
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
No!

433
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,540
Wisdom lies in understanding that they have 
to have their enlightenment.

434
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,240
They haven’t got it as yet.

435
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,130
They have to grow in that light.

436
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,370
This is the problem.

437
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,000
Now you have to use your discretion.

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,040
There’s no need to ask me.

439
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,110
I will know from your mistakes, where you 
have done mistakes.

440
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,070
But consult each other, consult each other.

441
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,090
Talk to each other absolutely freely.

442
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,950
There’s nothing to be hidden amongst Sahaja 
Yogis.

443
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,030
Nothing to be hidden among Sahaja Yogis.

444
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,260
But with elders, with other people, be respectful.

445
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,800
Maybe you being young are more active in Sahaja 
Yoga.

446
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,630
Maybe children are still not so developed 
in it.

447
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:40,190
We have to take all of them together, not 
to be unkind by any kind of sarcasm because

448
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,429
I have told you a hundred times and hundred 
and eight times now: sarcasm has no place

449
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:46,580
in Sahaja Yoga.

450
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,870
This is no way of joking!

451
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,790
It’s a very sly method.

452
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,679
Nobody should beat also, in the same way.

453
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,510
It’s just the same, other side of the coin.

454
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,830
Beating or shouting or putting up your head 
like this on other people, like this.

455
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,660
Many people have a habit of putting their 
heads like this when they talk to others.

456
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,570
Or French people have a very bad habit of 
putting their face like this.

457
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,570
I was surprised.

458
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:18,030
Anybody you talk to … means nothing goes 
into his head.

459
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,480
I said, “What’s happening here?”

460
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,559
Is he like a duck?

461
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,559
And you say anything, again they will say 
another thing.

462
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,190
I mean, everything has a tail coming out.

463
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,200
So is that these are our tails?

464
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,780
We should understand that.

465
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:41,049
We should not put up ourselves to such barriers 
but accept things as they are.

466
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,900
And those who have, who come to you, don’t 
get angry with them because by talking or

467
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,669
argument you are not going to convince them 
but by only by Sahaja Yoga.

468
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:50,980
Try to give them Realisation.

469
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,100
Do not argue!

470
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,760
Some people think, “If you talk to them 
sweetly, if you are sympathetic.

471
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
” No!

472
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Also that doesn’t work out.

473
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,059
You go on wasting your time with them, and 
they’ll go away.

474
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,110
They’ll not be there.

475
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,160
Where is their Kundalini?

476
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,470
How far is it rising?

477
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,450
That’s the point you should see.

478
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,929
Instead of just trying to be very nice to 
them, then discussion, then this.

479
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:09,929
No use!

480
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:10,929
Waste of time.

481
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:16,370
In the same way if you are angry with that 
person and argue; it’s also wrong.

482
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,150
Both are a waste of time.

483
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,900
But be gentle and kind and see where is the 
Kundalini.

484
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,660
Best is to use photographs.

485
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,049
And please do not start curing people.

486
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:31,300
Otherwise, I’ll find all the sick patients 
in Sahaja Yoga.

487
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,160
They are not to cure.

488
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
It’s finished now.

489
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
Better not do it.

490
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
What’s the use of curing these people?

491
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
They are so ungrateful.

492
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,080
They have no sense at all and they don’t 
want to do Sahaja Yoga.

493
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,490
We are not interested in such useless people.

494
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,600
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga will improve 
in their health automatically.

495
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,610
You don’t have to give them any treatment.

496
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,540
They can work it out on the photograph, that’s 
all.

497
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:06,483
That’s the end of it.

498
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:07,483
Sit down!

499
00:32:07,483 --> 00:32:08,483
Now, what any other?

500
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:09,483
Maureen?

501
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:10,483
Mark [Rossi], ask some sensible questions.

502
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,500
You are good.

503
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,200
They have been a very good husband and wife, 
I must say.

504
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,860
Very happy with them.

505
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,240
They are a good, ideal couple and I hope they 
keep it up.

506
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:31,010
Also there are some people I know who are 
very much interested in getting everyone married.

507
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,010
Now stop it!

508
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,160
Till I come back you don’t have all these 
things.

509
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,470
Otherwise the mind, it becomes a marriage 
bureau.

510
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,900
Some people have a specialty about it.

511
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,580
Instead of loving others’ children, also 
create your own children.

512
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,140
Some people like to play with others’ children.

513
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,590
It’s also not good.

514
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,570
Better have your own children.

515
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,110
That doesn’t mean you just love your own 
children.

516
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,870
But that’s how they get that thing satisfied 
and they don’t want to have children and

517
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,550
then who’s going to bear the children who 
want to come on this earth?

518
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,190
That’s a big responsibility.

519
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,510
What else?

520
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,810
Ask one or two questions.

521
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,110
Gavin, please ask some questions.

522
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,750
It’s two minutes more.

523
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:26,660
Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga 
from becoming a cult?

524
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,490
Shri Mataji: What is it?

525
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:45,490
Gavin Brown: How do we prevent Sahaja Yoga 
from becoming a cult?

526
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,740
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s possible.

527
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,280
Because, you see, you think, “I’m catching.

528
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
I’m catching.

529
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,520
” This madness has come also in Sahaja Yogis.

530
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,220
This will become really cultish stuff!

531
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,919
It will really become a cult.

532
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:03,919
Nonsense!

533
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:04,919
What are you catching?

534
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,549
You are pure vibrations.

535
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:10,760
You give Realisation to anyone – none of 
your chakras catch anybody else.

536
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,200
Everybody thinks, “I’m pure,” – what 
it is they say?

537
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,320
Holier than holy!

538
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,440
What is catching?

539
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
What?

540
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,099
All such dainty darlings are no good.

541
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,220
“I am catching.

542
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,380
I ! You have to be brave warriors.

543
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,110
What is catching?

544
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:38,310
“I don’t want to give vibrations with 
this catching.

545
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,970
I don’t want to do it.

546
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:40,970
” All right, use the photograph to begin 
with.

547
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,320
But if you have to do it, you should not be 
frightened.

548
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,500
You are swords!

549
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,190
It is true, Gavin, what you said.

550
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,190
It’s very true.

551
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,780
But you look after that part – that none 
of them should become that, “I am catching

552
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,020
this and I am catching that.

553
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,550
” And “I don’t like this and I don’t 
like Sahaja Yogis doing this.

554
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,550
” This is all wrong.

555
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,010
This will make a big cult out of it.

556
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,160
Of course, that’s not possible.

557
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,609
You try such tricks and you will know what 
it means!

558
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:18,330
That won’t be possible though.

559
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,910
But be careful; you will go out of gear.

560
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,700
Nobody has to form a cult.

561
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:31,150
Everybody who is coming to Sahaja Yoga has 
to be absolutely with both the arms stretched

562
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,200
out, “Come along!”

563
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,950
Just like your Mother.

564
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,620
I should be the greatest cult myself.

565
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:43,510
Why should I bother about anybody else?

566
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:50,800
This catching business should drop out from 
your mouth.

567
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Everybody comes and says, “I caught it from 
him.

568
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
” “I caught up from them.

569
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
” I am amazed!

570
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,970
How can you catch up from anyone?

571
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,250
What are you?

572
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,020
A dainty darling or what?

573
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,200
Now no more it is going to be tolerated!

574
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,650
“I caught up from that.

575
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,370
” Go and beat yourself with shoes.

576
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,850
If you are such a dainty darling that’s 
what you deserve!

577
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,700
You know how to do it!

578
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
(laughing)

579
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Nobody should say, “I am catching.

580
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,720
” Also neglect these things completely.

581
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,610
The more your attention you pay them, the 
more they will sit on your head.

582
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,850
Just neglect and go ahead.

583
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:40,660
What Paul has pointed out is true.

584
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,960
This is very common in England, not in India.

585
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
Nobody says that, nobody.

586
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,610
I’ve not heard one person saying, “I am 
catching from that person.

587
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,610
” Never!

588
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:54,249
They say, “This is my weakness so I must 
have felt for that.

589
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,260
” They never say like that.

590
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,750
This is [your] speciality – putting the 
blame on others.

591
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,810
This is typical ego style business.

592
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,400
Put the blame on others!

593
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,480
As if you are pure and you have caught up 
from another.

594
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,770
It’s your weakness.

595
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,040
That’s all what you should think about.

596
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,619
You are brave people.

597
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,880
You have to be very, very brave.

598
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,500
Without bravery how are we going to do Sahaja 
Yoga?

599
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,040
Just tell me.

600
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,490
You have to love with bravery.

601
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,880
In love you don’t think and consider and 
all these things – you just go ahead.

602
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,740
Such a powerful thing to love someone.

603
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:41,200
That “Such person should not be there and 
such person should not do that” – nothing!

604
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Now those people who come for the first time, 
or are not so much – they may not have proper

605
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,250
protocol – that doesn’t mean that you 
get after their heads.

606
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,140
Otherwise, it will become a cult.

607
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,830
The first thing is consideration of others!

608
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,760
And understanding that they are not Realised, 
they are not enlightened.

609
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,420
This is very important.

610
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,980
You must understand this.

611
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,320
They are not enlightened as yet.

612
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,790
They have not got their vibrations.

613
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,790
They haven’t got their vibratory awareness.

614
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:13,320
To get angry with them is wrong, absolutely 
wrong.

615
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,820
What else now?

616
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,150
That’s a good point.

617
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:31,990
One more point you can ask me because some 
people are coming.

618
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,720
Also do not allow your weaknesses to sit on 
your heads.

619
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,830
For example, some people have a habit of telling 
me, “Mother I had this, I was this, I went

620
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,370
there and still that is lingering into me.

621
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,240
” Then you are absolutely useless!

622
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,230
Why don’t you take it out?

623
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,230
Finish off.

624
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,230
Like that.

625
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,970
“Still I have been to this yogi, I’ve 
been to that yogi.

626
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,240
I have done this, I have done that.

627
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
” It’s done!

628
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Finished!

629
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,730
In the present time you are pure Spirit.

630
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,430
Become that.

631
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,420
What is there to be proud of these nonsensical 
things?

632
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,820
They are no parallel to Spirit.

633
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,780
When the Spirit shines the darkness has to 
go away.

634
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,820
If there is still darkness that means something 
wrong with you, and if you are wrong, then

635
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
what are you boasting about?

636
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:26,599
I mean, people have a habit of boasting!

637
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:37,450
Try to be alert and loving; loving and alert.

638
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:42,040
You have to be really alert.

639
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,640
What else?

640
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Yogini: [unclear]

641
00:39:49,240 --> 00:40:05,440
Shri Mataji: It’s a little personal question, 
isn’t it?

642
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:13,350
I’ll tell you separately, all right?

643
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:24,780
Because this is not the problem of many, all 
right?

644
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,920
General problems should be solved.

645
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,500
This is very personal.

646
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,080
It’s pertaining to you.

647
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,880
What else?

648
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:54,020
Man: If I follow you, do I have to give up 
friends who…?

649
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:03,330
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, not at all.

650
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,830
Why should you?

651
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:14,130
On the contrary you’ll want all your friends 
to come and join us.

652
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,250
You don’t follow me; you follow your Self 
only.

653
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:27,650
It’s a question of not giving up but your 
priorities change because your awareness changes.

654
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:41,560
Like I could say that if you take a horse 
through the streets of Paris, he would not

655
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,320
notice anything.

656
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,810
For him any dirty place, filthy place, is 
the same as the any street.

657
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:56,290
If you take a man or a woman, she will notice 
prostitutes standing on the street.

658
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,480
He may be repelled towards them, may not be 
repelled also, possibly.

659
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,610
Mostly he would not be repelled.

660
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:13,420
But if you take a saint or a Sahaja Yogi, 
he’ll have compassion for a prostitute but

661
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,160
he will know that she has to learn herself.

662
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,820
And he won’t go near her.

663
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,470
When she will come to him, he can pardon her 
and look after her.

664
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:31,869
But there is no involvement in her, in no 
way.

665
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:35,060
So the awareness changes.

666
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,300
You start giving up things which are not spontaneous, 
which are not living, which are dead.

667
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,110
You start living a living life.

668
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,369
It automatically works out.

669
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,150
You don’t give-up.

670
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,770
On the contrary you get new friends, lots 
of.

671
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,349
They are all your friends and brothers once 
you get it.

672
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,859
Because the language changes, the style changes.

673
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,430
You have the light; they are dark and black.

674
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,160
They are still in darkness.

675
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,050
So they are fumbling, while you see the things 
straight.

676
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,050
You can help them.

677
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,980
But if they are fumbling and trying pull you 
down, you will say, “No, I can’t come

678
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,980
that way.

679
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,099
Now I’m changed.

680
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,630
” You are changed, and they are not yet 
changed – that’s the point.

681
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,640
It’s transformation, actual, that happens 
within us.

682
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,510
You don’t have to give up, not at all.

683
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:30,400
On the contrary, you must meet other people, 
you must talk to other people.

684
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:40,080
But, for example, if you have other friends 
who are anti-God, you won’t be able to tolerate

685
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,030
their company and they won’t be friends 
anymore.

686
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,080
I will think, “They are not my friends.

687
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,109
They are anti-God.

688
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:52,140
They are anti-love.

689
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,800
” You would not like to waste your time 
with them, having a whisky party or something.

690
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,150
You would not like.

691
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,260
What a waste!

692
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,839
You would not like.

693
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:05,240
But you may be with them but you may not like.

694
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,250
Many people do like that, I have seen.

695
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:14,930
Many people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga 
try to spend their time with other people.

696
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:19,170
Some of them do it because they have to do 
it.

697
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,880
I know, I have a double life myself.

698
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,930
But My life is such that wherever I am, I 
am with myself.

699
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,220
But Sahaja Yogis try to change, I have seen.

700
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:37,690
They spend more time with Sahaja Yogis than 
with other people like brothers, sisters,

701
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,690
cousins.

702
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,430
They start changing that.

703
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:45,490
Either the brothers, sisters, cousins try 
taking more interest in Sahaja Yoga, or they

704
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,770
don’t enjoy their company.

705
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:53,390
It’s just they may go just to visit or to 
see someone but they don’t like their company,

706
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,550
they don’t enjoy their company so much.

707
00:44:55,550 --> 00:45:01,560
It happens like that, because you are enlightened 
people.

708
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,089
Like drunkards: they don’t like non-drinking 
people.

709
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,220
And non-drinking people don’t like drunkards.

710
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,330
If you go with the drunkards, you are frightened.

711
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,589
And mad people like mad people.

712
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:12,720
It’s like that.

713
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,160
So then the company changes.

714
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,740
And if you don’t change, you really don’t 
enjoy Sahaja Yoga really into its fullest

715
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,740
extent.

716
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,220
But there’s no cult as such.

717
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,660
You are saintly people.

718
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,060
You are saints.

719
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,430
So saints talk in different language.

720
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:31,690
Yes, they are much more congenial and happy 
with the saints.

721
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,250
But they would like to meet people and talk 
to them and try to bring them, because we

722
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,450
have to bring such a lot of people to Sahaja 
Yoga.

723
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:47,570
But you should not waste your energies with 
people who do not matter in God’s work.

724
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,859
You don’t feel like.

725
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:54,210
I mean, I don’t say that “You don’t!”If 
you have to go to see somebody, I don’t

726
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,210
say, “You don’t!”

727
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,609
But it happens with some people.

728
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:03,970
And such people can go down because they have 
influences on these people, and it happens

729
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:04,970
like that.

730
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,970
Your priorities change.

731
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,340
You only then start enjoying whatever is God’s 
style.

732
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,380
You don’t like something which is anti-God.

733
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,560
Like I don’t say, “Don’t drink!”

734
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,740
I don’t say Ten Commandments, nothing.

735
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,550
But it happens to you.

736
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:26,100
There were so many people who were drug addicts 
who came to Sahaja Yoga.

737
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,420
They gave up drugs.

738
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,160
Now, how can they be with people who are taking 
drugs?

739
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,100
So they started going to them and talking 
to them and they said, “We have given up

740
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,100
drugs.

741
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,100
” All right?

742
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:42,310
There’s somebody in Paris whose husband 
is drinking such a lot, and he is still a

743
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,310
drug addict, and she is a Sahaja Yogini.

744
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,720
But he comes to My programme, and I told that 
she should be very kind to him and gentle

745
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,750
because he wants to give up.

746
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,920
But a person who is dragging her, “You must 
also take a drug!”

747
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,119
Then you don’t like that aggression.

748
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,100
I mean, you should be allowed to be non-smoking 
also, if you don’t want to smoke.

749
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,550
But they don’t allow!

750
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,380
For them it is difficult.

751
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,570
They’ll force you, “You must drink.

752
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,570
You must smoke!”

753
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:13,264
I mean, you must be knowing this that, if 
you go to any party, and if you don’t drink,

754
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,264
they think you are mad!

755
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,264
And they’ll go on asking, “Why don’t 
you drink?

756
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:16,264
At least take this, at least take this.

757
00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:17,880
” If you tell them even once, “Why do 
you drink?”

758
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
“Oh, you don’t drink?”

759
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
– finished.

760
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,950
Then you are the most anti-social person, 
you have no manners, nothing.

761
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,599
I mean you are telling something nice but 
they’ll go on forcing on you.

762
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,260
You have to go on telling them that, “Oh, 
we don’t drink.

763
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,339
I don’t drink.

764
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:32,339
I don’t like it.

765
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,339
The Doctor has told me.

766
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:35,849
” All sorts of lies you tell them but they’ll 
go on forcing you.

767
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:41,200
But even if you say once that, “Why do you 
drink?” or “Please don’t drink.

768
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
” – finished.

769
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:49,970
You are the worst person in the whole world.

770
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,950
This is such an aggression!

771
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:53,140
Such an aggression.

772
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,690
It’s a very subtle aggression of these people 
who are licentious.

773
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,130
It’s funny sometimes, I tell you.

774
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:09,940
Like we went to a party, and at that party 
there was a funny couple came in – that

775
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:15,520
was a woman who was a keep and this and that, 
and it was a party of married women and married

776
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
men.

777
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,270
And the way the woman was on with everyone, 
I mean, nobody liked it, neither the women

778
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,480
nor the men.

779
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,040
And we didn’t like that the man – why 
should he bring his keep there because it

780
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,180
was not a party of keeps?

781
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,180
But it’s aggression.

782
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,180
And she was so aggressive!

783
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,260
She was saying, “What’s the use of being 
married to a man after all?”

784
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,141
She was just saying all kinds of things against 
us, those who were married women.

785
00:48:37,141 --> 00:48:38,141
“There’s no use marrying men.

786
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:39,141
I am very happy.

787
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:40,141
I am a keep.

788
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:41,141
He looks after me better.

789
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:44,390
You better give up your husband and live as 
a keep with them.

790
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,290
” She was just giving us a lecture on her 
status!

791
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,320
And we could not say anything to her.

792
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,850
But if we say that it’s nice to be a married 
woman and to be virtuous, “Oh, they are

793
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,850
the worst women.

794
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,850
You are victorian!

795
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:58,850
You are old-fashioned hag!” and all sorts 
of things will come on you!

796
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,180
There’s a very big aggression on saints.

797
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,079
They can’t talk.

798
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,619
They can’t say anything.

799
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,730
While even your own brothers and sisters and 
mother and father and children will do that,

800
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:13,130
“Oh, you are very old-fashioned.

801
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,160
It’s nonsense!”

802
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
Like that.

803
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:24,800
It’s not easy to exist with virtue in this 
country especially, and in the Western countries

804
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,480
because now I know what it is.

805
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:40,060
My husband also doesn’t drink so they tell 
him, “Oh, is it your wife who has forced

806
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,420
you not to drink?”

807
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,790
I mean, he said, “She doesn’t say anything 
like that.

808
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,950
Why do you blame Her?”

809
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:48,950
Immediately [they say].

810
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,290
I mean, there’s no shame about it of saying 
such a dirty thing!

811
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,730
I mean, there is shamelessness, complete shamelessness 
about it.

812
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,050
And not only drinking – all sorts of shamelessness 
goes about.

813
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,849
You ask a lady, “Are you married?”

814
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:03,849
“No!

815
00:50:03,849 --> 00:50:05,390
Why should I?

816
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,720
I am not a fool like you!”

817
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,560
It’s a typical answer.

818
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,200
I mean, because you are married you have to 
look like a criminal!

819
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,000
Because you are virtuous you should be crucified 
immediately.

820
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,750
When you change that, with these people, you 
give up, naturally.

821
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:33,990
I mean, you don’t want to meet such people.

822
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,550
And then they might say that you are cultish 
but it doesn’t matter.

823
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,150
I mean, we have to save ourselves.

824
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,700
I mean, we do not want certificates from them!

825
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,099
The certificate has to come from God, not 
from these people.

826
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,651
They are incapable of giving us certificates.

827
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:49,690
That you know very well.

828
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:53,730
So should we start?

829
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,750
Something else?
