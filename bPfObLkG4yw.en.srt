1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:07,930
I bow to all seekers of truth.
These are the special times when so many seekers

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:20,250
are born all over the world. We are not aware
as to the nature of this time, when we get

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,480
so much worried, anxious and upset with so
many things happening around us and we do

4
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:40,250
not find any answer to it. Sometimes if you
read some of the books which give all the

5
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,120
datas about what is expected of human beings
many people have now, I think, accepted the

6
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,790
ultimate doom and they think that after all
the doom has to come so why worry. Even Mohammad

7
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,719
Sahib has talked about the doomsday but much
more than that he has talked about the days

8
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:18,030
of resurrection. They all have talked about
the future, the day of judgement, the day

9
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,180
of resurrection. When is this going to happen
and how it is going to happen? We have to

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,760
first of all know that why are we seekers
and what are we seeking? When I said that

11
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:41,369
you are the seekers of truth we have to find
out first of all what is the truth, and for

12
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,990
that finding out we have to just use some
logic, we have to come to some logical conclusion.

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,360
Now the first thing one must know that we
have become human beings from amoeba stage.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,610
We have come to this stage with a purpose,
it is not purposeless. But why have we become

15
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,610
a human being? There must be some purpose
and if this purpose has to be served it will

16
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,639
be served not by some sort of an outward happening
but something inward has to happen to our

17
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:28,150
awareness. Like animals do not have any awareness
of cleanliness, of beauty, but human beings

18
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,150
have. In the same way when we become a higher
personality we have to have something happening,

19
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,999
happening again I say, to our awareness. And
for this I would say Jung has done lot of

20
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:48,999
work, Jung who opposed Freud very much and
he said that if man has to evolve little higher

21
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:59,129
than what he is he will achieve his own goal
and according to him also the goal of man

22
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:06,719
is to become collectively conscious. So even
the scientists, the psychologists have prepared

23
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:14,419
the stage for our ascent. Even Darwin who
did not believe in God but he did say that,

24
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,730
" If man has come so far he has to go still
further somewhere at his destination." Even

25
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,239
he would not accept a situation or a proposition
in which one has to say that there is no purpose

26
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:38,599
of nature in creating human beings.
The second conclusion we have to come to very

27
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,599
logically, understandingly, is that the process
of evolution has been done by the living force

28
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:52,279
of life. It's not done by something which
is dead. Like supposing we read the book it's

29
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:58,709
all dead work or if we stand on our heads
or do any such things we don't create anything.

30
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:05,709
Living thing can be understood from, living
process can be understood from a living thing.

31
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,900
Like if you have got a seed and it looks like
a dead thing but you put it in the mother

32
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,900
earth then it starts sprouting by itself,
spontaneously. How it happens, why it happens

33
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,930
we can't explain, but it does. You see for
yourself that it happens and that kind of

34
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,930
a living force has worked out your evolution
without your knowledge but now in your knowledge

35
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,419
it has to happen. That's the only difference
between the evolutionary process so far and

36
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:43,889
further, and because it has to be in your
knowledge you are given complete freedom to

37
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:50,199
choose either the ascent or the descent.
And when you come to this right conclusion

38
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,000
that it has to be done through some living
process then you must understand another point

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that you cannot pay for it, not a single pi.
Because this is something very difficult for

40
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,199
human beings to understand that you can get
something without paying but you are getting

41
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,469
something. You get the sun's rays without
paying for it. Everything, this pay business

42
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:19,650
and all, this economic activity has been started
by human beings alone. It's not done by God

43
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,969
and perhaps God never understands money at
all but is all done by human beings and also

44
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:29,979
they want to bring in God into the same pattern
and say that you can sell God. You cannot

45
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,500
organise God and you cannot sell God. So another
conclusion we have to reach that we cannot

46
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,500
purchase God or His Divine Power, this has
to be brought to us spontaneously. Means that

47
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:52,189
we cannot sort of work it out ourselves, it's
some sort of a grace or we can say a force

48
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:58,629
that has to work it and when that grace works
it out we can become a higher personality

49
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:05,629
as we have become higher personality so far.
Now this grace about which people have talked

50
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,819
that there is an all-pervading power everywhere
and this all-pervading power is doing every

51
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:22,129
living work. Like again I say when the living
process where we see a flower becoming a fruit,

52
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,780
thousands and thousands flowers we see are
becoming fruits. How do they become? They

53
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,780
become spontaneously, but how? A flower just
becomes a fruit, we take it for granted. Now

54
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:43,229
the thing is, this all-pervading power is
everywhere, is everywhere, and that pervading

55
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,759
power does this living job everywhere. Not
only that it makes a flower into a fruit but

56
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,759
also it decides which flower has to become
what fruit. It decides, it co-ordinates, it

57
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:09,009
arranges, it organises and it loves. So this
power we have to feel. We never feel it, we

58
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,360
see only nothing but the breeze blowing but
we don't see any power being existing in this

59
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,360
atmosphere. The reason is this power is subtler
for our feelings, we cannot feel it, is the

60
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:32,099
frequency of this power we cannot feel. "So
how are we to feel this power?" is the first

61
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,050
question should come logically into our head.
There must be something more must happen to

62
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,900
us we have to become subtler personality to
feel that power.

63
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Now this becoming is the knowledge of the
roots, is not the knowledge of the tree. Whatever

64
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,639
we have achieved through our mental projections
or all discoveries and everything we have

65
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:02,120
done about nature, is we have put them in
the books and all that is nothing but the

66
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,120
knowledge of the tree. But this tree is sustained
by the roots and these roots are sustaining

67
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,819
this great tree which is growing, but if this
tree doesn't look after its roots a day will

68
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,069
come that it is going to be destroyed. And
that's why people are frightened that this

69
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:28,499
creation is going to be destroyed now, it's
just on the verge of destruction. Even the

70
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:35,499
human beings who are the epitome of great
evolution have done nothing in totality if

71
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:44,940
you see the science has advanced more towards
destruction than towards construction. It

72
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:49,420
has constructed few things, all right, but
in a whole way supposing you construct the

73
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,470
whole house very beautifully, make everything
beautifully and decorate it nicely and then

74
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,089
you put a big bomb underneath it. That's what
we have done out of science. We have created

75
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,779
all these nice things and then we have got
this hydrogen bomb, this bomb, that bomb,

76
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,100
planted on all the sites that if a button
is pressed the whole thing can collapse whatever

77
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,920
we have created with such difficulty. So look
at the stupidity of our endeavour, our enterprise,

78
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,399
the way we have worked it out that in totality
we are just facing our own destruction through

79
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,279
our own mental projection.
So the other thing that has to happen to us

80
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:37,279
in our realization is that we find out a method
by which we understand the constructive side

81
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:44,350
of life. Anything done without the Spirit
in it, without God's grace in it, leads you

82
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:51,350
to destruction. Even the elements can get
upset with such a society and can start destroying

83
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:58,370
such societies but if the elements do not
take over it is only the same societies which

84
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:03,709
are trying to elevate a society to higher
level themselves turn back upon themselves

85
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:10,709
and start destroying it. Because there are
no moorings for us, there are no roots, because

86
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:18,250
this kite which is flying has lost its attachments.
The attachment has to be to the Spirit.

87
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,070
Shri Krishna has said that "Yogakshema (spelling
? sounds like -- na me hum u hum) that you

88
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:31,070
get your 'yoga', means 'union with the Divine'.
Once you get union with the Divine then I

89
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:38,209
look after, "I look after yogashema" means,
"I look after your well-being", is said by

90
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,759
Shri Krishna. But he doesn't say that first
I will look after yogakshema and then you

91
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:48,440
get your yoga it's the other way round, you
have to take to your yoga. Now the right conclusion

92
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,800
about yoga we should find out what is yoga.
Now many people think that doing hatha yoga,

93
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,190
which is just a little bit of standing on
your head business, is yoga. It is not. It

94
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,370
is very commonly said, "I am doing my yoga".
I mean you can't 'do' yoga you have to be

95
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,370
'in' yoga. 'Yoga' means 'union with the Divine'
and this happens to you, it just happens to

96
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,529
you by which you become connected with your
Spirit, what Christ has said is the rebirth,

97
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:24,300
we are to be born again. But human beings
are so much deceptive to themselves, they

98
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,360
deceive themselves so much that I have known
people that when I went to America I told

99
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,110
them that you have to be born again and all
that. After that some of them started an organisation

100
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,920
called as Born Again and they just self-certified
themselves that, "We are born again." But

101
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,120
I mean how can you certify yourself as born
again when you haven't got the qualities,

102
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,220
the capacities and the powers of a twice-born
personality?

103
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:55,220
Now we have to understand also that if it
is going to be a new birth, a transformation

104
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:04,069
must take place within us. We must have a
transformation. But you'll find that all efforts

105
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:09,910
people have put it in of conditioning, giving
puritanical ideas and doing all sorts of things

106
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:16,910
it has not been able to give people transformation.
It has not led to any transformation. On the

107
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,360
contrary, their addictions to all kinds of
habits, addiction to all kinds of thoughts

108
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,089
and also enslavement to all sorts of conditioning
has not at all vanished. In some way or other

109
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,339
if they are communists, they become capitalists,
if they are capitalists they become communist.

110
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:40,540
You see from one to another you are going
into some sort of an ism, ism, ism, ism.

111
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,889
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like this
because you are only human beings, only human

112
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:52,730
beings in the eyes of God. He has created
variety he has created one variety of say,

113
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,850
Australians, then in Australia also he has
created so many varieties as you have so many

114
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:03,850
flowers we have so many human beings. But
inside every flower flows this vital force

115
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:10,980
of God's love and that vital force is to be
understood through going into the roots not

116
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,569
from outside through your mental projection.
Actually through your mental projection how

117
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:23,569
far can you go? Because it's a limited brain
that you are using to understand a problem

118
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:31,190
but you have to go to the unlimited. If it
is so, something has to trigger it, your ascent,

119
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,620
into that space where it is unlimited and
that's why we have to know that through only

120
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:43,149
logical conclusion we can come up to the door
but afterwards you have to enter through this

121
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,500
door through that triggering otherwise you
cannot enter into it.

122
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,269
Now whatever he has told you all about these
chakras you need not believe as Dr Warren

123
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:58,509
has told you. There's no need to believe into
it because even if you have blind faith it's

124
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:05,509
not going to help us. But as a scientist you
must keep your mind open and you must accept

125
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,920
this as a hypothesis placed before you. Now
this hypothesis if it is proved right you

126
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:20,949
have to accept it as a law, the Divine law.
Now this hypothesis is that you have got all

127
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,170
these seven centers within you and you have
got the power called as the Kundalini placed

128
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,790
in the triangular bone.
Now one may say that this is a Sanskrit word

129
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,000
and Sanskrit is not for only Indians it is
for all of us. As English language is for

130
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,589
all of us, in the same way Sanskrit is also
for all of us. But only thing I would say,

131
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:50,300
that as the west was more busy, and you though
you are on the east but still I call it the

132
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,480
west, busy with the advancement outside, there
were people who were busy with the advancement

133
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,480
down. And these people are the seers who have
seen that there is a power which is settled

134
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,350
down in the triangular bone called as sacrum.
Now this is a Greek word. It is very interesting

135
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:16,220
to know that sacrum means sacred. And I asked
the Greeks when I went to Greece I asked them,

136
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,740
"Why do you call it sacrum?" They said that,
"Most of these words have come to us because

137
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:28,740
we have had a very long rapport with the Indo-Aryan
groups." "So when was that?" They said, "It

138
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:36,939
was much before Alexander went to India."
So we knew about India long time back and

139
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:42,160
the Indians told us that this is a sacred
bone. Even doctors know that when the whole

140
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,160
body burns this bone does not burn. It takes
lot of temperature, very high temperature

141
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:55,089
to burn this bone and when you put it in the
cremation this thing and all that, that has

142
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:01,470
to brought to a very high temperature so that
this bone should burn but with other temperatures,

143
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,470
lower temperatures, the whole body may burn
but this bone will remain still unburned.

144
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,829
So the reason is there is this power which
is protecting it.

145
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:18,750
Now this power is called as Kundalini because
it has got three and a half coils within it.

146
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,009
You might have read some of you, being seekers,
you must have read books about Kundalini and

147
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,589
everywhere I go people tell me that, "Mother
we have heard that this is a very dangerous

148
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:33,839
thing to have the Kundalini awakened and it's
very, very wrong to touch it." Now this is

149
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,339
something absurd. First of all this is the
only way you are going to get your realisation.

150
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,560
Is the primule, is the germ within you, the
germinating power within you which is going

151
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,660
to give you the ascent and how can that be
a thing that will be dangerous for you. There

152
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,449
must be something wrong. For example, I don't
understand about this instrument or about

153
00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:01,449
electricity. I'll put my both the fingers
in the plug and I get a shock and I say, "Oh,

154
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,770
it's the most dangerous thing that you can
have," that means I don't know how to handle

155
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,690
it.
But Kundalini when She is said to be troubling

156
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,720
people it is never the Kundalini but this
first centre of innocence which gets into

157
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,790
annoyance and when it gets into annoyance
it sends lot of heat in the body and that

158
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:27,790
heat is felt in the body by so many people.
When people who have no authority from God

159
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,960
Almighty, we can say, those who are not holy
people, those who are making money in the

160
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,540
name of God, those who are people with very
bad characters who have no possibility of

161
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,860
even taking the name of God such people when
they try these tricks it happens to you that

162
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:54,860
you feel that tremendous heat in the body.
One must know that heat is not a sign of spirituality.

163
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,340
Everywhere, whether is in Sanskrit or any
language, they have said that it's a cooling,

164
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,250
it cools you down. Even a person you say,
"He's cool minded", means he's not violent.

165
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:14,250
Now in science if you try to cool down the
helium gas they, you'll find that when it

166
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,610
is not cooled down, it is heated up, all molecules
fight each other. They become so violent that

167
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,540
they hit each other. They form certain groups
hit each other, and then these groups also

168
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:32,060
again hit each other. But when helium gas
is cooled down they all become collective

169
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,180
and they start behaving in a manner that is
very collective.

170
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,160
So the idea is people who say that with Kundalini
you get tremendous heat, you start jumping,

171
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,150
and people told me that they start jumping
like a frog. One gentleman sitting before

172
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,830
me had put both his legs on the ground he
was sitting. So they said, "You can't put

173
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:00,790
these feet towards Mother". So I asked him,
I called him, "What's the problem?" You see,

174
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,840
Indians understand how to respect a saint.
So I said, "What's the problem? Why are you

175
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,790
putting your legs towards me?" He said, "Mother,
if I sit with folded feet I start jumping

176
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,250
like a frog". So I said, "Are you going to
become a frog now? Just think about it! You

177
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,200
are not going to become a frog or a bird.
You are going to become a higher personality.

178
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,210
Who has told you that you are becoming a frog?"
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by a guru

179
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,560
and he has given me this book and in that
book it was written", (actually I saw it with

180
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,930
my own eyes, what a misleading thing!), "that
he is a person who gets his Kundalini awakened

181
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:42,390
starts jumping like a frog."
Now all these absurd things must be understood

182
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:48,780
that all abnormalities are dropped out after
you become the Spirit because that's the most

183
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,780
beautiful thing you have. Spirit is the reflection
of God Almighty and when the Kundalini rises

184
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:04,550
and pierces through your fontanelle bone area
where you actually get your baptism that time

185
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,880
you become a beautiful person, a decent person,
a sweet person, a nice person and you forget

186
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:21,390
all your violence. Not only that but you feel
the love for others and not violence. Your

187
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,180
ego drops out, your superego drops out, means
your conditioning drops out. If these transformations

188
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,170
don't take place what's the serve of becoming
the Spirit? So the ideas people have that

189
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,050
you start jumping.
I know of so many people now who have been

190
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:45,040
to fake gurus. And this point I must bring
to you because everywhere I went the newspaper

191
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,040
people ask me about the fake gurus. The other
day a American lady asked me in an interview

192
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,920
of radio at Perth that, "How do you explain
that the people who are seekers, the young

193
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:07,310
people, they go to India and they end up penniless
and sometimes they get epilepsy or they take

194
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,560
to drugs? Or they become jobless, useless,
they live like cabbages and they have nothing

195
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:22,500
to contribute to the society or to themselves.
How do we explain that?" She says I've got

196
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:29,500
the datas to show you. I said, "I agreed".
I do feel ashamed that these gurus who are

197
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,480
not only fake but they are criminals they
go into another country to make money. I agree.

198
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,250
I accept.
But also I would blame the people who go to

199
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,480
them. They are naïve, simple people. They
are the ones who are earnestly seeking but

200
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,000
you must come to some logical conclusion about
everything. That is important, because you

201
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,130
are here to get to your Spirit and not to
get to a guru. That's one thing one must know

202
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:06,130
that we have to be the Spirit and not be attached
or be sort of enslaved by any guru whatsoever.

203
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,590
The guru resides within you in your heart
and your Spirit is your heart. Only thing

204
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,030
somebody has to trigger it just to become
that. But the amount of enslavement and all

205
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:22,240
these things people undergo for nothing at
all. You cannot pay for it. Anybody who takes

206
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,940
money from you is a parasite, you must know,
whether he may be calling himself anything,

207
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,300
by any name. Don't listen to such a person.
Now I've been telling all the people for the

208
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,100
last fourteen years. I was the one fourteen
years back, in a very big hall, at least five,

209
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,340
six times bigger than this, called as Jehangi
Hall in Bombay, I spoke so loudly about all

210
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,400
of them. I told their names I told them what
they were, how devilish they are. Keep out

211
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,200
from them. But nobody would listen to me.
Even when I went to America, in the beginning,

212
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,880
nobody would listen to me. I told them that,
"Be careful. These fake gurus are out, they

213
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,620
are going to loot you. Be careful about them.!"
But nobody would listen to me on this point

214
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,950
because they were so enamoured.
On the contrary, they were teaching me some

215
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,470
wisdom. "Mother, you must take some money
otherwise Americans won't understand. If,

216
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,420
unless and until they pay for it they are
not going to understand". I said, "How do

217
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,770
you underestimate them?" They said, "It's
true". And I tell you I ended up with some

218
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,520
disciples there or some people who got realisation,
but I was so frustrated. I asked one great

219
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,300
saint of India to go down to New York about
two years back, and he ran away. He ran away.

220
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,150
He said, "I can't manage these Americans.
Their whole thinking is just the other way

221
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,390
round, about God, about everything".
Now there were people who were teaching that

222
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:49,030
you can approach God through sex. I mean absurd
things, it's obtuse, absolutely it is opposite

223
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:56,030
of what God is. Not that in Sahaja Yoga we
disregard sex, sex is a part of life. But

224
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,450
sex does not play any part in the ascent you
can see because the first centre here Mooladhara

225
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:08,450
is for your excretion and for your sex. So
we do not in any way condemn it, but it has

226
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,600
its own sanctity and its own channelising.
If you become sort of perverted about it you

227
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,610
develop diseases, there are problems and anything
that is divine cannot give you a disease.

228
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,920
So another conclusion they should have reached,
I think, that if you are sick, your head is

229
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,230
going, reeling, if you are feeling unhappy,
sickly and you don't know what to do then

230
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,460
why should you stick onto that guru? Because
just you have paid for it? It's like if you

231
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,760
go to a drama and it's boring, you don't like
it but you said, "Now we've paid for it so

232
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,840
go through it". That's all right because drama
doesn't make you mad, you see, but this kind

233
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,870
of thing which is so dangerous even if you
have paid, finish with it. Now we started

234
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,940
that we have had enough of this man. Now they
are buying Rolls Royces, they are buying aeroplanes.

235
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,260
Look at where is their attention. They're
more bothered about gathering money to themselves

236
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,970
and having other people's money as they call
them opium and live on that and thrive on

237
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,510
that and why don't you use your brains to
understand that how can you pay for your realisation?

238
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,540
It's one of your mistakes, I think, not to
understand that anyone who is interested in

239
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:22,540
your purse is not interested in your Spirit.
Then apart from that there are so many other

240
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:29,790
mistakes people have committed in pursuit
of God. One has to know that when you get

241
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,320
your Spirit you get your own powers. I may
say I'm as these people have said that, "She's

242
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,130
the greatest saint". All right. If they have
said it I say, "All right, because all the

243
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,520
saints in India say so about Me, so all right,
I agree". But I need not say that. Even if

244
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,830
I say, "I'm the greatest", why should you
believe in it? What have you got? What powers

245
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,100
have you got out of it? What have you achieved
out of it is the point. Is should be absolutely

246
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,410
clear cut to you that unless and until you
get your realisation you should not (sounds

247
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:07,100
like pujout) and you should not accept Sahaja
Yoga is the ultimate. You must try to get

248
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,940
your realisation, you must get the mastery
over it. Unless and until you have done it

249
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:17,600
what's the use of all Sahaja Yoga done to
you. After all it is to transform you into

250
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,510
a new life. Transform you, what is your own,
is all your own property, I would say. Everything

251
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:30,890
is like a trust. I sometimes say I'm like
a banker. Now you put your money in the bank

252
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:37,120
and I'm just a banker who has to give your
money. I'm little a very gracious banker so

253
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,990
I may give double, four times, five times,
ten times, that's a different point.

254
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,990
But you are seekers so you are 'men of God'
as described by another very great saint of

255
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:56,340
England, William Blake. He says he has described
all these things to us very clearly that at

256
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:03,340
this time men of God will be born and they
will become prophets and they will have powers

257
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,100
to make others prophet. He has said so clear,
everything is so clear-cut, you can't imagine.

258
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,980
If you read him you will be amazed that he
has even mentioned where the ashram for Sahaja

259
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,990
Yoga will be, where I will be staying, into
all details he has mentioned and you must

260
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,740
have heard the story of Jerusalem that England
will become chaste. I mean if you are (inaudible)

261
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,790
what they have been doing about hundred years
back in India nobody could have believed the

262
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:37,790
stories that he said, but he could see that
the same land which is so aggressive today

263
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,470
will become the land of peace, harmony and
of spiritualism.

264
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,380
Australia especially I have tremendous respect
for Australia as a land because it plays a

265
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:56,380
very important role in Sahaja Yoga. This first
centre is the Mooladhara, is Australia. Australia

266
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,960
is the Mooladhara of the whole universe and
I find every Australian when I meet them there's

267
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,100
a kind of an innocence in him which is still
showing now. Of course, innocence can never

268
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,830
be destroyed, it can be covered but it can
never be destroyed. I have seen that in Australians

269
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:20,290
there is a kind of an innocence which shows
very sweetly and that's where it works out

270
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,300
very fast.
Now Dr Warren he first came to me, and his

271
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,790
friend, and in the beginning they were very
volatile people, extremely angry, hot tempered

272
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,650
and all that, you see. And they came to me
when I was on my way to Pune so I said, "All

273
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,690
right, you come along with me, I haven't got
time". I think they came to My house and they

274
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,360
touched their realisation but still they were
so volatile and so angry. So I said, "All

275
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,580
right, you come along with Me to Pune". And
you see in Sahaja Yoga we don't take any money.

276
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,800
Naturally, you see, we haven't got very good
arrangements for you. If you want you can

277
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,520
stay in a hotel, if you want, but as far as
we are concerned whatever Sahaja Yogis had

278
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,520
arranged in those days, so we arranged for
them to stay in a (what was that?) a, some

279
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,310
place, all right, and there there was a doctor
from England and these two persons and there

280
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:14,120
was only one mattress for three of them, you
see. There was troubling, pushing each other.

281
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,020
In the morning, you see, they got up and they
got into the rickshaw, saying, all their luggage

282
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,940
there. I said, "Why?" "We slept on the cement",
you see. I said, "How?" "We slept on the cement",

283
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,540
thrice+. They went on. I said, "What's the
matter?" I said, "How did you sleep on the

284
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,110
cement? They didn't give you any mattress?"
"No, nothing. That fellow from England he

285
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,880
was snatching our mattress all the time and
we could not sleep and we slept on the cement."

286
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,790
And in that I felt the sweetness of it, how
sweetly they were telling Me their problems.

287
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,290
It's such a simple problem to sleep on the
cement but sleeping on the cement helps a

288
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,410
lot, (they did not know at that time), which
helps quite a lot that the Mother Earth sucks

289
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,200
your problems. So it was all arranged perhaps
that they should be on the cement. But the

290
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,380
way they were angry so sweetly and everybody
enjoyed that anger so much in Pune and then

291
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,390
they got their realisation and I knew that
something good has to happen.

292
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:15,120
Once an Australian gets their realisation
it will work out very fast. That's what exactly

293
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,310
what happened in their case and should happen
everywhere. I'm very happy on my tour last

294
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:27,310
time in Sydney we did very well. And then
we had also this time some program at Perth

295
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,860
for the first time. Many people, about three
hundred people, got realisation and it was

296
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:39,860
wonderful and the whole thing worked out in
such a beautiful way that I am so much encouraged

297
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,500
to be here to be with all of you and to do
this job, because this is the job I am here

298
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,500
for. For this you don't have to do anything.
First I have to work and then you have to

299
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,370
work for others. There are so many who are
lost, so many who are seekers all over the

300
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:03,580
world it's not in Australia only, everywhere.
They have taken to drugs out of seeking, they

301
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,320
have taken to these gurus also out of their
seeking, all these problems have come to these

302
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,320
seekers. Even too, I've seen people who were
quite of my age group they told me they have

303
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,350
been to some guru in America and who wanted
to cut their tongues. All sorts of things

304
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,000
they have been trying. You don't have to do
anything like that. You have to be quite intact

305
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,760
but only thing that light within you which
is the Spirit has to shine into your attention.

306
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,660
Tomorrow I'll tell you what is self realisation.
Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what is self

307
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,540
realisation and also I'll tell you about the
chakras. In any case they have given you the

308
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:48,350
books which are of course just the beginning
of the whole thing is, you can see and read

309
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,790
it and understand what are these chakras and
what do they do. There's nothing to be afraid

310
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:59,600
of, nothing to be worried, it's your own,
it has to happen spontaneously, it happens

311
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,790
absolutely without any trouble or torture
to you. It may happen to all of you, it may

312
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:11,790
happen to some of you and whatever it is we
have come here for this purpose only and I'll

313
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,930
work out till my last breath to see that you
get what you deserve.

314
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,280
May God bless you.
