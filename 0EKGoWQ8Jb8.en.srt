00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:27,649
[Music]

2
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:36,199
do you have a guru and at what stage did

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,059
you receive self-realization and I don't

4
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,360
have a guru lot I want you to have a loo

5
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,100
you better become your own girls

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,530
secondly I've been born like that I

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,839
never got any realization or anything I

8
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,300
just got realization I should say human

9
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:52,339
realization when I understood what was

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,260
the problem with human beings I worked

11
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:56,899
on the old permutations and combinations

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,059
of human beings because I wanted to have

13
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:00,829
an our mass media by which I could give

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,320
realization to thousands of people

15
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:06,729
because any discovery which is made and

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:12,110
it's not brought to that level it is

17
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:15,710
absolutely detrimental to the growth for

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,800
example you see Jesus was crucified why

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:22,820
because he was alone only for his mother

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,440
nobody knew what he was at that time he

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,539
could not achieve this because you all

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:32,030
were not there at that time and also

23
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:33,890
other people you know how the Saints

24
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,039
have suffered and how every prophet has

25
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,280
suffered because they could not create a

26
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:43,459
mass understanding of it so at a certain

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,560
point it has to become a master in the

28
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:49,039
Tree of Life there are only three or

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,140
four flowers in the beginning but when

30
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:54,200
it grows when the Blossom time comes

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:59,330
then so many flowers are there and they

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,190
become the fruits so I I just saw that

33
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,349
this is the time I have to do this job

34
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,020
so you would call it my human

35
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:08,599
realization when I understood human

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,520
beings of course even now sometimes I

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,430
get shocked the way they behave I mean I

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:18,770
just don't understand but I think now I

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:21,560
understand that for those people who

40
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,640
can't quite understand that answer don't

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,830
think about it mother has to be somebody

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,930
special but find out for yourself that's

43
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,590
the best way you don't worry about me

44
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,590
you are

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,390
to yourself I must be someone alright

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:46,099
even if I'm not doesn't matter if you

47
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:46,790
are going to get it why not have it need

48
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,250
to love you

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:57,370
okay let's first learn about Kundalini

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:03:00,709
basic many years ago part of what I

51
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,790
understood was that we please don't

52
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,900
leave me you talked about raising it

53
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,290
spontaneously yeah and what I had

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,410
understood was that you must always have

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,840
a master to help you raise it that

56
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,630
somewhere it isn't safe I mean

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,170
psychologically or emotionally to raise

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,330
it yourself that you need the master you

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,849
should guide you yes so I wanted to ask

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,739
about the phrasing of it but she's

61
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,420
asking me if that she's read that you

62
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,730
have to have a master nor do you have to

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,709
have a master no doubt meaning the

64
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,500
person who is an enlightened soul a

65
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,600
person was a realized soul can only do I

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,730
wish you knew how to do it he would have

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,100
done it himself so you have to have a

68
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,500
master who is called as a sudden the one

69
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,250
who has achieved the truth and who is a

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,400
fast

71
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,549
now I'm not a master thank God I am NOT

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,519
a master at all I am a mother and mother

73
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:58,430
is always a master in a way so that's

74
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,090
what it is but as far as I am concerned

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:06,370
I am too stopped to be a master writing

76
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,980
because I cannot be hard

77
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:30,520
that's what so you have to have a master

78
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:33,190
but to get a master rather or why has

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:38,229
that been over time in history to say

80
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:41,380
Abraham in nurses see first we have to

81
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,030
build up the Father root you see out of

82
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:48,370
fear because without fear

83
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:50,740
human beings won't listen imagine at the

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,450
time of Moses the Ten Commandments that

85
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,610
he brought had to be changed the people

86
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,530
were so for it

87
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,419
he had to make them very very strict at

88
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,700
that time you can see from the books

89
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,289
that he seen so you have got the food

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,550
you get the fool ideas - how terrible

91
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:09,970
the people we're now then we had to talk

92
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:14,080
of Christ because he had to cross the

93
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,300
argument he had to cross it because that

94
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,789
was the problem that time the ego was

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,729
too much she imagined at the time of

96
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:24,190
Romans how they were already - so he had

97
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:26,110
to do that joke now today we have

98
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,599
reached at a point fact doubt absolutely

99
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,180
fed up offer me who super-heroes

100
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:33,819
everything now the only the mother can

101
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,249
help

102
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:38,830
so it has to be at different various

103
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:42,120
levels of your awareness one had to work

104
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:45,699
out now is the time of mother to nourish

105
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,189
his mother to give you that love because

106
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:52,779
you won't be spoiled by anymore that you

107
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:56,580
understand the authority with which

108
00:05:52,779 --> 00:06:00,370
Moses stopped authority with which

109
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:08,979
Socrates stopped authority with which

110
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:20,770
loud say talked all these great are the

111
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:23,469
gurus from Adi not to Sai not they

112
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,849
didn't say if you do this way will be

113
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:38,349
good or that way would be good no this

114
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:40,949
is what it is you better do it this is

115
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:40,949
what these

116
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:57,350
but in modern times those gurus may not

117
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:57,350
work out that's why a mother had to come

118
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:09,450
first to give you realization because

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:13,280
these gurus did not realize another

120
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:18,780
point that their disciples not

121
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:23,280
understand them at all whatever they are

122
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:29,970
doing they are doing out of all but or

123
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:36,240
doesn't have understanding in it or even

124
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:38,400
the earlier ones may have had the

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,970
generation that came afterwards did not

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:48,330
have so they turned the gurus into a

127
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:54,270
facade and the whole building they owned

128
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:58,230
as their own creating all kinds of

129
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:03,030
problems filling the universality and

130
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:13,500
the collectivity because brahma tattwa

131
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:19,400
is the power of the collectivity is in

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:24,660
everything in the atom in the molecule

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:29,010
in the human heart everywhere it is

134
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,850
reflected depending on the reflector and

135
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,850
it controls

136
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:49,060
this understanding they had but the

137
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,850
human understanding perhaps they did not

138
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,130
have that if he today tell them

139
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,709
something they might listen to us but

140
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,540
tomorrow they will forget so it was

141
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:03,580
necessary that you all should be given

142
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:09,610
realization otherwise also without

143
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:12,670
realization what's the use was this of

144
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:17,110
talking to people about the colors those

145
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:20,320
who don't have eyes so realization has

146
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:23,260
to be you so the first and foremost

147
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,589
thing we have to know that this Hodja

148
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:31,270
yoga has worked out because param

149
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:35,140
Chaitanya is transmitting compassion it

150
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,950
never did before never had that kind of

151
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:43,600
an attitude which it is there because I

152
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:45,610
am a mother and this compassion has

153
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,850
worked it this way that you all have got

154
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,770
your realization you have achieved a

155
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:56,890
state which we can call as a

156
00:09:50,770 --> 00:10:01,500
self-realized Souls but still because

157
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:05,579
you got it so easily cheaply I think

158
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:11,010
still we don't realize what we have got

159
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:17,200
still we do not practice meditation

160
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:20,470
introspection and dedication some are

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,140
very much there many people tell me

162
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,470
mother people had to do so much to go to

163
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,959
Himalayas do these do that and then they

164
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,910
got their realization how is it these

165
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,660
people who are blessed even with some

166
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,050
great Saints asked with that what right

167
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:40,600
there to get this realization why did

168
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:44,170
you give this realization what have they

169
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,029
achieved I said only their desire their

170
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,670
desire was very much there that they

171
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:54,750
should get their realization and that's

172
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,750
how they got it but now to go

173
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:03,980
into only desire is not sufficient you

174
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,750
have to depend on yourself on the light

175
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:14,420
of your spirit you should see what's

176
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:21,310
wrong I am supposed to be your guru but

177
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:27,579
I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

178
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:27,579
is very different from mine

179
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:40,089
normally a guru is a very very strict

180
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:40,089
person and has no patience of anything

181
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:52,959
so there are two three types of tests

182
00:11:46,699 --> 00:12:03,050
are all the time taken after disciple

183
00:11:52,959 --> 00:12:08,870
firstly how much they obey but as you

184
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:14,440
all have got realization and you are

185
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:17,440
your own gurus I don't put that

186
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,440
conditionally

187
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:30,080
I leave it to your freedom I tell you

188
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:42,860
our Leslie in all the way possible what

189
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:44,600
I think good for but I don't compel like

190
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,820
these gurus used to do I mean they used

191
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:57,410
to beat they used to hang them on the

192
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:58,850
well they were so very strict with their

193
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:05,209
disciples and I have had an experience

194
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:10,910
of this they never used to smile no

195
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:17,000
question of laughing and would never

196
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:22,010
show any kind of weakness of kindness

197
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,520
for the disciples see a guru has to be a

198
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,709
very angry person wearing only single

199
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:34,370
dress either upwards or downwards I

200
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:40,220
don't know however with a big thick rod

201
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:44,480
in the hand never spoiling laughing no

202
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:48,380
question smiling and the Guru's have to

203
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:58,459
be very long fist developing big big

204
00:13:48,380 --> 00:14:02,810
bears and no ladies allowed in such a

205
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:06,050
situation where the women are not to be

206
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:09,520
seen at all I mean I shouldn't see will

207
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,520
see my face it's like that

208
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:20,990
there is a big discussion in all the

209
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:24,920
scriptures anat scriptures outside the

210
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:31,430
critics whether a woman should be

211
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:34,480
allowed to do the spiritual practices or

212
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,480
not imaginable

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,070
not only among Christians will be

214
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:45,110
surprised even in Indian scriptures

215
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:50,600
whether is women should be allowed or

216
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:55,310
not to do spiritual practices now when

217
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:59,690
your mother is a woman and she is yo

218
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:07,579
guru what will you do this is another

219
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:11,990
confusion because it is wrong the whole

220
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:18,500
thing is falsehood based or no basis at

221
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:26,769
all you may try anything to say that

222
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:26,769
women are not meant for spiritual life

223
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:39,980
try any argument it fails the whole

224
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:43,519
thing has to be brought up this way that

225
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:50,449
everything faces reality all these false

226
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:51,829
ideas have to be given up like if you

227
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,800
have a carpet upside down the whole

228
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:57,380
design is upside down but if you put the

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,899
carpet right everything falls in line

230
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:05,480
and that's why you needed a mother to

231
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:10,459
give you realization and a guru as a

232
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:17,149
mother to teach me that for ascent of

233
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:20,600
God nobody can be provided sahaja yoga

234
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:22,250
is not a military thing it's just

235
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:30,630
playing

236
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:34,500
simple mother slaw and of course every

237
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,870
mother wants her child to be great to

238
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,930
have all her powers she wants her no

239
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:47,959
doubt how she does it

240
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:52,230
how she works it out is her own problem

241
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,490
but how you take it and how you use it

242
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,959
is your own problem

243
00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:00,240
I always bow to you people who have got

244
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,240
realization because I think so many

245
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,890
saints we're never there on this earth

246
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:11,040
but the saintliness has to be complete

247
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:14,760
without that you cannot help even your

248
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:20,970
family leave alone your country and no

249
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:25,770
question of the whole world so what is

250
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:29,340
needed now is to raise your awakening to

251
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:34,490
raise your spirituality to go into a

252
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:38,670
realm of complete support and surrender

253
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:47,980
to the movement of the spontaneous

254
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:55,060
movement of Salva may God bless you
