1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,260
Kundalini.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,710
You see,sickness comes to you,

3
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:07,070
as I told you, through our centers getting 
exhausted.

4
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,870
As this is one center, all right, on the left 
side, left sympathetic,

5
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,240
and right sympathetic, and they join together, 
this is the center.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,330
So we are using the energy of this center 
that is limited, for our purpose, anything.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,580
Supposing, I’ll give an example, of a very 
good example of our Swadisthan chakra.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,619
It’s the second center which looks after 
the aortic plexus in the medical terminology,

9
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,699
but it’s not complete, I mean it’s one 
of the parts.

10
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,309
Now the work of the Swadisthan chakra,

11
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,199
according to Sahaja Yoga, which has worked 
of course, wonders with this theory,

12
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,539
that it gives energy for the replacement of 
the brain cells.

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,170
Because we never think about it, we are using 
the brain all the time,

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,600
we don’t think how it is replaced, even 
within the medical art they don't think about

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,129
it.

16
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,280
So one of the work it has got, it moves here 
and also it has to look after your liver,

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,539
it has to look after your pancreas,

18
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,970
it has to look after spleen,

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,790
it has to look after your kidneys,

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,600
it has to also look after the lower part of 
your large intestines.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Alright?

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Now.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,690
But all the time a person is thinking,

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,040
these days every body thinks too much and 
very futuristic.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,740
As a result, it cannot pay attention to all 
other things.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,920
So what happens, the first thing which is 
affected it the liver.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,890
Now, liver gets all the heat from the all 
body and eliminates it -

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,320
it’s poison for the body you can say - eliminates 
it into the blood circulation,

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,840
it goes into the blood.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,670
Now when, you see, liver is not attended to 
or doesn’t get sufficient energy,

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,280
starts working very hard, so it becomes an 
over active liver and this heat cannot be

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
removed,

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,780
so the heat starts rising upward and downwards.

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
As a result, your - these,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,420
what you call - the lungs are made as you 
know,

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:17,930
they are made like a sponge, so it becomes 
coagulated and you develop asthma.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,260
We cure asthma through liver.

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Incurable.

39
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,140
Then it descends down, when it descends down,

40
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,079
it affects your kidneys.

41
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,060
By that you get high blood pressure.

42
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,469
Also, another thing you get is constipation.

43
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,180
Then your pancreas is neglected.

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,609
When pancreas is neglected you get diabetes.

45
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:52,359
Only the people who are thinking sitting, 
planning for future get diabetes, never a villager.

46
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,459
In India, if you go to a village,

47
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,889
they’ll say : “you have to put sugar as 
much as the spoon must stand at a right angle.”

48
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:01,940
They take so much sugar, nobody gets diabetes,

49
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,980
because they earn in the morning, nicely go 
home and sleep off.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,900
When we think and think, and think of the 
future.

51
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,140
So the neglect of the pancreas gives you diabetes.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,519
Now we have many people who have cured diabetes 
also.

53
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,030
Then the third one is the worse, is the spleen,

54
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,840
that the spleen is like, you say rhythm, gives 
the rhythm,

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,459
it’s a in speedometer in us.

56
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,650
And supposing you are eating the food and 
suddenly you have to run,

57
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,040
then you get a pain because it has to produce 
red blood corpuscles.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,579
But if you are always in an emergency in modern 
times,

59
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,010
as you are, first of all you read the newspaper,

60
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,029
you are under shock, because newspaper must 
shock you, you see.

61
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,919
So, then another shock, then another shock.

62
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,629
Then in the traffic, you get a shock.

63
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,969
So this poor spleen doesn’t know how to 
behave

64
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:02,090
in this crazy world and it becomes very crazy 
and vulnerable.

65
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,149
And with the slightest shock, it can get blood 
cancer.

66
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,650
I must tell you that we have cured really 
blood cancer patients.

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,489
Absolutely cured, completely cured,

68
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,499
without any medicine or anything, absolutely 
cured.

69
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,670
We have certificates and everything about 
them.

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,130
And surprisingly, all of them were architects.

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,220
This is one.

72
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,121
Then, another thing that I told you,

73
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:30,660
it affects the kidneys and it affects also 
the lower intestines.

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,400
So, only one center, if you use it too much 
for one purpose,

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,150
can give you all these troubles.

76
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,200
And ultimately the heat might rise to the 
heart and you may have a massive heart attack.

77
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Specially, if young people, if they are drinking 
too much,

78
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,850
if they are playing tennis or which is very 
– I mean any game which is like football

79
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,040
or tennis,

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,260
drinking too much and thinking too much,

81
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,310
they might get a massive heart attack and 
die very young, at a very young age.

82
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,040
I mean it’s absolutely fatal.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,220
If you get this attack at a young age, it’s 
fatal, you cannot save them.

84
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,840
The other way round, if you are - if you have 
inactive organs also,

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,870
you can have inactive also due to that, 
also you get troubles.

86
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,900
So when you treat somebody on his roots, it’s 
very easy to solve the problem.

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,130
See, supposing you have to treat a tree and 
you start treating all the leaves, it’s

88
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,130
very difficult.

89
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,970
But if you can go to the roots, it’s so 
easy, it’s simple.
