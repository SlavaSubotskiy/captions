1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:09,970
I bow to all the seekers of truth. So much
has been said and really my heart is full

2
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:25,980
of gratitude for all of you to come here,
all the way, and the way people have described

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,980
about Sahaja Yoga. To understand Sahaja Yoga,
we should know where are we today in this

4
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,570
Kali Yuga. What are we facing today? It should
really make you feel quite disturbed to see

5
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:55,830
the way things are going on in every country,
everywhere. What's the problem? What is the,

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,400
such a need for people to become so restless,
full of tensions. Collectively, country-wise,

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,040
anywhere you go you find some sort of a confusion.
Terrible. The whole society seems to be boiling

8
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,310
with a kind of a fear of destruction. What
is the reason?

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,340
There are so many religions, so many organized,
disorganized, all kinds of things. There are

10
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,729
so many sadhus and saints. There are so many
books written about what you should have.

11
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:53,250
But the only one who is a seeker of truth
should see one point: Why, why there is so

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,680
much problem in this world and how can you
help them? Where is the problem? It is inside

13
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,950
the human being. As described, you see, we
have come out of a animal stage to a human

14
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,590
stage. We have a human awareness, no doubt.
In that awareness, we start seeing all kinds

15
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,590
of things that are not good, which are destructive,
which are disturbing. If it doesn't disturb

16
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,840
you, that means you are not at all a sensitive
person. But you are sensitive as a human being.

17
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,840
So now what is the reason for this, is there.
In every field of life, whether it is political,

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
economic or any field of life in which human
beings are living, there's a very subtle problem

19
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:07,209
which people don't understand. Now if I say
that, "There is spirit within us which shines

20
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,730
in our heart," you need not believe, need
not believe. But our attention is not on the

21
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:26,390
spirit. They call it "atma vimukh" - our attention
is outside. At this stage at the human awareness,

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
our attention is outside, outside in various
things. Now where should our attention go?

23
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,950
To evolve, for what? To achieve what? The
firstly, our attention has now go towards

24
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,780
our spirit, towards spiritual understanding.
This is one thing has to happen to human beings

25
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,870
to begin with. Otherwise our attention is
outside. We are worried about money, worried

26
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,829
about power, worried about this, worried about
that, in competition and all kinds of things

27
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,829
going on. But if your attention is turned
somehow towards your spirit then what happens

28
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,900
to you is that you become a power of the spirit.
And the power of the spirit is the highest

29
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,250
power that you could think of.

30
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,250
First of all, spirit is the one that loves.
Loves without asking for anything, without

31
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:03,180
expecting anything, just loves. It's an unconditional
type of a personality which just emits love.

32
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Anybody in trouble, anybody having a problem,
just it flows. This capacity to flow in the

33
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,800
heart exists but on top of that, is the closing
point, is that our attention is not on our

34
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,340
spirit. Even in political endeavors or your
economic endeavors, any endeavor, what happens

35
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:40,979
is that attention is outside. So you go into
competition, you go into this thing, you go

36
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,520
on becoming very competent and then suddenly
you find another one coming up. There are

37
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,550
so many struggles when your attention is outside.
Because in attention outside, there is no

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,560
purity. There is no purity. It's just attention
to yourself and that too is so limited. Very

39
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,080
limited it is because if you pay attention
to yourself, there's no end to your troubles

40
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:26,490
and woes. For a person, as they said, really
is fact that: I don't mind sleeping anywhere.

41
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,930
I don't mind eating anything. I am not bothered
about all these things, is a fact. Because,

42
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,729
you see, it's not very important I think.
But without thinking, I am made like that.

43
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:46,729
I am like that, all right. But Sahaja yogis
have become like this. This is the miracle

44
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,740
that human beings have turned their attention
to their spirit. Then you are amazed how things

45
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:01,919
work out. Without any competition, without
any fights, without any quarrels, how your

46
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,910
attention becomes fixed on your spirit.

47
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:16,910
First, the first thing that happens to you
is good health. Your health improves. Firstly,

48
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:26,330
if your health is all right, I mean so many
problems are solved. This world, I think at

49
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:32,650
least 30% people are always sick. Because
of the tensions, maybe because of bad food

50
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:39,650
and this and that. This is first thing that
happens to you is your health improves. Today

51
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,160
now in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who have
learned that by these modern ways of economics

52
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,470
and all that, has not given any peace to anyone.
We think of America; I mean I've been to America,

53
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,690
I know Americans: How terribly disturbed they
are. Their families are ruined. Their children

54
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,550
are ruined. And all kinds of stupid things
are happening. Our Indian gurus are going

55
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,550
and making a big money there. And they just
want peace. They just want peace of the heart.

56
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,130
That's only possible when your attention goes
to your heart because in the heart resides

57
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:27,130
the spirit and the spirit is the source of
peace. First is the love and second as I told

58
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,889
you just now is the peace.

59
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:40,860
You become extremely peaceful. You become
like a witness and you see the whole drama

60
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,860
like a joke. It's nothing so serious to be
worried about. It all works out. And this

61
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,970
is what one has to become is to become the
spirit which is your own, which is in your

62
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,040
own heart and that is the source, as I told
you, of love and again I say of peace. And

63
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:12,739
the third thing that happens to you, that
the source of spirit being joy, that joy bubbles

64
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,100
in your life. It just bubbles in your life.
You don't know how to get out of that great

65
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:31,149
ocean of joy. You start swimming in it, enjoying
it, every bit of it. You touch all the shores,

66
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:40,119
going round the whole world, their hearts
and everything. It is in the heart that resides.

67
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,850
Again I say, it is not in the brain. No mental
activity can take you to spirit. Spirit is

68
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,929
only possible if your attention could be somehow
taken to the spirit. And that's possible only

69
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,220
through Kundalini awakening.

70
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:07,220
This change of attitude towards life, this
change of complete peace and joy has come

71
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,850
to you all because your attention is now on
your spirit. Now you don't think of money,

72
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:24,299
money walks your way. You don't think of power,
power walks your way. And the power of the

73
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:31,319
spirit is the highest, the most powerful and
the most righteous thing. It is not necessary

74
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,360
that you should become a sanyasi, sadhu baba,
do all kinds of things. No necessity of these

75
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,899
rituals. The spirit is residing within you.
Already all you have done in last lives. Now

76
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,809
this life only thing you have to do is to
put attention to your spirit. And that's only

77
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:02,809
possible through the awakening of this Kundalini
- the Primordial Mother. When She starts,

78
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,519
I mean that's also your own. When She starts
rising, She passes through the centers and

79
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:19,819
enriches them, integrates them, and pierces
through the last fontanel bone area and makes

80
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,279
you connected to this all pervading power
of divine love. But this power of divine love

81
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:36,809
is not only "the love," if you want to say,
it is also peace and joy and also it is the

82
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,699
superior wisdom.

83
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:51,079
It is rather subtle for normal man to understand.
I know that. I've gone through that. For persons

84
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:58,079
to understand that one can become the spirit
.. but this is in the evolutionary process.

85
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:05,350
Today is the time for people to become the
spirit. This is the blessing of this blossom

86
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,459
time as I call it and people have to become
the spirit. Otherwise what is left of them

87
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:19,459
is like all other human beings who'll, I don't
where they'll end up. So this is an essential

88
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,660
step today to become the spirit. All the saints,
all the prophets, all the religions have talked

89
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:33,329
about it. Not that they have not. Of course,
we have twisted them. We have made separate,

90
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:40,329
separate things. But it's only one simple
thing is that you are a spirit and that spirit,

91
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,730
unless and until you become, you cannot achieve
any peace, any joy and no love.

92
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:03,149
The Sahaja yogis here are sitting have achieved
it. They don't think they are from foreign

93
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:13,829
countries or from this country or that country.
They don't want. Now here it is in this camp

94
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:20,629
we don't have very good arrangement for sleeping
or eating or anything, no good bathrooms,

95
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:26,480
nothing. They are just enjoying themselves.
Nobody minds it. Of course certain things

96
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,480
of particular country may linger on. But then
it drops, it drops. Gradually it starts dropping

97
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:42,709
out. Like a flower when it becomes the fruit.
All its petals and everything drops out and

98
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:50,689
then it becomes the fruit. So you have now
become the fruit -fruit of knowledge, fruit

99
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:58,389
of wisdom and of love. For knowledge, you
don't have to read books. There's no need

100
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:06,259
to. People who have read too many are difficult
to get Sahaja Yoga. But what you have to see

101
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:13,709
yourself: What is the reality? But that's
only possible if you are a realized soul.

102
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,929
Otherwise you get lost in the illusions of
the world. You live with the illusions all

103
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:27,149
your life, struggling, fighting and I don't
want to say what's the end is.

104
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:33,449
So a simple thing that has happened with Sahaja
Yoga, in your evolutionary process your attention

105
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:40,449
now has gone to spirit than to anything else.
As soon as the power of the spirit comes,

106
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:48,989
you find yourself successful in everything.
You don't want;. You don't ask for it and

107
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,179
if you are not, you don't mind. You don't
mind because you think they don't understand.

108
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:03,179
It's all right, forget it. So there's no use
fighting for it, asking for it. For this,

109
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:11,309
one thing is important, first and foremost
thing, you have to forgive everyone.

110
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:18,230
Human beings, I don't know sometimes they're
illogical. Supposing somebody tries to harm

111
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:25,230
you. All right, I forgive him. Forget it because
I have no headache of that. What he is trying

112
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:31,579
to do is to give me a headache which I will
not take. I just forgive. So that is a very

113
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:37,019
important point, that Christ has also said
that, "You have to forgive." Mohammad Sahib

114
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,179
has said so many things but I don't know how
people have twisted. Christ has said so many

115
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,399
things, how I don't know how they are being
twisted. Every one of them has said one thing:

116
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,399
that you have to become the Spirit. And how
people have twisted it and have formed so

117
00:15:55,979 --> 00:16:02,109
many religions and in that religion why should
they quarrel? If there is one God there should

118
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:03,779
be no quarrel.

119
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,579
Now in Sahaja yoga, you find people have come
from different race, different countries,

120
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,829
different ideologies, everything. One thing
great about Sahaja yogis, they are very pure

121
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:20,169
people. There's so much of purity in them.
There's no problem. I do not have that problem

122
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:27,169
of immorality in Sahaja Yoga. We don't find
anybody being immoral. If somebody has been

123
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:36,459
immoral, he just gets corrected. If somebody
has been cheating, he gets corrected. If somebody

124
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:44,629
has been a corrupt person, he gets corrected.
Because spirit gives the light for you to

125
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:54,509
see for yourself what is good for you. Supposing
you are going on a road and you are blind.

126
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,249
You can walk into a ditch. But supposing you
have the light and the eyes open. You know

127
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:07,019
how to go. And that's exactly what has happened
in Sahaja Yoga, that people have realized

128
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:14,019
how to move, how to go about, how to walk,
and not to fall in the ditch. I have seen

129
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:21,549
people who have fallen into ditch also. But
I have nothing but love for them. Because

130
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:27,709
they were blind, you see, for a blind person
you can just have love, isn't it? And I found

131
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,240
that once I forgive them completely and I
ask them, all right, even if they have abused

132
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,639
Me, said things against Me, it's all right.
Because they don't know what they are doing.

133
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:46,639
They are blind people. So once you feel that
way about others, that doesn't matter. Whatever

134
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:55,039
they have done, whatever they have so far,
so called harmed you also, is no harm to you

135
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,539
because you are standing on a pedestal of
truth.

136
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:08,539
So the second point is that the spirit is
the source of truth, not of untruth. For example,

137
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,370
there is some false guru. Immediately you
will know who is false. How? On your vibrations,

138
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,340
on your fingertips you know that this man
is false. Is all said by Mohammad Sahib that,

139
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:31,190
"Your hands will speak at the time of resurrection."
That exactly happens that you see: this is

140
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:38,100
the trouble. Now if you want you can avoid
that person or if you want you can bring him

141
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:45,100
round and put him right. But we should not
try on the complicated characters very much

142
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:51,419
in the beginning, I said, because they will
complicate you. Now those people who have

143
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:58,419
matured in Sahaja Yoga can easily manage that
also. And also we must know that all the elements

144
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,570
are working for us. All the events of the
world are just to show how wrong things are

145
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,740
wrong and how right things should be done.

146
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,620
Say for example, when Hitler came. He started
destroying people. And he took nine years

147
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:24,620
to build himself up. And he did all kinds
of things which cannot be forgiven by anyone.

148
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,820
But he died and suddenly you find in Germany,
people are so enlightened. Now you heard some

149
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,860
people, I was amazed how they are so enlightened
about love and about the divine. All these

150
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:48,159
countries, I've seen are doing so well unexpectedly.

151
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:54,169
Imagine in England, who came to India and
ruled us for three hundred years, there are

152
00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:01,169
so many Sahaja yogis. And also as you see
today when I speak there, we have the whole

153
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:09,529
hall filled up with people, in England. I've
seen also in the countries like Russia, where

154
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:17,830
these people were on the verge of collapsing
after they started on democracy. Whether it

155
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,120
is democracy or communism or anything, these
are all isms. You have to come out of it and

156
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,490
see for yourself that so called democracy
has become demon-ocracy. So called communism

157
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:40,490
has failed. Why? Basically what's wrong with
them? It was all based not on the spiritual

158
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:48,309
level. There was no spirit involved in it.
It was all based on, I should say, on the

159
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,220
endeavors which are outside, which were very
limited. And those limits, once they break,

160
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,129
you see you have a problem.

161
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:08,559
Now economics, the world economics if you
see is collapsing. Everywhere there is recession.

162
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,350
If they are such experts then why there is
recession? Why there are problems? Now the

163
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:22,350
people say we must remove the poverty. I agree
but not by giving some sort of a beggar's

164
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:29,529
gift but with self respect. You can do it.
You can do it because if you can approach

165
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:42,710
people who need with Sahaja Yoga and enrich
them, you'll be amazed, they themselves will

166
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:52,570
do better and work it out. All kinds of things,
you see, like in abroad people used to say,

167
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,049
"Mother, You talk of spiritual life then why
is it India is so poor?" I said, "They are

168
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:06,049
not so poor in spirituality." They may be
poor in money. Those who have got lots of

169
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,080
money, are they also very good people? Are
they also doing something very good? In the

170
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,549
same way, those who are poor are not doing
something good that one should have compassion

171
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:25,549
on them. Agreed. Now what to do? If both sides
are so miserable, what should we do? Is to

172
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:32,750
change them. Change the whole attitude towards
life. Immediately I've seen people who are

173
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:40,740
supposed to be rich start understanding poverty.
They start sharing. They start working it

174
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:44,929
out.

175
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,929
In Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed how people
help each other. How they work out everybody's

176
00:22:53,690 --> 00:23:00,690
difficulties and problems into something very
beautiful. You see, it's the wisdom that you

177
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,320
get from this all pervading divine power.
This power has been described in every religion.

178
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,450
You call it nirakar, you call it ruuh, you
can call it paramchaitanya; you can call by

179
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,450
any name. But name is not the point. Whatever
it is, once you are connected with this power,

180
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,490
you are blessed. Thousand times you are blessed
than you are as a normal human being. As a

181
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:33,840
normal being, no blessings it has. It has
nothing but your own endeavors that the amount

182
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,840
you push in, that's what you get. Here nobody
pushes oneself. Automatically you are pushed

183
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:48,629
into that. This force, divine force brings
you to that. And you have seen that in your

184
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:54,070
own lives how you came to Me, how you came
to Sahaja Yoga. It was some sort of a divine

185
00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:01,070
force which worked it out, which is Sahaja,
which you may not realize but when you get

186
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:09,200
your realization, you just think about your
own life: "How I came to Sahaja Yoga? How

187
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,200
I got this?" And then you see this peace,
reigning over your hearts. The love, affection,

188
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,389
everything. What is, as you said, I have many
powers, maybe I don't know, but one thing

189
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:31,389
for definite, one thing that Sahaja yogis
can get all My powers.

190
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,720
As a Mother, Mother wants to give everything
to Sahaja yogis. This greatest joy for a Mother

191
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:58,070
is to see Her son or daughter grow up like
Her. I, I have a great vision of life. And

192
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:13,039
I see the picture of that here today. I was
a ordinary housewife without much money. You

193
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:20,389
know My interest in money is zero. I don't
understand even the bank and the somebody

194
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:26,419
has to sign a cheque for Me. My husband has
to count My money, I am so bad. But still

195
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,419
I've never had problem. Never had problem
because it is the greed in man, terrible greed

196
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:43,629
in man that creates problems. But if he learns
how to be satisfied, automatically the greed

197
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:50,620
drops out and you feel absolutely comfortable.
But that doesn't mean that you become a sadhu

198
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:57,620
baba or you become a sanyasi or a something
you give up. Those days are gone. Those ordeals

199
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:01,669
you have passed through. You've been to the
Himalayas. You've stood on your heads and

200
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,419
did all kinds of things.

201
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:10,419
Now no more is needed. What is needed is that:
you have to put your attention to your spirit,

202
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:17,759
the more you do it, the more you absorb all
other attentions and put it to your spirit,

203
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:27,529
which is there already existing. There is
nothing to be brought from outside or nothing

204
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:34,529
to be learnt. It is inside every one of you,
is in the heart. Only thing you have to, you

205
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:42,669
have to just feel it. Now that feeling can
only come if you are awakened in the Kundalini.

206
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:51,519
I know that no one like Mohammad Sahib or
Christ or Abraham or Moses, who have created

207
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:05,299
books or whatever history they have created,
no where They would have ever thought that

208
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:13,139
people will form an organized religion and
start in a way as if they are against each

209
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,960
other. But it has happened. It has happened.
To remove that, you have to give them the

210
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:30,309
knowledge, the pure knowledge. Not the knowledge
of the book but the pure knowledge. And the

211
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:37,309
knowledge that is pure is wisdom. Through
this wisdom only I've worked. This wisdom

212
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,490
I had from My childhood. Nobody has given
Me. It's there. But this wisdom has taught

213
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:51,490
Me one thing: that whatsoever maybe the condition
of a human being, whatsoever maybe his style,

214
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,100
whatsoever may be his ego or his conditioning
if he can feel the love then his spirit gets

215
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,929
[transformed?].

216
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:11,919
This transformation has taken place. Here
we have only one percent of the people who

217
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,679
have got realization all over the world. But
I know, I remember them all today who are

218
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:25,679
not here, that they have been seekers, madly
seeking, seeking the truth. They went through

219
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,139
horrible time seeking. They had very bad gurus.
They had all kinds of expenses, everything

220
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:43,080
they did. But once they came to Sahaja Yoga,
they have found what was the truth is. And

221
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,080
the truth is very simple: that you are the
spirit. You are not this body, this mind,

222
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:58,549
but you are the spirit. This is the truth
and they have found the spirit. That's what

223
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:05,549
is the truth that they have found. Once this
truth is established within you, that you

224
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,950
are the spirit, nothing can destroy you, nothing
can harm you. It cannot have any wants. It

225
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,039
doesn't have. What wants can you have when
you have the spirit because such a satisfying

226
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:28,039
thing? It doesn't condemn anyone. It doesn't
runs after anyone. Is satisfied with itself,

227
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:34,139
absolutely satisfied.

228
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:40,970
You see, I was very anxious that I should
lead a very normal life. I should not be like

229
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:47,970
some Himalaya fellow or something like that.
Because this is needed for a common people.

230
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:57,149
Today it's a aim en mass, en mass awakening.
It is not for one person.

231
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:05,679
This was the thing because once any discovery
is made, supposing, and that discovery only

232
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,879
is for one individual, it has no meaning.
It has to go to masses. And this is what I

233
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:18,879
knew: I have to do it. And I had to work - they
say so but I don't think I ever worked. I

234
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,519
was just witness to whole thing. I saw it
just like a witness enjoying all kinds of

235
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:33,519
things as you sit on the shore of a ocean.
You see waves coming, going like that. But

236
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:41,090
inside, inside that is a human being who wants
to evolve, who wants to become the spirit.

237
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:52,080
Then he starts thinking what good he can do
to others. So far I've been very anxious that

238
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,080
people should become Sahaja yogis. I didn't
take to any missionary work or any social

239
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,999
work. I used to do when I was not in Sahaja
Yoga, I should say, when I didn't start the

240
00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:10,999
Sahaja Yoga. But later on, I discovered that
unless and until you transform people, unless

241
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,700
and until you become the spirit, you'll become
like any other social worker.

242
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:26,700
I was working in a, say, blind school. I was
the chairman of the blind school, blind people.

243
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,419
And I was surprised, the people who were with
Me were very funny type you know? The governor

244
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:41,419
was to come and they said, "Who will sit next
to governor?" I said, "What is this?" So they

245
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,159
said also, "I being the president, I have
to sit." I said, "Not necessary. I can sit

246
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,629
anywhere." But they all started quarreling
on this point. So I said, "All right, we'll

247
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:59,629
take a plank and put it on head of the - of
the governor and you all sit on that like

248
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:07,549
sparrows." That humor helped a lot and they
settled down. So this is the stupid thing

249
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:14,549
where you see it, what is your position, what
do you get? I mean it's so stupid that even

250
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:22,559
the ant knows how to work out the collectivity.
I don't know how human beings are dying after

251
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:31,019
useless nonsensical things. But the only thing
is, he has not yet become the spirit. So he

252
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:38,730
doesn't respect himself, no respect. So he
does all these things which are not very respectable

253
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,440
I think. Then I thought that this kind of
work people are doing, they think no end of

254
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,600
themselves.

255
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Once you start doing something good, why should
you think you are very great? I, I can't understand,

256
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,190
you see, My brain is that way useless. Because
what I found with these people who were working

257
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:09,200
with Me, very anxious to take the credit for
this. Somebody wanted to become the chairman,

258
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,200
vice-chairman. I said, "You become everything."
So the attention being on your promotion,

259
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:23,230
it's not a real promotion, no promotion. Everybody
used to laugh at them, it's a degradation.

260
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:32,739
Your promotion is not through your own being
but through your own spirit. Being means a

261
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:43,419
very big thing, I think, but spirit is very
subtle, very beautiful which is residing in

262
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,720
all of you like a light. It's a light in you.

263
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,549
Now there are Sahaja, so many Sahaja yogis
who are giving enlightenment to others. There

264
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:59,549
are people who are going all over the world.
I was surprised that people from Germany and

265
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Austria came to help Me when I first went
to Russia. I said, "What are you doing here?"

266
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:15,470
Said, "Mother we have to do something because
so many people were killed by our forefathers."

267
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:22,470
Then My heart started really thanking them.
Look at this, what has come into them? Then

268
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:30,869
they went, you'll be amazed, to Israel and
from Israel they brought lots of Sahaja yogis

269
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:37,079
to Egypt. So I asked the Israelis, Sahaja
yogis, "Why are you here?" They said, "Mother

270
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:44,079
it's our job now to make friends with these
Sahaja yogis from Egypt." Just see how love

271
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,200
engulfs all these angularities, all these
thorns of life and dissolves it completely.

272
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:02,319
It's so joy giving to see your love acting
on others. Small, small things and very big

273
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,480
things, all that works out with love.

274
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,480
For example, in an industry now people have
problems of strikes. Very common struggle,

275
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:32,049
haves and have not and this going on. But
if you can raise the people to the spiritual

276
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:39,049
height, to their spiritual need which is the
most important need today, you'll be amazed

277
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,359
there will be no problem of any kind. You
see, it is a kind of a communism. It's a kind

278
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:56,809
of a socialism. It's a kind of a democracy.
It's all things put together which works.

279
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:05,690
Democracy means we have Sahaja yogis who wanted
to organize this. They said, "Mother what

280
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:13,160
should we do?" I said, "I am not going to
say anything. You do what you like. You choose

281
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,880
whatever you like, whatever you want to do."
And I was just busy arranging the flowers

282
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,910
in the house because so many flowers came
and I am worried about the flowers. I was

283
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,530
just arranging the flowers in the house. And
what I find, now see how they've done: no

284
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:37,530
quarrel, no fight, no discussion, nothing.
How have they done? Otherwise you cannot make

285
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:43,670
ten people sit together and talk the same
way. One will talk, another will talk, another

286
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:49,839
will talk, will go on discussing, discussing
this, reaching nowhere. Otherwise only one

287
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,839
man has to work it out, otherwise nothing
can work. So you see, it changes the whole

288
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:04,530
atmosphere of every human being. Changes his
attitude, changes his endeavors and everything

289
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:14,490
becomes so beautiful and joy giving.

290
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:21,190
You are a socialist also because you start
thinking about the people who are down trodden,

291
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:28,190
people who have no money who are poor, and
you try to work out something by which they

292
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,809
get some money.

293
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:38,809
I used to go with My father for a case in
a district called Chanda. And there I saw

294
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,040
people just with one cloth around them. What
was shocking to Me: just one cloth, whether

295
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:55,069
it is winter or summer. I used to weep so
My father would say, "Why to weep before them?"

296
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I said, "What can I do? I must try to do something
for them." Now when I got so many Sahaja yogis,

297
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I told them, "I want to help these people
somehow. And what they make is pottery." So

298
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:19,770
they said, "Mother, all right. You can get
the pottery. We'll import here and we'll sell

299
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:25,500
them." You'll be amazed now, these people
have got houses, they have got a good life

300
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,500
to live and they are living very well. So
in a way, it is a kind of a socialism. That

301
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:39,839
you see problems and you know collectively
to solve it, collectively, not singularly

302
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,670
but collectively.

303
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:48,660
The all of the Sahaja yogis suggest, "Mother,
this can be solved." So far I have not done

304
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,660
anything directly, I must say, like starting
a organization of that kind. But now when

305
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:02,160
there are so many Sahaja yogis with their
attention on their heart, now My attention

306
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,740
is going to the people who need our help.
So first time, I have asked them to make an

307
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,740
NGO for destitute women and for children who
are being deserted by their parents. And immediately,

308
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:23,530
you'll be amazed, it all did. We got the land.
We got the people. I mean, I'm not doing anything

309
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:30,420
and it's all done. Moreover, so many people
have written, "Mother if You want land, we

310
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,950
can give You. You come here, do this, do that."
Can you imagine? Once I just thought of it:

311
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,540
that we have to do something for the poor
people. Also other so many things can be done

312
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:49,540
with your attention which is pure, full of
love because the love, you see, is something

313
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:57,660
that gives you the wisdom how to do it. If
you have love, it gives you the complete insight

314
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,720
into the problems and how it works.

315
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,720
See it's surprising for Me, I mean, I used
to do that always but even after Sahaja Yoga

316
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,180
I found that is the love is the solution.
Is this only way we can enter into the hearts

317
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:29,950
of people. But for that love, we should not
try to do it for some money or for some achievements

318
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:37,859
or for some sort of a reward, but just the
whim of the love and that is what is today

319
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:47,119
paying all of you: The way you love all the
people. The way you have done so much work.

320
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:54,119
You don't know what gratitude I have for you.
Single-handed I could not have done it. I

321
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,309
could not have gone to so many countries.
It's a like a place like Benin, where there

322
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:04,170
are only Muslims are there, I would never
- I could never have thought of going to that

323
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,809
far fetched place where these people are there
and imagine these people are Muslims and they

324
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:17,809
have all taken to Sahaja Yoga. And in that
they are understanding the beauty of love.

325
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:24,890
You, this is done by French. Can you believe
these French? Going down all the way to Benin

326
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:33,530
and getting it done. Even English have gone
all the way to different countries; even the

327
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:40,730
Austrians and also Germans and Italians are
another quality of people who have a very

328
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:51,520
rich heart, I must say. They have a very rich
heart and the way they are spreading Sahaja

329
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,520
Yoga throughout Italy is really remarkable.
I am amazed how these people are approaching

330
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,760
all these people who have never known what
is spirit is and how they are getting them

331
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:08,359
to Mother.

332
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:14,510
Now with that, you see, we don't have to say
"prohibition." We don't have to say "don't

333
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:20,520
take drugs," nothing. No don'ts in Sahaja
Yoga. Automatically they drop. I don't have

334
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,220
to say, "Don't do it." Just automatically
they drop.

335
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,220
I mean you'll be amazed, once we had a program
and there was a light to be put in a one of

336
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:40,819
the deepas and nobody had a matchbox. Can
you imagine? Nobody has a matchbox. Is such

337
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:45,900
a problem with thousands of people there,
nobody has matchbox. So we had to send somebody

338
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,900
to get the matchbox. There's no need. So I
never say, "Don't do this," never. I've never

339
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:59,859
said it but it has worked like that, it has
worked. I don't know how, how you have dropped

340
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:06,849
it but it's very simple when the light of
the spirit is there. In that light, you just

341
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,630
don't.

342
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:16,630
Now all the people have said, "Don't drink."
Say for example: Sikhs, Muslims but you see

343
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,410
they all drink because they are not really
Muslims, they are not really Sikhs. If they

344
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:31,410
were really that, they would not have drunk.
How is it possible then? They have to be the

345
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,450
spirit. In the light of the spirit, we just
don't do anything that is destructive, just

346
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:42,660
don't do it. You don't have to tell anybody.
Now you are all sitting here, you know that

347
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:49,280
I've never told you anyone, "Don't do this."
But I was amazed in London that people overnight

348
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,280
gave up drugs, overnight. People employ military,
this, that drugs is [INAUDIBLE]. They gave

349
00:43:56,549 --> 00:44:02,980
up prostitution. They gave (up) drugs, all
kinds of destructive things to which human

350
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:09,980
being take sometimes out of frustration and
sometimes because they feel very lonely.

351
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:17,289
But now in Sahaja Yoga, you can never be lonely.
All over the world, you have brothers and

352
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:22,670
sisters. If they come to know somebody is
there somebody is coming, they'll all go to

353
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:29,670
the airport to receive. It's not a brotherhood
of a ordinary life. It's a very deep type

354
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,309
of a brotherhood. It's a very deep understanding.
But they are very deep people, I must say,

355
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:45,309
because they have been seekers and in that
seeking they have really got completely into

356
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,020
a turmoil and that has made them very deep
people.

357
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,020
This book is "Light of Quran" is written by
a lady Gilmet. You read it. I would request

358
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:03,339
you to read it because she is so deep. I knew
she was very deep but the way she has expressed

359
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:10,339
is so beautiful, so joy giving that she's
not a Muslim, she married a Muslim, so called,

360
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:17,859
because they were all Sahaja yogis and the
way she has narrated her seeking is so beautiful.

361
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:24,059
We have so many big writers in Sahaja Yoga
who have given very, very nice books and things.

362
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:30,510
But this Gilmet is very shy. She doesn't talk.
She keeps quiet. But inside, she's so deep

363
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,670
because of her seeking.

364
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:39,670
So there are many people in this world who
are seeking the truth because they cannot

365
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:47,130
bear the nonsense of modern world and they
are very sensitive. They are not insensitive,

366
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:55,380
very sensitive people. That's how you all
got your realization. It's nothing of Mine.

367
00:45:55,869 --> 00:46:02,170
To say that "I did it," is not proper. If
you were not like a candle, I could not have

368
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:09,170
enlightened you. So I am very thankful to
you. And I am so much enamored by the way

369
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:14,839
you people are feeling about Sahaja Yoga:
that collectively you have to work it out,

370
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,690
globally you have to work it out.

371
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:23,670
You have to help each other and bring up the
people. Most important thing is to create

372
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,670
a mind universally which is towards the spirit.
Then we'll solve all the problems, no problem.

373
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,500
Now if I say I am starting some sort of a
project here for the poor. Immediately all

374
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,380
of them will send Me money. Immediately they'll
all work. They'll find out who can work it

375
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,940
out, who can come and help Mother. What work
can we give them? How to work it out, all

376
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:56,940
over the world. I mean, it spreads so fast.
I have to just say that. I never asked for

377
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:04,289
money. I never said, "I need money," but immediately
they will plan out the whole thing, bring

378
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,770
the whole thing here and work it out.

379
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:13,130
It can work in India, it can work anywhere.
It's not just they are interested in India.

380
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:20,130
But globally they are interested in the problems.
It is not for making some sort of a show or

381
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:27,569
some sort of a, we can say, a cult. It is
something which is very innate, which is very

382
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:36,170
subtle and that works, that gives them joy.
That gives them joy to do something for Sahaja

383
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:43,170
Yoga. I am sometimes amazed how they feel
for the whole world, how they care for the

384
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,170
whole world, how they are willing to do for
[?].

385
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:56,170
Of course as I said, every country has some
problems. Like, we can say that north Indians

386
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,980
are interested always in politics because
Delhi is here. But is reduced now, very much

387
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:09,190
reduced now. There's not much going on. And
they don't like to hear anything against anyone.

388
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:16,190
That's a good thing. And in the south, we
can say in the beyond Narmada river, whatever

389
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,720
we have, Maharashtra and all that, they are
very ritualistic, very ritualistic people.

390
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,160
Even if they put the thali [thali MEANS PLATE
FOR DINING], you must put salt here, you must

391
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,650
put vegetable here, you .. so that a blind
man can also eat food properly. You must use

392
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:39,609
only one hand. You must keep another hand
tied up. They're very, very ritualistic because

393
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:44,380
of these two things, you see, in Sahaja Yoga
they do not grow.

394
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:51,349
Whatever it is, we have to understand that
these are [lingering PROBABLY ?] still are

395
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:57,869
behind us. For example in north India, I would
say if anybody speaks anything ill about anybody,

396
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:04,529
just put your. This principle of Gandhiji
was correct. Never listen to any nonsensical

397
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:11,230
gossip. Gossip is going on. People like to
listen to gossip because of this media also.

398
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:16,059
They were showing nothing but gossip before
election. And the whole gossip goes into our

399
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:22,230
mind and that's how we work out. So for this
part, I would request all the people from

400
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:29,230
the north India to never to listen any criticism,
never to criticize anyone. What is the use?

401
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:38,319
Just see logically: if you listen to somebody's
criticism, what is the use? What do you gain

402
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:45,529
out of it? Now by repeating it to somebody
else, what do you gain? What is the gain?

403
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:53,309
Simple thing, always ask the question: What
is the gain? And why to see something wrong

404
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:55,880
with others?

405
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,880
I know by that you can be cheated. Somebody
can deceive you, is true. But doesn't matter.

406
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,789
You don't get anything into your head. You
don't get any filth and any poison in your

407
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:17,089
head. I know there are people who create problem,
talk from one to another, do this, do that.

408
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:23,369
But that should not harm you in anyway because
you have the spirit and the spirit cannot

409
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:29,650
be harmed. It cannot be destroyed. It is said
that, "It cannot be destroyed by any weapon.

410
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:36,650
It lives and lives forever." So the attention
towards the atma is lacking, atma vimukta.

411
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:47,380
We, our eyes have gone, our attention is gone
to something away from the spirit and that's

412
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:57,289
why all the problems are there. Once you are
one with your spirit, it works. It works for

413
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:07,589
you because it is in connection with the God
almighty. It is in connection with the all

414
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,640
pervading power, which works out everything.
I know this all pervading power. It has showing

415
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:24,329
so many miraculous photographs about Me. And
actually I, I didn't ask It but It is doing.

416
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,420
Because very active, It is very active. And
if It sees anybody who is subtle and who is

417
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,829
deep, It acts.

418
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:39,700
In your business, in your politics, in your
family in everywhere you'll find this light

419
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:46,700
will shine and you'll respect, respect the
hearts of a person. You'll respect the love

420
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:58,319
of others. You will respect the spirit that
is shining in others. This is the reason why

421
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,299
you have learned to respect each other, because
your spirit is enlightened. I can see it so

422
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:06,549
clearly.

423
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:13,410
I am so very happy to see so many of you here
for My birthday. I don't know what is the

424
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:21,170
significance of a birthday is but whatever
it is, it is one of the things that I can

425
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:29,250
meet you, all of you here, so very happy.
I am thankful to these people who are elites

426
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:36,250
of our society. They are very great people
elected and sometimes given very high positions

427
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,440
and also there are some very well known industrialists.
All of them have to understand the value of

428
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:55,010
sprititual life. It's very important for them.
Not to avoid this point but to be one with

429
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:04,200
your spirit is your own property, is in your
own, I should say, the complete glory that

430
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:13,890
you have is to be the spirit. With all this,
I don't know how to thank you all and how

431
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:21,970
to thank all these people who spoke so nicely.
Only thing, I wish you all a great growth

432
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:30,039
in your spiritual life atmonnati, into your
spirituality so that it covers all the corners

433
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,260
of the world and create a beautiful world
of tomorrow.

434
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,480
May God bless you!
