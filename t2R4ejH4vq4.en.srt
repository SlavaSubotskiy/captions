1
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:56,227
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

2
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,034
They had planned everything.

3
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:03,514
They had all the arrangements made

4
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:06,185
and the sari was missing.

5
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:12,025
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

6
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:13,779
so now what to do?

7
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:18,161
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

8
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:21,372
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

9
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:23,706
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

10
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,684
otherwise we can have it later.

11
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,706
But I was least disturbed,

12
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:33,892
least upset.

13
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:38,344
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

14
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:41,970
But if you have a mental conception,

15
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,135
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

16
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:48,348
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

17
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:54,270
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

18
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:59,683
But that is what we cannot do.

19
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:01,938
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

20
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:05,236
This is what it is.

21
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:11,976
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

22
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,419
That’s one of the things.

23
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:18,256
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

24
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:23,913
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

25
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:27,509
because we make a mental projection.

26
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,909
Mentally we calculate something.

27
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:31,249
This has to be.

28
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:36,741
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

29
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:43,393
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

30
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,133
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

31
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:50,974
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

32
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:53,072
only about two o’clock.

33
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:54,432
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

34
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:58,256
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

35
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:04,682
So this is how you become avyagra.

36
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:09,235
Vyagra means person who is worried.

37
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,625
The one who is not worried.

38
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,211
So we worry because of two things.

39
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:23,317
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,237
Future doesn’t exist.

41
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:29,863
If you have made up your mind

42
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:31,628
that this should happen in the future,

43
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:35,397
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

44
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:39,000
But you have not made any mental picture,

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,318
you will see what comes on the scene.

46
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:46,051
You’ll watch whatever appears.

47
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,815
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

48
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,460
what’s going to happen.

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,076
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

50
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,807
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

51
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:07,889
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

52
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,108
and we are not having it.”

53
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,934
So you are upset.

54
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:15,810
What difference does it make?

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,149
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

56
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,445
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

57
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:28,102
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

58
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,438
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

59
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:34,737
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

60
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:39,394
We really decorated ourselves well.

61
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,192
We were all ready for the puja,

62
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,965
we were sitting here for the puja,

63
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,475
and now what has happened!

64
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:53,069
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

65
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:56,892
I knew what was coming.

66
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,788
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

67
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,211
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

68
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,304
I’m busy with Myself.

69
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:17,759
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

70
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:26,494
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

71
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:30,459
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

72
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,766
In India people come.

73
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:35,919
They keep so much money for buying things.

74
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,738
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

75
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,800
what you call traders.

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,826
The customs are so kind, I mean

77
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,025
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

78
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,456
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

79
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:50,484
And then they have a mental picture,

80
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:55,206
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

81
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:58,037
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

82
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:02,334
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

83
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,139
So then they might go to spend some money.

84
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,998
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

85
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,686
It has happened with all of you.

86
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,511
So they go and buy something.

87
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:19,534
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

88
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:23,047
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

89
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,244
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

90
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,165
How many pounds you paid for that?

91
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:32,031
Gavin: Forty pounds.

92
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,186
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

93
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,836
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

94
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,811
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

95
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:44,605
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

96
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,076
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

97
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:52,251
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

98
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,938
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

99
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:57,399
They thought they’ve bought something great.

100
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,831
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

101
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:02,613
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

102
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,510
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

103
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,497
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

104
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:12,469
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

105
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,993
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

106
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:21,346
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

107
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,747
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

108
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,291
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

109
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,412
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,303
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

111
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:35,079
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

112
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,171
He said, “What is the price?”

113
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,814
I said, “Forty pounds.”

114
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,889
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

115
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,515
And he bought it for forty pounds.

116
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:49,041
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

117
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:52,811
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

118
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:58,480
And I found it out that,

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,422
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

120
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:08,165
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

121
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:13,377
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

122
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:16,105
And if you start making it flexible then

123
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,710
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

124
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,314
very early. Now he’s different.

125
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:25,381
So if you become flexible,

126
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:29,277
then what happens you see the joy of it.

127
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:32,972
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

128
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:36,275
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

129
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,123
And you can never enjoy it,

130
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:44,169
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

131
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,565
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

132
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:49,407
You see it is all your own creation.

133
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:53,440
The mental projection is your creation,

134
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,383
and also the destruction is your creation.

135
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:04,052
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

136
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:08,487
But who does that is Mahamaya,

137
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,392
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

138
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:16,637
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

139
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,619
I have to go to Birmingham.

140
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:24,064
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

141
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:25,561
After some time you will find

142
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,859
that it’s impossible to do something,

143
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:32,410
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

144
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,287
Because whenever you will try to do something,

145
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,089
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

146
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,945
If not, then it will make you realize

147
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:46,192
what is important, what you’ve missed.

148
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:51,666
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

149
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:54,947
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

150
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:58,178
What to do? Now where to go?”

151
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,894
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

152
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,546
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

153
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,363
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

154
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:16,443
for days together. I just see that there.

155
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:27,898
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

156
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:32,660
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

157
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,232
at any cost.

158
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:41,102
Then that acts as a guide

159
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:47,694
and you understand the flexibility

160
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,683
of all these worldly, transitory things.

161
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,676
They are all changeable,

162
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:59,416
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

163
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:05,758
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

164
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:10,058
which is very important subject.

165
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:16,412
I think I have talked about it many a times.

166
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,705
But in the West I must say,

167
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:28,392
because of our wrong attitudes

168
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:38,379
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

169
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:42,326
of other people who are very dominating,

170
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:49,566
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

171
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:55,585
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

172
00:11:55,705 --> 00:12:00,624
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

173
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:04,158
and has sustained itself,

174
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,140
we must know that we can always fall a trap

175
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:19,556
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

176
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:25,788
It's a very serious matter

177
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:32,302
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

178
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:36,868
and we have created pathways

179
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:40,317
into which our attention can go

180
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:44,044
if we are not very careful.

181
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,365
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

182
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,958
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

183
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:59,083
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

184
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,495
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

185
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:06,740
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

186
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:17,809
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

187
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,681
sin against the Mother,

188
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:28,960
it's a secretive action

189
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,007
that's only between you and yourself.

190
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:38,989
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

191
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:43,799
Nobody knows what you are going to do

192
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:51,424
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

193
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:56,702
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

194
00:13:56,822 --> 00:14:00,127
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

195
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,452
To be very frank with you,

196
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:08,762
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

197
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:16,649
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

198
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,328
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

199
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,726
It is not bothered.

200
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:31,174
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

201
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,879
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

202
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,103
that's the action it plays all the time.

203
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:41,186
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

204
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,753
I mean the person is very close to Me,

205
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:45,973
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

206
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,882
But still I can?

207
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:53,556
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

208
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:57,029
immediately I can feel it.

209
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:03,311
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

210
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:07,112
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

211
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:09,569
do what you like.

212
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:16,653
Now for people who are Indian,

213
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:20,438
who have respected their Mooladharas,

214
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:23,379
there are so many methods and ways given

215
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:30,562
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

216
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:34,429
But that won't work out with the Western people,

217
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,169
because it's a damaged one.

218
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,036
It's one which is a shattered one,

219
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:45,712
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

220
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:49,909
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

221
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,683
the left side.

222
00:15:55,597 --> 00:16:01,091
So, even you may not talk in that way,

223
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:06,325
but your mind is still in that realm.

224
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:10,911
And you still think on that realm.

225
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:15,995
Even mentally, you are in it.

226
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:21,086
Or you are seeing things,

227
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,103
wanting to see such things,

228
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:27,541
wanting to enjoy such things.

229
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:31,821
That lurking attraction is still there,

230
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:35,141
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

231
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:42,554
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

232
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:47,402
I would not say the same to the people from India.

233
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,981
So now we have to work out much harder.

234
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:59,528
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

235
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:05,746
And it is more a mental activity.

236
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:12,342
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

237
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,268
You have to watch your mind.

238
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:20,041
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

239
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:27,745
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

240
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:32,098
Where is it going?

241
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,258
Where is this movement of our mind?

242
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:38,029
What is it doing?

243
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,891
You have to stand against your mind,

244
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,731
stand against your desires,

245
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,911
or you can face it

246
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:51,501
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

247
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,933
It's for you to decide.

248
00:17:56,071 --> 00:18:00,467
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

249
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,256
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

250
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,599
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

251
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,574
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

252
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:10,531
Whatever confessions you have made,

253
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,051
I burnt all those letters.

254
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:17,028
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

255
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,330
Nor do I want to know about it.

256
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,891
That's not My concern.

257
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:27,178
My concern is that now

258
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:34,938
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

259
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:39,807
on the same level,

260
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:44,408
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

261
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:50,611
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

262
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,805
the thoughts that come to you

263
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,293
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

264
00:18:56,413 --> 00:19:00,934
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

265
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:07,566
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

266
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:12,300
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

267
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,659
which you can ask.

268
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,552
But you cannot always say that,

269
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,252
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

270
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:22,191
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

271
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:26,842
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

272
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:40,166
You see a person as a Sakshi.

273
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:43,892
That means you see that person

274
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:48,424
but you do not get a reaction,

275
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:55,175
which is killer of joy.

276
00:19:57,484 --> 00:20:03,141
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

277
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:11,179
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

278
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:14,487
And be alert about it.

279
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,462
If you want to be kind to yourself,

280
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:24,538
know that you have to divert your attention

281
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:27,745
towards a sane married life.

282
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:31,867
But also that should not be too much.

283
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,845
Because what I have learnt now,

284
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:38,657
that in the West people have devised methods

285
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,186
of transferring their attention

286
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,097
from one person to another.

287
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:49,070
Mental acrobatics of different type

288
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,918
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

289
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,291
Don’t play onto these.

290
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:08,058
There are so many other things by which

291
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:12,280
we express that we are still under the trap

292
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,234
of a bad Mooladhara.

293
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,669
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

294
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,262
the way you sit, the way you talk,

295
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:31,603
the way you behave, to impress other people.

296
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:38,402
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

297
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:41,554
The only impression that should really work

298
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:48,093
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

299
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,672
You can do it; it's not difficult.

300
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:56,413
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

301
00:21:56,533 --> 00:22:01,242
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

302
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:05,624
But your question is first of all

303
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:08,421
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

304
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:14,246
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

305
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:17,784
That's why I say sometimes

306
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:22,116
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

307
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:26,944
especially the red meats and beefs,

308
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:31,831
and horses, and dogs

309
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:38,039
and I don't know what else you eat.

310
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,011
Take more to vegetarian food.

311
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,651
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

312
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:50,347
Take more to things

313
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:54,192
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

314
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:59,845
Even fish is very [inaudible].

315
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:04,854
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

316
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:10,515
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

317
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,015
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

318
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:16,364
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

319
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:21,132
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

320
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:25,737
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

321
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:29,731
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

322
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:36,471
So for you people,

323
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,854
(You have to go?)

324
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:48,263
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

325
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:53,848
that food does make a difference

326
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:57,758
in the powers of Mooladhara.

327
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:02,480
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

328
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,136
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

329
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:08,880
over-excited.

330
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,559
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

331
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,252
any woman you look at ...

332
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:16,876
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

333
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,333
Horrible.

334
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:22,714
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

335
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:28,332
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

336
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:31,095
There's no grace.

337
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:34,506
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

338
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:37,651
“you must respect yourself.”

339
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:41,380
It cannot work out with those words I know.

340
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:50,024
You have to sit down,

341
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:56,154
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

342
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,766
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

343
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,285
what things can be done about it,

344
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:06,249
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

345
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:10,418
But still this is all physical.

346
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:15,516
Mentally you must be on the watch

347
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:20,047
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

348
00:25:20,189 --> 00:25:25,085
Why does it always go to this sensation?

349
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:32,448
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

350
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:38,274
see the beautiful people, just see them.

351
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,398
Another horrible thing in the West

352
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:44,987
is that the women must expose their body

353
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:47,388
to get men excited.

354
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,446
Men do the same I think.

355
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,215
They always try to excite each other

356
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:55,157
and live in a stupid excitement.

357
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:03,407
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

358
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:06,374
beautiful ornaments.

359
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:11,388
All right? But you're not a thing!

360
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:23,220
It's your private property.

361
00:26:23,753 --> 00:26:28,064
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

362
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:31,312
Better try that, sometimes.

363
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:34,861
You will mind people plundering your gold,

364
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:38,561
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

365
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:42,467
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

366
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,489
You don't feel insulted?

367
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:48,389
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

368
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:52,862
It feels happy that people are watching you.

369
00:26:55,417 --> 00:26:57,250
They are plundering you.

370
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,849
They are looting your chastity.

371
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,044
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

372
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:13,686
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

373
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:20,028
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

374
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:29,519
The minds are very funnily placed,

375
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:33,286
and that's why the greatest complications there are

376
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:36,573
in the brains of people.

377
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:39,879
They are very confused,

378
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:43,589
very confused people.

379
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:47,035
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

380
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:52,208
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

381
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,180
It is actually just the other way round.

382
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,040
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

383
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,303
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

384
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:06,516
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

385
00:28:06,636 --> 00:28:09,075
And why not this property of yours

386
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:10,815
which is the highest of all,

387
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:14,739
to be preserved, to be adorned,

388
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,681
to be worshipped?

389
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:25,034
I'm quite worried on that point

390
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:31,477
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

391
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:33,646
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

392
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,949
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

393
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,612
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

394
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:41,351
but in this matter they think they can go about

395
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,213
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

396
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:48,281
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

397
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:52,569
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

398
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,675
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

399
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:59,383
towards your life, towards your being,

400
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:03,438
towards your personality. You are saints.

401
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:07,175
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

402
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:10,198
I call it the character, the essence of character,

403
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,926
is not a saint.

404
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,057
So this purity has to be maintained.

405
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:23,570
There cannot be any compromise on that.

406
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,662
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

407
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:31,867
If it works out,

408
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:36,613
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

409
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,894
nobody deceives oneself

410
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,464
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

411
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:47,800
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

412
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,440
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

413
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,083
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

414
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:57,466
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

415
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:01,583
your mind can be cleansed.

416
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,786
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

417
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:09,865
“not this, not this, not this.”

418
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:14,842
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

419
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:18,622
I know it's difficult,

420
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:22,989
but if you can get realization why not this also?

421
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,024
You all have to understand

422
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,571
that there is no compromise on this.

423
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:32,579
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

424
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:35,049
you will be thrown away completely,

425
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,549
just like any other devil is thrown out.

426
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,511
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

427
00:30:44,631 --> 00:30:48,151
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

428
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:49,909
You cannot ascend

429
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,000
if there is any lurking thing within you.

430
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,118
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

431
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:01,843
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

432
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:05,957
Only question is “where is your attention?”

433
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:11,380
Divert. Divert your attention.

434
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:18,501
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

435
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:24,883
and afterwards it will come automatically.

436
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:28,654
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

437
00:31:28,774 --> 00:31:31,664
On the contrary,

438
00:31:32,697 --> 00:31:36,769
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

439
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:41,106
So much conditioning is there.

440
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:44,719
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

441
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:47,845
we have ruined ourselves.

442
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:50,574
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

443
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:53,631
and the worst of all.

444
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:57,235
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

445
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,246
unless and until you individually

446
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:03,453
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

447
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:12,353
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

448
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:17,074
and the most powerful chakra.

449
00:32:17,815 --> 00:32:25,632
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

450
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:32,935
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

451
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:35,909
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

452
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:38,969
your wisdom will fail.

453
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,941
You will have no sense of direction.

454
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:49,815
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

455
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,908
before they become forty years of age

456
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:54,569
is because their Mooladharas are out.

457
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:58,112
Most of the diseases which are incurable

458
00:32:58,232 --> 00:33:02,398
come because of weak Mooladharas,

459
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:05,833
on the physical side.

460
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:07,956
On the mental side,

461
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:11,250
most of the mental problems we saw there,

462
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,034
most, I would say ninety percent,

463
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:19,578
are due to weak Mooladhara.

464
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,699
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

465
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:25,881
powerful Mooladhara,

466
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:28,801
it doesn't get into trouble.

467
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:31,839
Because you know there's a very strong hold

468
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:35,524
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

469
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:40,960
And when your mind goes off,

470
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:47,115
you blame the brain.

471
00:33:47,323 --> 00:33:52,550
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

472
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,693
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

473
00:33:56,813 --> 00:34:04,804
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

474
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:10,341
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

475
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:13,547
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

476
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:19,941
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

477
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:26,724
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

478
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:31,455
because the sensationalization

479
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:34,898
has become the main theme of modern life.

480
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:41,517
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

481
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:45,802
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

482
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:53,981
Media, books, ideas, everything,

483
00:34:54,354 --> 00:35:00,334
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

484
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:05,606
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

485
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:10,688
doesn't have any balance.

486
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:13,356
Actually he's hypocritical,

487
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:17,968
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

488
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:21,300
So many complications take place with this.

489
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:25,450
Before realization, forget the past.

490
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,621
Whatever you have done, forget it.

491
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:31,115
Just don't worry.

492
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:33,152
But remember one thing,

493
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:36,041
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

494
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:39,287
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

495
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:41,857
you have to bring it to normalcy.

496
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:47,512
You have to make it a healthy,

497
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:53,835
balanced center,

498
00:35:53,983 --> 00:36:00,144
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

499
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:07,453
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

500
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:12,141
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

501
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,607
We talk of innocence,

502
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:18,444
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

503
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:23,234
we must be on the full watch,

504
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:28,512
on the full alertness about our minds.

505
00:36:28,632 --> 00:36:31,269
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

506
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,612
Where is this thief going?

507
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:36,294
Is he trying to do some tricks?

508
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:39,932
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

509
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:43,882
You have to be alert, very alert.

510
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:48,401
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

511
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,487
But now I have to tell you one thing.

512
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,204
That you'll be exposed.

513
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,994
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

514
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,044
She'll expose you.

515
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:01,021
You'll be exposed

516
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:04,700
if you try to play tricks with Me.

517
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,340
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

518
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,154
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

519
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:12,884
you'll be exposed.

520
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:16,245
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

521
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:21,299
So please be careful, very careful about it,

522
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:27,663
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

523
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:30,800
and powerful.

524
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:34,225
May God bless you!

525
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:44,372
So our prayer should be that

526
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:49,462
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

527
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:53,047
That's all. Let’s pray.

528
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:07,920
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

529
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,133
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

530
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:16,011
Then he will pass it on to you.

531
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:21,772
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

532
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:24,955
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

533
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:29,655
should come and see him every month sometime,

534
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:34,027
and these things should be talked.

535
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,756
Because it's a secret,

536
00:38:39,876 --> 00:38:41,239
not to be discussed openly.

537
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,224
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

538
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,808
It should not be written down anywhere.

539
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,077
It should not be mentioned,

540
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,641
but should be worked out by all of you,

541
00:38:55,761 --> 00:39:01,371
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

542
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:07,076
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

543
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:11,414
Because men suffer much more than women do.

544
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,525
And that's why women must be very careful.

545
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:22,702
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

546
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:34,622
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

547
00:39:34,742 --> 00:39:38,434
men cannot be improved.

548
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:41,770
You have seen in India women don’t like it

549
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,172
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

550
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:45,989
They don't like it.

551
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:49,418
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

552
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:53,942
thousands of them, because they thought some

553
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:58,304
other people may come and touch their body.

554
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:07,205
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

555
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,808
As if it is the body,

556
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:14,169
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

557
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:23,812
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

558
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:27,737
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

559
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:31,660
the power of their chastity.

560
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,992
It's more for ladies here,

561
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:40,259
that they should try to generate that feeling

562
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:43,995
of nobility, of chastity,

563
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:46,796
of holiness around them,

564
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:52,200
so that the men themselves respect them

565
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:56,972
and develop that feeling within themselves.

566
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,904
Thank you very much.
