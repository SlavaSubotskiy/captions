1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:10,410
This was least expected that we'll have a
Puja here or we'll have any program of this

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,410
kind.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:23,989
But I think something was left out of the
whole program of such a fast one as you know

4
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:32,450
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

5
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,690
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:48,110
And I came here in London I learned that there
was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

7
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:59,810
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan
because it is the sister relationship 

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,810
and brother relationship.

9
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:11,960
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna
was born the day his sister was born, and

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:24,370
this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed
I should say, into a lightning later on, but

11
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:34,889
She was the one who announced the existence
of Shri Krishna at that time - that He is

12
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,630
born and He is living, He is in the present.

13
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:45,959
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of
the lightning, and you have seen that whenever

14
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,630
I am going to any place, or I will be giving
a program or something, just before that,

15
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,770
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears
in the sky, you see, to show that announcement.

16
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,750
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

17
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:16,880
To make it more practical and understanding
is that we use electricity now for our televisions,

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,770
for our announcements, for telling people
about messages of something of great importance.

19
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,510
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

20
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:35,220
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement of the coming of Adi

21
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Shakti.

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:44,300
But on the contrary, people start using it
as a pocket kept for our extra ego to be filled.

23
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:55,730
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty
when our sense of relationships are not all

24
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,730
right.

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:07,860
For example, we do not understand a sister
and a brother, the relationship, which is

26
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:19,320
very pure, and is above all kinds of contamination.

27
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,750
But as you know in the West, because maybe
of drinking and doing all kinds of things

28
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,440
which are against awareness, people have lost
the value system, and in that they have also

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,760
lost the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,570
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely
important - because of Her, announcement of

31
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,750
an incarnation takes place.

32
00:03:50,750 --> 00:04:03,950
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

33
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,200
It works it out.

34
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:13,360
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides
in the left Vishuddhi, and I find that Vishnumaya

35
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,110
is the thing that suffers the most, especially
in the West, because it's a fashion to feel

36
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,300
guilty about everything.

37
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:33,690
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing

38
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,490
on this Earth, if you see from a practical
point of view might think it's a wrong thing

39
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:47,200
She has done, because to tell Kamsa that He
exists and He resides, is still existing,

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,920
is giving Him a danger and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

41
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,310
If I had not told, he would not have known."

42
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,810
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

43
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,980
So we have to see for ourselves that what
makes us guilty for small, small things is

44
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:18,500
actually is our own ego reacting against us
and wants us to reconcile with what mistakes

45
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,060
we have committed.

46
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:29,020
Like some people feel guilty because they
have said something they should not have said,

47
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:39,240
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

48
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,440
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

49
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,690
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

50
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,330
They feel guilty.

51
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,080
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

52
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,740
I mean such stupid things like that which
are regarded as norms in the society and people

53
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,750
start thinking that these norms are very,
very important - as if they are something

54
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,310
like a dharma and you must maintain those
norms.

55
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,590
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

56
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,630
You see some of them are so stupid and so
horrifying that I think, in England I feel,

57
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,940
there are some, which must be really completely
squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

58
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,510
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone, because God

59
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,150
knows what kinds of hands people are having,
what kinds of vibrations they have.

60
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,400
Now, when My husband has his reception sometimes
I have to shake hands with seven hundred people

61
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:55,500
coming in, and then seven hundred drunkards
going out.

62
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,740
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

63
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,840
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,
but for others to shake anybody's hand, is

64
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,061
better to do Namaste, though it might be some
a very simple Indian method, but I think is

65
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:20,240
the best way is to say, "Namaste", because
shaking hands can cause lots of problems to

66
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,520
human beings, and now with all these diseases
coming up and all that, I think one has to

67
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,350
be very careful about shaking hands.

68
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,120
Worse than that is in France I find is like
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

69
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,860
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

70
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,050
But they do kiss you all the time if you go
there, I had very bad shocks to begin with,

71
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,010
you see anybody would just get you, kiss you
here, kiss you there, you start looking at

72
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,220
the person.

73
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,610
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

74
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,050
But there is no need to do all, this is not
a very good way of wishing anyone, doesn't

75
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,009
show any respect, in both the cases.

76
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,830
When you shake hands also there's no respect
and even when you kiss somebody there is no

77
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,830
respect.

78
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:16,460
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect, and

79
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,150
this is one thing we have to do is to respect
each other.

80
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,340
But when we are not then we feel guilty, and
like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

81
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,890
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody
then we think we have done a big mistake.

82
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,649
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you
know.

83
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:40,870
We get so much used to it, that even if you
see a statue you say "Thank you very much

84
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,870
for your darshan."

85
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,570
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit
too much.

86
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,070
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service
- or "sorry".

87
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,010
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

88
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,589
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

89
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,649
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

90
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,700
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

91
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,300
fault of the other person.

92
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,830
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

93
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,820
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

94
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,399
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

95
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,240
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

96
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
person.

97
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:42,130
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

98
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,130
matter.

99
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,140
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

100
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,170
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

101
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,920
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

102
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,040
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

103
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,260
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

104
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,520
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

105
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,649
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

106
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,010
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

107
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,959
car to move and the car was moving.

108
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,950
I couldn't understand what was happening.

109
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,220
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

110
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
I said, "What's the matter?"

111
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,410
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

112
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,720
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

113
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,940
you should say "Thank you".

114
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:40,540
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

115
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,490
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

116
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,660
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

117
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:54,940
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

118
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,420
to people for what they have done.

119
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,130
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

120
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,870
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

121
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,690
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

122
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,221
Either you go to the left or to the right.

123
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:18,070
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

124
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,470
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

125
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,240
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

126
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,720
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

127
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,540
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

128
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,730
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

129
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,070
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

130
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,830
Christmas card is not important.

131
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,230
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

132
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,540
Is to wish this person.

133
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,279
Do you have that in your heart?

134
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,430
Did you feel that from your heart?

135
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,240
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

136
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,620
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

137
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,980
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

138
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,339
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

139
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,339
Should have done it.

140
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,959
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

141
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,780
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

142
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:31,300
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

143
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,580
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

144
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,460
have to worry about small, small things.

145
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,589
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

146
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,200
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

147
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
from their aggression.

148
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,930
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

149
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,010
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

150
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,640
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

151
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
I don't want."

152
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,260
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

153
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,580
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

154
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,710
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

155
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,850
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

156
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:30,060
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

157
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,370
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

158
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,529
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

159
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,529
But then he was told about it.

160
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:53,079
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

161
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,290
saint I have a duty to perform.

162
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,700
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

163
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,900
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

164
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:16,870
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

165
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:25,310
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

166
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,890
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

167
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,820
the left Vishuddhi.

168
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:38,230
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

169
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,931
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

170
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:51,019
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

171
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,640
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

172
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,620
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

173
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,130
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

174
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,800
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

175
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,400
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

176
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,839
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

177
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,910
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

178
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,589
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

179
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:50,810
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

180
00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:05,560
So this 
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

181
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:13,019
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

182
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,700
up, face it up and never do it again.

183
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:23,310
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

184
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,160
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

185
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,320
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

186
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,570
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

187
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,740
Another thing is the announcement.

188
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,139
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

189
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,950
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

190
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,740
have to go on telling about it.

191
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
It works!

192
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
It works very well.

193
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,600
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

194
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,360
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

195
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,700
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

196
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:05,839
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

197
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,839
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

198
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,880
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

199
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,600
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

200
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,310
He showed My photograph.

201
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,310
Finished.

202
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,959
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

203
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,390
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

204
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,480
you singing, where are you fixed?"

205
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,760
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

206
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,210
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

207
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,559
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

208
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,280
The fellow was an Englishman.

209
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,429
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

210
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,620
Thik He."

211
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,880
So these things announcement helps a lot.

212
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:05,760
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

213
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,130
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

214
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,670
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

215
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,830
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

216
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,830
people will know.

217
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,220
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

218
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,040
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

219
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
If you like you can wear.

220
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
But there's a freedom to you.

221
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,250
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

222
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,090
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

223
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,900
wear these dresses and go about.

224
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,940
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

225
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,080
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

226
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Why not?

227
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,059
They would like to see you in sarees.

228
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,370
If you want you can wear it.

229
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,530
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

230
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,799
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

231
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,470
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

232
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,410
and those jeans and things like that.

233
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,710
So it doesn't matter.

234
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,990
But then don't feel guilty with it.

235
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,590
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

236
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,490
Be a brave person.

237
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,370
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

238
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,580
Because you are brave you are doing it.

239
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,090
That's the culture that has to come.

240
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,830
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

241
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,710
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

242
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,809
Is it good?

243
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,650
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

244
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,050
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

245
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,330
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

246
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,110
All right, some people can, but not all.

247
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,919
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

248
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,190
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

249
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,580
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

250
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,290
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

251
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,170
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

252
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,860
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

253
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:22,110
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

254
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,110
beings.

255
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,049
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

256
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:29,840
into the state of Virata.

257
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,380
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

258
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,160
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

259
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,050
How can you be guilty?

260
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,860
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

261
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,410
He's the One.

262
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,860
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

263
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,910
You don't blame your hand for it.

264
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,710
What you blame is the body.

265
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,910
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

266
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,710
The body takes over.

267
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,120
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

268
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,650
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

269
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,950
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

270
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:15,140
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

271
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,049
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

272
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:21,360
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

273
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,900
It has no place.

274
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,440
It has no place.

275
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,870
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

276
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,190
What's the logic?

277
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,800
You cannot feel guilty.

278
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,940
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

279
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,760
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

280
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,710
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

281
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,450
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

282
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,520
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

283
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

284
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:03,030
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

285
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,030
No!

286
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,630
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

287
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:21,500
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

288
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,690
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

289
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,520
The collectivity part of it.

290
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,799
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

291
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,809
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

292
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:45,840
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

293
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,250
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

294
00:22:51,250 --> 00:23:00,090
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

295
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,870
into thin air.

296
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:07,610
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

297
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,250
God knows where it has gone.

298
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:18,620
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

299
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,440
what it is.

300
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:28,420
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

301
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:35,720
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

302
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,420
Herself, shines and announces.

303
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,640
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

304
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
it?

305
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
We are saints.

306
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,720
Of course we are.

307
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,880
"Are you saints??"

308
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,040
"Yes, we are."

309
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,590
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

310
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,380
to feel shy about it.

311
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,530
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

312
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,880
But here we dare not have any procession.

313
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,240
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

314
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
a procession.

315
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,860
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

316
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:19,190
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

317
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,000
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

318
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,440
to announce, then you are.

319
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,130
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

320
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,470
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

321
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,470
about it.

322
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,380
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

323
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,990
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

324
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,330
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

325
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,910
guilty about everything.

326
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,150
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

327
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,510
That's the trouble.

328
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,080
Think of it positively.

329
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,770
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

330
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,230
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

331
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,030
have gone further."

332
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,770
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

333
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:29,150
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

334
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,150
destiny?

335
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,150
What have you to become?

336
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:38,390
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

337
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,929
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

338
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:48,741
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

339
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:55,880
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

340
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,039
can create so many things - it's true.

341
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,289
But, that is not your destiny.

342
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:06,419
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

343
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,970
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

344
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,630
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

345
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,900
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

346
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,409
only a few people were there putting the posters.

347
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:33,850
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

348
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,000
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

349
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,309
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

350
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:45,990
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

351
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,539
my, my, my, my that, my that."

352
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,330
So they live in an island.

353
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,700
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

354
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,870
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

355
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,090
Then they feel guilty.

356
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,890
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

357
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:17,270
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

358
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,980
of the whole of humanity.

359
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:26,659
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

360
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:34,360
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

361
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
way.

362
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,250
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

363
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:46,919
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

364
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,039
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

365
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,740
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

366
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,520
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

367
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,640
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

368
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,090
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

369
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,530
They don't have to possess anyone.

370
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:16,680
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

371
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,460
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

372
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:27,280
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

373
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:35,059
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

374
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,059
parcel of the whole.

375
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:41,380
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

376
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,580
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

377
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,830
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

378
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,940
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

379
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,679
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

380
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,520
We are all one.

381
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,440
So what is there to say sorry?

382
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,180
There is no foreigner within us.

383
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:15,580
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

384
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,580
or anything.

385
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:23,000
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

386
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,590
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

387
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:32,450
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

388
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,870
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

389
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,289
They are part and parcel of My being.

390
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:41,030
So why should I send this to them?

391
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,480
But I can nourish them.

392
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,679
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

393
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,970
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

394
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,870
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

395
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,210
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

396
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,210
Think about it.

397
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,289
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

398
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,590
It is sometimes so.

399
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:19,370
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

400
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:25,070
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

401
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,980
they started the song.

402
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,630
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

403
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,000
that I like this song."

404
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,830
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

405
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,880
also pleasing other people.

406
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,890
The example of that is like this.

407
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,800
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

408
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,976
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

409
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:57,820
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

410
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,100
mozzarella cheese.

411
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,580
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

412
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,909
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

413
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,790
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

414
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,580
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

415
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
"Eh, you have a choice?"

416
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,470
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

417
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,059
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

418
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,480
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

419
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:36,480
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

420
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,059
So this kind of understanding shows what?

421
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:45,510
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

422
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,360
You have not seen Me.

423
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,890
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

424
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,950
mozzarella, mozzarella.

425
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:01,830
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

426
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,980
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

427
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:13,320
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

428
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
no choice of anything.

429
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,260
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

430
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,179
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

431
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:26,539
I don't make fuss about things.

432
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:33,620
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

433
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,169
that they are not collective.

434
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,340
Collective is to understand Me fully.

435
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,929
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

436
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,200
They all know about it.

437
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,190
They know about the whole body.

438
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,559
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

439
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,710
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

440
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,429
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

441
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:05,090
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

442
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,059
thousand names of the Goddess.

443
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:13,250
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

444
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:18,320
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

445
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,590
She can finish people.

446
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,530
She's absolutely wrathful.

447
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,450
It's true, I accept, it is so.

448
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,350
But it is so, so it is so.

449
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,320
But you must understand My in full ways.

450
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,720
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

451
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,370
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

452
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,169
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

453
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:56,390
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

454
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,820
So the other side will definitely punish you.

455
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:07,830
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

456
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,909
understood properly.

457
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,819
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

458
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:17,810
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

459
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,739
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

460
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,269
Try to understand the essence of everything.

461
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:30,609
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

462
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:33,799
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

463
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:43,929
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

464
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,239
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

465
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,780
We don't have to judge it mentally.

466
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,479
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

467
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,479
What is the need?

468
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,099
Ten minutes is sufficient.

469
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,799
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

470
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:05,739
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

471
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:11,440
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

472
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,609
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

473
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:21,430
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

474
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,680
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

475
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,130
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

476
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:32,759
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

477
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:40,089
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

478
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:43,019
maximum love.

479
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:46,589
So many there are ways of handling things.

480
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:53,920
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

481
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,549
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

482
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:03,799
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

483
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:06,579
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

484
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:13,150
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

485
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:20,210
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

486
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:26,880
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

487
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,140
You are not facing it.

488
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,490
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

489
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,380
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

490
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,900
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

491
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:51,230
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

492
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,069
Because that is the essence.

493
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:59,150
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

494
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,200
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

495
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,670
mantras, they are not effective.

496
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:16,109
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

497
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,450
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

498
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:24,450
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

499
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:54,369
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

500
00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:01,619
It has the full effect.

501
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:12,170
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

502
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:19,180
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

503
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
bad.

504
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,089
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

505
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:24,109
You will do it.

506
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:26,640
You will hurt others.

507
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
You will torture others.

508
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
You will take advantage of them.

509
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,509
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

510
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:36,380
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

511
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,680
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

512
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,359
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

513
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,420
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

514
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:04,709
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

515
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,670
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

516
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,700
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

517
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,130
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

518
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,099
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

519
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,099
come and correct the sister.

520
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,079
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

521
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,680
relationship that you could think of.

522
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,539
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

523
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,959
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

524
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:48,869
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

525
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,309
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

526
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:58,299
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

527
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:04,609
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

528
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:06,249
it as a guilt.

529
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:09,290
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

530
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:15,119
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

531
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,190
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

532
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:26,670
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

533
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:37,470
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

534
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:44,589
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

535
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:49,999
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

536
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:58,799
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

537
00:40:58,799 --> 00:40:59,799
pleasure.

538
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:05,260
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

539
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,319
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

540
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:10,469
sister, doesn't matter.

541
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:17,039
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

542
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,940
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

543
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,309
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

544
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,040
the sisters.

545
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,289
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

546
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:37,029
open - there should be no formality in it.

547
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:40,619
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

548
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:46,529
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

549
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:47,529
But it can be the other way around.

550
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:53,079
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

551
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,849
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

552
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:57,989
So what?

553
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,890
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

554
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,949
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

555
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:05,949
Finished.

556
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:07,199
That's broken long time back.

557
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,759
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

558
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:15,410
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

559
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,400
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

560
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,819
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

561
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:36,520
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

562
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,900
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

563
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,729
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

564
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:47,249
That's why the discretion stands in between.

565
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:51,299
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

566
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:52,949
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

567
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:55,199
That discretion is in between.

568
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:02,319
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

569
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:08,549
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

570
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:13,199
Other than that it doesn't exist.

571
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,589
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

572
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:27,489
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

573
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:35,329
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

574
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:37,770
May God Bless you!

575
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:41,809
Now for a puja, we should have a very simple
puja.

576
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:45,630
Actually, I was saying there's no need to
give Me a saree because I am not anybody's

577
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,160
sister or a brother.

578
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,049
But Rakhi day, My brother is here.

579
00:43:54,049 --> 00:44:00,099
It's nice that we can have it in a way My
physical brother is here.

580
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:07,119
It's very good we are having a rakhi program
today in his presence.

581
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:17,700
And, all of you should also understand that
it's a very subtle, pure, beautiful relationship

582
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,339
that exists between a brother and a sister.
