1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,150
It was really very enjoyable today, to see
all of you, in such a happy mood. What happiness

2
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,340
what joy Sahaja Yoga has brought to all of
you. It’s really, I could never have imagined,

3
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,369
that people could be that joyous and, that
relaxed, as you were this evening. Also it

4
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,450
shows, how much you have understood, the stupidity
of this hypocrisy going on in the Name of

5
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,390
God. Not only that, that you have understood,
but, the way you have depicted it, showed

6
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:10,130
also your great, art of acting, art of bringing
out the salient points of all this hypocrisy.

7
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:22,220
There are many people who can see this point,
not that only we see, many people must be

8
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:31,870
knowing about it also, but you have the power
now, to, accept it, understand it, and realize

9
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,060
it, as the truth, that they are really hypocrites.
We have human beings, who of course, do not

10
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,299
want to accept, do not want to see. They have
closed their eyes, blind faith in all those

11
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,299
hypocritical people, somehow or other, they
lack reasoning, understanding, logic. But

12
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,930
there are some who understand, who have this,
full image of these people in different countries,

13
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,290
in different, religions and all these guru
people. They understand it. But still, they

14
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:44,269
cannot, go against it, they dare not say anything
against it, and even if they say, it will

15
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,989
be in a very, hush-hush manner, not so openly
as we did it today. Though it was very hilarious,

16
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:10,139
and very enjoyable, but behind all this comedy
I felt the tragedy, because, there are so

17
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:22,889
many, who are suffering, who are being looted,
who are being cheated, who are being used,

18
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,840
morally who have been crushed.
And I don’t know how many, cruel things

19
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:56,469
are going behind the scene in the Name of
God. Such a tragedy that, is still going on

20
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:07,589
in these modern times. But you are all very
lucky and fortunate people, that you have

21
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:14,819
dropped all this nonsense, all the shackles
of blind faith and now, you are all enjoying

22
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,570
the freedom of your Spirit. It’s something
I enjoyed the most. You have to understand,

23
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,500
that we are now in the Kingdom of God, so
we can see the reality, very clearly, and

24
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,520
in the Kingdom of the God we are looked after,
all the time by the Divine Power. How it works

25
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:57,199
out, how it looks after us, is extremely remarkable.
As you saw one drama, the one after all these

26
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,120
actors coming on the stage, we actually, saw
ourselves a drama in India, without organizing,

27
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,360
very spontaneous, just like it was today,
but without any organization, a beautiful

28
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:32,099
drama we saw which I must tell you, so that
you will understand how much this Divine Power

29
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:39,539
is working it out.
You remember we had a very bad time in Angapur

30
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:47,189
when these people threw stones and so many
were hurt, if you remember that night, and

31
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:54,569
we were in trouble. And we had filed a case,
but the case was not somehow or other started,

32
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,270
and it was the date, something, where I could
not be there, but still the case was there

33
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:12,439
and we didn’t know what was happening. There
was one man who had come when we were having

34
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:19,439
this program. His name was Anant Beransbe
and he told Me that he’s from the television

35
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,000
and he wants to have his Realization. So I
said: ‘I cannot just now I have to speak,

36
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
so you can go on the back side and sit down
and we’ll see if we can manage your Realization.’

37
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,860
When these people, you heard the story, that
it was they who had arranged this man from

38
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:48,599
television to come, those who had been throwing
stones at us, these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar

39
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,800
molan] people. And we didn’t know what to
do, so, a son-in-law of our Home Minister,

40
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:09,199
came to My house in Pradisthan and asked for
Realization. I was quite surprised this man

41
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:17,599
coming down for Realization. And then I told
him what is happening to us. He said: ‘No

42
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,259
no you can go and see this Home Minister.
‘ Now this Home Minister is a great disciple

43
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:30,099
of our asatya Baba, imagine. I said: ‘It’s
really; I don’t know how it will work out

44
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:37,099
this stupid fellow, this disciple of asatya
Sai Baba.

45
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:44,379
So just see the drama. He was quite hesitant,
and with Me Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan and

46
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:56,020
one Nirvika who is from the same area as this
Minister who had arranged this meeting. So

47
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,340
we went there. So the private secretary had
a great respect for Me, so he called the car

48
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,110
inside, we couldn’t understand. Then he
came and touched My Feet. I was quite surprised.

49
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:18,110
Then I went and sat with this Home Minister,
and his wife came in and she touched My Feet.

50
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:25,330
I was quite surprised, and she said: ‘You
don’t remember me?’ I said: ‘I think

51
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,979
I’ve seen you somewhere.’ She said: ‘You’ve
forgotten we had gone together to London.’

52
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:35,979
There was a, offer from Air India for people
who have been doing social work, as a sort

53
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,770
of a reward that we could go to England and
come back. So there were quite a lot of ladies

54
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:51,770
who went and the Chief Minister’s wife also
came and she was, actually he’s Chief Minister

55
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,370
at that time and she’s his wife. They were
very well known to My family. Actually their

56
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,370
marriage was arranged by My father also.
So they were, all sort of, they were new this

57
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,210
western culture, very old-fashioned ladies,
all old ladies you see, traveling with Me

58
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,430
to London. There you see they were so shocked
at the dance they saw and everything, they

59
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,810
said: ‘What are these dirty people doing
here? Why are they showing us these dirty

60
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,220
things, and we are not dirty women.’ And
like that you see they were. I had to tell

61
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,250
them all right: ‘They have this kind of
dances only. If you don’t want to see we

62
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,030
can go out.’ Went out and all of them started
vomiting there. So it was such a bad condition

63
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,410
with them. So they stuck on to Me in London,
all of them, and one of them was the wife

64
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:48,410
of this gentleman, and she said: ‘That if
You remember we all stuck on to You.’

65
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,070
They were all older than Me, because they
couldn’t understand what’s happening in

66
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,480
these countries because they had never seen
such dances, such women, such men. She said:

67
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,920
‘But why are these Air India people troubling
us like this? Why do they want to shock us?’

68
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,290
I said: ‘It’s all right. That is their
entertainment style doesn’t matter and all.’

69
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,070
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned women have come

70
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,980
here and they can’t stand all this nonsense.
But this lady said that: ‘See how You supported

71
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,580
us, how You helped us, otherwise we are all
collapsing you see there.’

72
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,950
So this lady was very sweet and then she started
telling her husband: ‘You know She was quite

73
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,220
young but She was very wise and She looked
after us, and She did this and She was the

74
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,320
youngest and all.’ Then suddenly one girl,
now one by one on the stage, first of all

75
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,660
the wife came in, then they announced: ‘There’s
a lady called Nirmala Deshbande who wants

76
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,290
to meet her. So they said: ‘No no just now
I’m talking to Shri Mataji. I’ll see her

77
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,470
later.’ ‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her,
she knows Me very well.’ So this Nirmala

78
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,940
Deshbande was with Me in 1942 Movement – imagine
the drama. She should come that day only,

79
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:08,940
in the morning time.
Actually the whole, I mean our, interview

80
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,480
was fixed for the previous evening but it
was postponed for next morning and next morning

81
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,040
one by one how these people are coming on
the stage. First his wife, and we are already

82
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:29,040
given a nice ulta bandhan, the other way round,
to this two photographs of Mr Narakasura,

83
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:36,410
lest he starts pouring some pribhooties from
his photographs.

84
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:42,790
Then this lady this Nirmala Deshbande she
came. As soon as she saw Me she just fell

85
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,530
at My Feet, she started hugging Me. She said:
‘How long we have… are meeting now this

86
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,130
that.’ She even forgot the Home Minister
was sitting there, nothing of the kind, and

87
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,140
they all started looking at her. ‘Oh you
don’t know her? She was our Leader, you

88
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,240
see She was like a real Shakti how She faced
the Britishers you have no idea. You people

89
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,730
have become Ministers but this is the Lady
who fought for the freedom.’ And all she

90
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,730
gave a big lecture to the Home Minister and
Home Minister – like this.

91
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:29,260
But this is not the end. Then, she wouldn’t
talk to him. She was just talking to Me and

92
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,770
she said: ‘Oh You have been doing great
work. I have heard about You. I’ve been

93
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,220
longing to meet You, but just imagine, today
I’ve come and You are here after such a

94
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,880
long time. Oh you don’t know what a loving
Lady She is. She was so sweet to us. She was

95
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,380
much younger to me in age and we were so many
girls you see, boys, all of them She organized

96
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,890
and She was so young and still She was so
brave.’ And she was describing everything.

97
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,690
I was quite embarrassed. So the Minister didn’t
know why she had come there, then.

98
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,790
Then I said: ‘All right now I’m going.
I told him the whole story, gave him all the

99
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,280
papers and he couldn’t help it, he had to
sign all right: ‘Please do something about

100
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,880
it or something’. He wrote to the main man
in Maharashtra. I told him about all these

101
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,110
and how Rajneesh has planned this, and all
this was done by Rajneesh people, because

102
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:30,110
we have proof of that. Then we came out. We
came out and there was one lady who again

103
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,150
touched My Feet, in the verandah. I couldn’t
recognize her very well. She said: ‘Have

104
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:44,150
You forgotten? I’m the Maharani of Satara’,
where this incident had taken – you know

105
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Angapur is close to Satara. ‘Ah I remember.’
‘You came in 1972. We had a nice meeting

106
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,200
in our palace and my mother-in-law the Rajmata
invited You, she washed Your Feet.’ I said:

107
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,240
‘Yes yes I remember.’ ‘But You forgot
us. You never met us after that. Now You have

108
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,620
to come to the wedding of my son. I’ve come
to invite the Home Minister. You have to come

109
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,150
to the wedding of my son.’ I said: ‘I’m
going away tomorrow to Rome.’ She said:

110
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:20,150
‘No no no I’ll take You. I’ll do this.
So all right, at least You must ask this Home

111
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,130
Minister to come. He’ll listen to You, I’m
sure he’ll listen to You.’ I just kept

112
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,550
quiet.
So, then you see there was a gentleman standing

113
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:38,550
with her. So she went inside. He said: ‘Shri
Mataji,’ he touched My Feet, ‘I’ve met

114
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,540
You before, and You have given me Realization.’
I said: ‘What’s your name?’ He said:

115
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,540
‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’ I said: ‘What?’
‘I met You in Angapur. I’m Anant Beransbe.

116
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,530
I was there. You remember?’ I said: ‘Yes
of course. Why did you come to Angapur?’

117
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,300
He said: ‘Only a Sahaja Yoga brought me
there.’ ‘But you were not brought by the

118
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,200
[Sounds Like: andar sadar]?’ He said: ‘No
never, why would I come with these horrible

119
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,410
people?’ ‘So what happened?’
He said: ‘Only four days back I was in Satara

120
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:18,410
and the case started and they had taken me
there. So I told them that, I saw seven people

121
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,500
being hit by these [SOUNDS LIKE: andar sadar]
people. And they were all bleeding. And I

122
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,500
was so upset with it that I couldn’t bear
it. I ran away from there. But one thing I

123
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,040
must say: ‘Mataji was telling everybody:
‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter, doesn’t

124
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,680
matter. Some stones are coming. Just keep
quiet. Don’t throw any stones. Don’t do

125
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,310
anything.’ He told there in the Court. Can
you imagine this fellow, in our absence? And

126
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,640
after one year I met him and then they started
saying: ‘Oh Mataji must have given him laques

127
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,910
of rupees that’s why he’s talking like
this.’ They thought he was their witness,

128
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:03,910
just imagine. I said: ‘Really?’ Immediately
I told that private secretary: ‘Bring our

129
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,530
petition.’ And we cut out all that was written
against this Anant Beransbe, otherwise he

130
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:18,120
would have been in trouble. Imagine. And then
said: ‘Really?’

131
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,500
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why don’t
You come in and tell the Home Minister to

132
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,190
come to attend my son’s wedding? At least
he should do Mother.’ So I went with her

133
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,940
and this fellow also came Anant Beransbe and
I said: ‘This is that same fellow Anant

134
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,500
Beransbe, but he’s telling something else.
And then he started telling them, how they

135
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,590
hit and how they were this thing. He said
this Dr [SOUNDS LIKE: Tabuker?] he’s a devil.

136
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,240
And all we had written against him in that,
imagine. Can you imagine such a story? This

137
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,240
fellow, this Anant Beransbe, who was mentioned
in that petition of ours, should be there

138
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,840
on that morning there standing, waiting for
Me. Then he asked him two-three questions,

139
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,150
the Home Minister: ‘What are they doing?’
‘Nothing. They were hitting one after another

140
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,939
seven people I saw and I got such a fright
I ran away with my camera, couldn’t bear

141
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,430
it and Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t
hit, don’t hit’. She was so quiet.’

142
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,130
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

143
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,890
So went we came out, despite that he was a
disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

144
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,970
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me, then Nirmala Deshbande comes

145
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,110
in, then this Maharani comes in, and then
after that, and the Maharani herself praising

146
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:47,110
Me a lot, that I cured her mother-in-law and
all. And then comes in Mr, this Anant Beransbe,

147
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,720
and he told them the whole story, and this
Home Minister didn’t know where to look.

148
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,550
Asatya Sai Baba and whole thing was finished
into nowhere. So see how the drama worked,

149
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,910
and we were so amazed at the whole thing.
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother it

150
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,910
was Mahasahaja Yoga.’
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out. You

151
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,870
must know that it all works out. But you must
also know that you must have faith in paramachaitanya.

152
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,770
Also faith in yourself that you are in the
Kingdom of God. I was very happy today the

153
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:46,770
way you enjoyed all that and understood it
but, one thing is there, that you all should,

154
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,040
not that only enjoy this but feel it, as a
responsibility. We have to, point it out to

155
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:06,210
the whole world, how hypocritical they are,
how they are using the name of God, and how

156
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,710
they are ruining people, by their, tricks.
So today I don’t want to tell you lots of

157
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:27,630
things. Today is a day still the Christ has
not Risen as they say but I don’t know at

158
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,960
this time, He must have come out of His grave
already, as it is because, He came out and

159
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:46,550
He was standing outside when His Mother came
and asked Him: ‘Who are You?’ She couldn’t

160
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:55,060
even Recognize Him. She couldn’t even believe
that Christ has Risen. In the same way we

161
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,220
also forget that we have Risen and that we
are completely transformed, and we are free,

162
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:08,220
absolutely free people. Nothing can dominate
us, none of our conditionings, none of our

163
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:19,390
ego, nothing can dominate us, none of our
habits. Everything has died out and we are

164
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:27,059
free birds to fly and to enjoy our flights.
This is what we have to realize. May God bless

165
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,640
you.
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t

166
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,059
give Me any prizes, nothing. It’s too much.
It is too much of presentations. I mean I

167
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,760
don’t know why you are giving Me all these
things all the time, but you think that, that’s

168
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,760
only your privilege that so you have to do
it. So I have to have certain privileges,

169
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:02,970
I can also give you presents. So I have bought
some very small ones for all of you, those

170
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:09,970
who are here in Rome. For Cabella people I
bought last time, but I’ll also do it when

171
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,270
they come there. And for other countries also
I’ll be giving them whenever I go there

172
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:23,270
but just now it is for the people of Rome
and the leaders. Leaders, I’m also afraid

173
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,010
of them, because sometimes you see, if they
get angry they can form a union against Me

174
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:36,010
you know. So One has to be careful with them.
So there’s little presents for all of them

175
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,470
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…
