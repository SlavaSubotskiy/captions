1
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,120
Today is a great day for all of us,

2
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,130
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

3
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,850
That in sixteen beats

4
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,610
or sixteen movements

5
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,550
you reach a higher position in the poem.

6
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,690
That it is complete,

7
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,220
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

8
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,630
because He has sixteen petals.

9
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,950
This completeness is called "s "purna."

10
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,300
So, now we move into another dimension.

11
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:58,590
The first one was where you got your Self Realization.

12
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,960
In the evolutionary process,

13
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,130
if you see, the animals are not conscious

14
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,380
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

15
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,550
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

16
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,630
for their own purpose.

17
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,260
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

18
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,070
If you show a mirror to animals

19
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,670
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

20
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,780
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

21
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,840
That means that we are rather close to them!

22
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,520
So, when we have become human beings,

23
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,360
we became aware in our consciousness

24
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,960
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

25
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,390
So, in their brain they did not understand

26
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,170
that they could put matter into their own use.

27
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,350
As human beings you were all unaware

28
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,960
of the chakras that existed within you.

29
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,550
So your consciousness still was working

30
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,310
halfway through unconscious

31
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:03,250
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

32
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,920
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

33
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,720
or your inner organs, how they're working.

34
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,480
You did not even feel how

35
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,810
you are getting affected by other influences.

36
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,180
As a result of that,

37
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,670
with the freedom that human beings achieved

38
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,160
or were granted,

39
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,380
they gathered all kinds of things

40
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,070
into their brains, into their Sahasrara,

41
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,240
without being aware of it.

42
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,450
They used their Sahasrara, their brain

43
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:56,230
for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless.

44
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,180
They were not aware, again,

45
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,020
of the warning that Shri Krishna had given

46
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,860
that if you use human awareness except for your ascent,

47
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,260
you will go downward.

48
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,730
They were told. Not that they were not told.

49
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,770
They knew about it.

50
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,660
Whether it was East or West, everybody knew

51
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,620
that you have to be born again.

52
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,120
And it so happened that in the West

53
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,660
people thought that by using their brainpower

54
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,400
they can now master the matter;

55
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,970
that they can use matter for their own purpose.

56
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,700
If they had done it after their Self Realization,

57
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,760
it would have been a very different situation,

58
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,400
because after Self Realization

59
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,130
you all have become aware of vibrations,

60
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,870
which is chaitanya, and also of your chakras.

61
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,300
With this new awareness,

62
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,110
you would have avoided all that was wrong.

63
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,790
But it is like a greedy person,

64
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,980
who gets a wee bit of money and he spends it off.

65
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,740
Now this problem has complicated your brains.

66
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:22,940
You have certain concepts, which
are very much away from reality.

67
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,210
The way we have started using machines,

68
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,330
we have become machines ourselves.

69
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,620
So we have no feelings and we cannot relate

70
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,070
to others in a natural way.

71
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,050
In human awareness you had achieved

72
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,810
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

73
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,640
But this ego-oriented approach

74
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:36,770
took you away from natural, real life.

75
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,780
And we became artificial.

76
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:59,610
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

77
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:17,470
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

78
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,960
This is just the opposite of your ascent

79
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,950
and evolutionary process

80
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,580
because you have lost the power to relate to others,

81
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,670
which you had gained as human beings.

82
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,370
All the organizations which you have formed

83
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:06,240
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

84
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,940
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

85
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,550
That is another copying of the artificial.

86
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,030
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

87
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,100
Natural is to evolve.

88
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,500
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

89
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,680
So the another concept also that you accepted very easily

90
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,960
because you have got brains

91
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,740
and you accept everything that comes your way.

92
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,710
And you became so artificial that you needed all the time

93
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,720
some sensations to feel yourself.

94
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,460
Now in every walk of life

95
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:57,680
there is a conceptual, artificial understanding.

96
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,050
For example you see the sex,

97
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,730
which is such a natural, normal thing.

98
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,600
There is nothing so great about it. s

99
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,460
But that also you made so artificial

100
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,670
that you have now your sex in your brain.

101
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,250
By that not only you have silenced Ganesha in the Mooladhara,

102
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,450
but also Mahaganesha in your brain.

103
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,280
In another aspect, say art.

104
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,720
Now the concept is so stupid

105
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:20,750
that it says that art should be according to what is laid down.

106
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,820
Whatever is laid down about art,

107
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,240
that art should be such, such, such.

108
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Like you will call somebody as baroque, condemn it,

109
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,110
then rococo, this, that. Condemn everyone.

110
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,670
And ultimately you reach a conclusion

111
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,970
that the most insipid thing is art.

112
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,950
As if, like the sugarcane, when
you have taken out all the juice,

113
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,290
whatever remains will become art one day.

114
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,840
So the brain, which does not nourish the heart

115
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:42,430
is absolutely an artificial brain, just like a robot.

116
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,980
So people have become just like robots.

117
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,230
Now this can be handled by anyone

118
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,790
who has a mastermind.

119
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,610
Because you don't have your own heart

120
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,720
and the brain is controlled by somebody

121
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,660
who has a greater brain of concepts.

122
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,820
All these concepts are destructive.

123
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,960
Say Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan

124
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,370
and he is of the superior race.

125
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,670
And to establish that, he did not mind

126
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,030
destroying the whole world.

127
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,170
Same is the case in the religion field.

128
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:49,270
There also, every religion was put

129
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,590
or poured into the cups of concepts.

130
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,090
Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved,

131
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,500
is that money is everything.

132
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,190
First they tried for political domination,

133
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:35,090
thinking that political domination is everything.

134
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:46,490
And now they feel that money is everything

135
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,730
and all other sublime things are imaginary.

136
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:18,350
So, when I started My life,

137
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,180
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

138
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:40,070
And the more I tried to solve the complications

139
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,530
within My own awareness,

140
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,360
the more it became more difficult.

141
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:13,470
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

142
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:21,000
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

143
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,030
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

144
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,390
within these sixteen years

145
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:46,420
I found that they are now incorrigible.

146
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,150
Now the stage for you is laid down

147
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,570
to ascend higher.

148
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:31,180
This is the background which I have described to you.

149
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,740
And you can see how, when you have a program,

150
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,930
there will be 500 people for the program

151
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,690
and within two weeks all will disappear.

152
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,610
Because when the ascent takes place,

153
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,060
the Kundalini pushes out the ego

154
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,590
and brings the person close to reality.

155
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:26,210
But again that ego, which is being built up so fast

156
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,950
in its speed, overpowers the speed

157
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,330
of the Kundalini and covers the head.

158
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:01,360
Then it suggests that, "how can you have godly life?"

159
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,700
You will miss all the alcohol, all the madness,

160
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,030
all the fun of life.

161
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,480
That they feel, they will loose all the freedom to become mad.

162
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,020
When you see from this position

163
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,140
the way people react, it is amazing.

164
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,750
You have to do something extremely stupid

165
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,120
to sell it in the market.

166
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:08,820
The other day I heard that somebody has become rich

167
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:17,800
selling the empty tins as lamps.

168
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,500
All kinds of stupid things,

169
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:36,370
which are nowhere near natural beauty

170
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:42,890
or natural joy, are accepted as sophisticated.

171
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,830
The other side of it is that the asuri vidya,

172
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,040
the black vidya has taken over.

173
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,450
As Shri Krishna again had warned that,

174
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:31,710
in the fifteenth chapter, that if asuri vidya takes over,

175
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,930
then the suddha vidya cannot compete

176
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,150
with the speed of asuri vidya.

177
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,820
Like in America there has been a big

178
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,020
argument amongst Sahaja Yogis

179
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,780
if My photograph should be in the drawing room or not.

180
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,300
But if you ask them to paint their nails black,

181
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,500
their faces black and black clothes
like witches, they will do it.

182
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,260
That even at the stage when we are Sahaja Yogis,

183
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:49,340
we are shy of our godly life.

184
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,020
When they became hippies or when they became punks

185
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,700
or they became anything like that stupid,

186
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,150
they gave all their life,

187
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,670
all their time, all their money to it.

188
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,270
They changed their dresses, they changed their lifestyles,

189
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:24,170
they changed their family life,
everything they changed, went all out.

190
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,540
I mean, and even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about

191
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:39,820
the godliness of Sahaja Yoga, still they are shy.

192
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,640
Now you know your Mother doesn't take any money from you,

193
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,960
on the contrary She spends, you all have gained out of it.

194
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:00,320
But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy.

195
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:27,750
From that background you are coming
to the light of God's Grace.

196
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,080
But you don't want to dash at it,

197
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,690
you want to take your time, gradually,

198
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:50,330
so gradually that maybe you may lose your chance.

199
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,570
So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis

200
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,060
where you know all about your chakras,

201
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,930
you know about vibrations, you
know how you relate to others,

202
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:20,900
still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

203
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,210
So, the shadow of the past still lingers on,

204
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,990
even when you have this new awareness.

205
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,500
Animals can swim automatically,

206
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,460
they don't have to learn.

207
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,540
But human beings have to learn to swim.

208
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,490
So they had forgotten the techniques
which were known to the animals

209
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,580
and have taken to the techniques of human beings.

210
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,590
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got

211
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,630
your Realization in one lifetime.

212
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,990
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

213
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,540
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

214
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,820
So the time is so very short!

215
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,220
And the background is so dark.

216
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,500
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

217
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,260
morning till evening destructive concepts.

218
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,040
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

219
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,650
much faster than all of them.

220
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:28,640
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

221
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,690
that your awareness is very different from them,

222
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,510
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

223
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,660
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:04,420
Every one of you must think every day:

225
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,420
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

226
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,490
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

227
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,290
of making money, of have relations with people

228
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,120
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

229
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,530
We have to make an all out effort

230
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:50,530
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,

231
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,550
we believe in, we act on that a

232
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,080
nd become one with it.

233
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,900
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

234
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:23,470
this is the problem, I mean ... I will explain this point.

235
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:36,110
Like supposing a fanatic believes

236
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,640
that he can do such and such thing

237
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,020
in his own religion, he will do it.

238
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,560
When the concept is not reality,

239
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,780
it has given no benefit to anyone,

240
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:15,630
has shown no performance of any substance

241
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,570
still people do it.

242
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,900
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

243
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,860
My father himself gave up all his property,

244
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:50,220
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

245
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:55,140
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

246
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,400
for days together, for years together.

247
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,010
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

248
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,340
but for the subtler freedom

249
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:31,310
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

250
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,470
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

251
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:56,200
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

252
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,940
You are the ones who are very much higher

253
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:16,730
than the rest of the humanity.

254
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:30,360
That the salvation of the whole of humanity depends on you.

255
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,670
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

256
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,670
So, first of all you have to be conscious

257
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:54,210
in your consciousness that you are so important,

258
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,600
and that's why you were given Realization.

259
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,670
How can you be living with your conditionings

260
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,080
and with your ego?

261
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,830
The conditionings are like this:

262
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,850
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

263
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,060
then you must bring that

264
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,140
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

265
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,230
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

266
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,350
you want to bring some out of that.

267
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:50,380
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

268
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,940
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

269
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:14,460
All these things are like dirt over

270
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,180
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

271
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,050
Though now you are aware,

272
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,140
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

273
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,890
you do not keep them clean.

274
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,980
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

275
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,900
they have houses, they try to keep them clean.

276
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:08,160
But you do not feel ashamed of them

277
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,530
also when they are bad,

278
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,290
because after some time

279
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,910
you also loose the awareness of them.

280
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:32,300
That means you have become subtler,

281
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:39,060
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

282
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,980
There are so many things you know more

283
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:04,210
than the people who are not realized,

284
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:08,350
as absolute reality.

285
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:23,480
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

286
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,150
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

287
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,160
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

288
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,570
we start giving bandhans.

289
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,440
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

290
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,370
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

291
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,040
otherwise, in your central nervous system

292
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,820
you are not yet so conscious.

293
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,960
This is the reason, why you do not know

294
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:33,830
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

295
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,130
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

296
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,700
you cannot go further.

297
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,590
For example, I know everything what I do.

298
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,250
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

299
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,380
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

300
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:35,450
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

301
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,370
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

302
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,880
I know about everyone of you.

303
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,280
I may not know your worldly names,

304
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:04,690
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

305
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:20,180
I also can behave like a human being,

306
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:27,040
absolutely like you, aging like you,

307
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,080
even using spectacles,

308
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:42,100
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

309
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,510
I have accepted this role consciously,

310
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,890
not unconsciously.

311
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:59,510
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

312
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:06,920
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

313
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,960
you have to be alert about it.

314
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,880
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

315
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,030
the peace.

316
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,430
But even now I find that peace

317
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,090
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

318
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,530
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

319
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,540
It is a homogenous thing.

320
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,910
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

321
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,650
We are unconscious about our fingers,

322
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,750
but when we have to hold something,

323
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,310
all of them come together and work it out.

324
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:39,120
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

325
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,330
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

326
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,370
That is what evolution is.

327
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:19,520
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

328
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:35,900
You must learn to face the reality,

329
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:43,040
to accept the reality and act in a real way.

330
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,580
Now you may say, "Mother" this is a miracle.""

331
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,040
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

332
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,750
Maybe for the human beings,

333
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,140
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

334
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,060
but not for Me

335
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,070
because I know what it is.

336
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:30,490
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

337
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:38,120
one has to see how you are working it out.

338
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,890
The whole system of relating to

339
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,680
each other must change completely.

340
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,400
That is very important, at least for western people.

341
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,040
Because at least in India people know

342
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,020
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

343
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,140
you have to take to your ascent -

344
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,220
I mean the real Indians.

345
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:54,500
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

346
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,020
and then disappear, some of them do.

347
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,230
But mostly they know that you have to be

348
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:16,750
conscious of what you have got.

349
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:36,090
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

350
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,780
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

351
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,850
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

352
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,080
say of some great saint.

353
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,840
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

354
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,050
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

355
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,350
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

356
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,830
If your names are taken, why don't the vibrations flow?

357
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:41,340
And in this you have greater advantages

358
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,490
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

359
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:49,400
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

360
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:01,920
But the disadvantage of that is
this: that you take it for granted.

361
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:23,980
Sometimes Frenc is smail, sometimes is so big.

362
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:34,290
Now, in expression, when we say something,

363
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,350
when we express; are we natural,

364
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,830
are we it doing from our heart?

365
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:55,210
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

366
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,810
is what I want you to achieve.

367
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,300
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

368
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:18,110
others will just take it for granted.

369
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,340
They do not want to help.

370
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:32,010
They want everything to be ready-made.

371
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,090
That shows that they are not conscious

372
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,470
of their own powers of enjoyment.

373
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,060
If they do it from their heart,

374
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:58,720
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

375
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,260
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

376
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:06,440
or what they have achieved.

377
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:30,580
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

378
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:35,170
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

379
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:48,280
Now the second stage would be

380
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:54,250
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

381
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,120
where there will be no mistakes.

382
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,220
Whatever you will do

383
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:15,950
may appear to be a mistake will turn out to be all right.

384
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,850
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

385
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,990
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

386
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,350
they think I'm saying it to them.

387
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,470
Now for example, today I had My watch,

388
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:52,800
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

389
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,670
say, simple thing.

390
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:04,580
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

391
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,080
but quite consciously.

392
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:16,740
Because the watch stopped and I knew the time,

393
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,870
what time I have to be there for puja.

394
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:32,510
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

395
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:50,130
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

396
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,290
But that was not the time I had to come.

397
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:07,190
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

398
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,830
So whatever mischief you play,

399
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,100
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

400
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,960
And then you can make a drama.

401
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:38,560
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things
like that, for nothing at all.

402
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:49,140
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

403
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:56,280
Just now the stage at which we are,

404
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:59,030
we are still making lots of mistakes

405
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:03,780
because we are not Self-conscious.

406
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,060
In a gross way we understand

407
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,090
this word self-consciousness like this:

408
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,350
When a person has to go for an interview

409
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,450
then, he selects his suit properly,

410
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,770
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

411
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:31,660
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

412
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,390
But when it is the question of your ascent,

413
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,160
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

414
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,510
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

415
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,250
put us in the cradle and take us there.

416
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:10,810
This is being childish!

417
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:21,690
You have to mature in your ascent.

418
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:32,010
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

419
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:37,930
Face yourself every day!

420
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:46,040
In reality, see how much time you spend about

421
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:52,100
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

422
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:17,030
Have you left everything,

423
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,730
all your worries to God Almighty?

424
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:31,460
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

425
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:43,490
Have you come out all the way, leaving
everything that was nonsensical?

426
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,010
And how do I relate to others?

427
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:04,250
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

428
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:15,540
I am surprised sometimes, if the
one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

429
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:19,010
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

430
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:25,980
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

431
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,830
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

432
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:49,590
pays more attention to the negative people

433
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:53,120
than to the positive.

434
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,940
He relates better to the people who are negative

435
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,790
than to the people who are positive.

436
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,510
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

437
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,420
than with the positive.

438
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:31,540
You have to cling on to the positive.

439
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:40,790
But it's always the other way round because
also is a very subtle ego in there.

440
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:50,600
All these subtle understanding

441
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:53,840
I have told you many a time.

442
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:06,780
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

443
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,900
like a spoiled computer,

444
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,660
you can reach some conclusions

445
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:17,820
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

446
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,100
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

447
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,560
A simple thing.

448
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:46,200
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

449
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,050
That is as if you should not understand

450
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:54,320
why you're behaving like this?

451
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:05,320
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

452
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:16,980
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

453
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:21,050
which has got love in it,

454
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:26,630
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

455
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:41,820
This complicated brain is to be put right,

456
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:49,670
and the best way is to stop thinking.

457
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:54,630
Just stop thinking.

458
01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:00,120
That's what you have to do.

459
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:11,010
Now when you stop thinking you
feel that nothing can be done.

460
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:23,010
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

461
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:29,390
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

462
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:35,040
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

463
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:39,050
Can you hear My thinking?

464
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:49,760
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

465
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,370
Then you just start thinking about it,

466
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:55,480
"I have to enlighten."

467
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:03,340
Will it get enlightened?

468
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:11,910
This is to be understood, that by
thinking you do not do anything.

469
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:22,870
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

470
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:33,080
and is used to avoid work.

471
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,380
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

472
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:45,340
that "We are going out. Will you
be cooking something for us?"

473
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:49,520
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

474
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:59,230
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

475
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:06,310
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

476
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:12,010
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

477
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:17,560
She was a western lady.

478
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:24,750
So my husband said, "All right, we are
going to eat outside. You stay at home."

479
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,980
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

480
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:33,300
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

481
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:47,330
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

482
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,540
the cleverness.

483
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:06,400
So you do not argue about it.

484
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:10,260
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

485
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:17,060
You do not argue with your leaders.

486
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,970
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

487
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,830
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

488
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:32,800
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

489
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,650
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

490
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:39,640
they have nothing to do with that.

491
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,150
Supposing you are working in an office

492
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,050
and the husband is some great official

493
01:13:55,270 --> 01:14:00,280
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

494
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:18,120
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

495
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:24,220
nourish the husband with love

496
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,980
from their heart and not from their brains.

497
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:50,070
I think it's so great to have
been born as a woman Myself,

498
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:56,770
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

499
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:13,060
The emotions of My love,

500
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:19,300
the working and the play of My love.

501
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,840
It's so great

502
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:32,770
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

503
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,370
So the women should not feel degraded

504
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,820
if they have to look after the heart,

505
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:00,170
but they are in a higher, in a way,

506
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,890
in a higher aspect.

507
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:12,130
You can do without thinking but
you cannot do without the heart.

508
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:20,120
So the ladies should not argue

509
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:26,560
with their husbands if they are leaders,

510
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:34,240
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

511
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,070
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

512
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,440
the men become deaf.

513
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:50,900
They just don't listen what women are talking.

514
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,620
If they are very aggressive, then the men

515
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:08,630
become absolutely shut up.

516
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:19,460
So in relationship with each other,

517
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,990
you must behave in a natural way

518
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:27,100
that you are a man and you are a woman.

519
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:37,740
You should become more a woman and more a man

520
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:45,340
and then you will see the fun.

521
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,180
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

522
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,900
what would have happened?

523
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:08,070
So we have to know that in our awareness

524
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:13,420
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

525
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:22,810
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

526
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:37,830
that is the collective consciousness
of Virat, of the brain,

527
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:44,920
that is of Sahasrara.

528
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:53,290
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

529
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:06,910
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

530
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:19,450
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

531
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:27,100
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

532
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:33,380
according to the Deity, surrendered
at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

533
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:44,350
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

534
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:49,130
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

535
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:03,460
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

536
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:11,210
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

537
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:35,280
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

538
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:47,590
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

539
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,880
And it's so, so simple for you,

540
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,530
because you have the Deity,

541
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:06,180
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

542
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:10,560
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

543
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:13,600
have seen that Deity.

544
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,740
They say that you have to ask for three things

545
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:38,440
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

546
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,890
meaning to see God, salokya;

547
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:47,060
samipya, the closeness with God

548
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:52,470
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

549
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:07,490
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with God

550
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:17,220
which is not in the concept of any one

551
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:22,320
of the yogis and the saints and
the seers who have been before.

552
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:35,240
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

553
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,700
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

554
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:48,480
they are no more.

555
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:13,210
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

556
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:22,120
You must understand your greatness

557
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:30,350
and you must understand how you people

558
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:38,980
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

559
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:52,070
So now there's no time for lethargy.

560
01:23:54,630 --> 01:24:00,000
Now you have to rise and awake.

561
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,460
Today is the day when I hope

562
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,400
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

563
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,640
But only by effort you will stay there,

564
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:28,390
otherwise you will again slip down.

565
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:40,350
So go through this lecture again and again,

566
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,210
and do not think about it.

567
01:24:54,670 --> 01:25:00,310
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

568
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:04,220
For all of you,

569
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,810
each of you,

570
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,980
and you must know yourself

571
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:14,570
how far you are going every day.

572
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:29,220
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

573
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,270
Actually, if you see, it is according to

574
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:40,230
the sun calendar,

575
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:44,630
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

576
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:53,600
It is a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

577
01:25:55,230 --> 01:26:02,070
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

578
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:12,370
So one has to know that the calendar of God

579
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:17,350
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

580
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,350
According to certain calendars,

581
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:29,260
I should have come two thousand years later

582
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:41,200
and some think I should have come

583
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:45,510
at least two thousand years back,

584
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:52,140
in this form.

585
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:59,150
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

586
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:03,020
everything is all right.

587
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:13,170
You are not robots, you are not machines,

588
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:21,870
you are evolved through the evolutionary process.

589
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:28,100
And through evolutionary process only

590
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:32,740
you have to achieve the higher personality.

591
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,300
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

592
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:52,430
it's you who have to show the results.

593
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:11,970
We may take your Sahasrara

594
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:17,860
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

595
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:33,850
So you have to know that whatever heights

596
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:39,060
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

597
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:43,420
with full will power and action.

598
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:05,430
May God bless you!

599
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:11,320
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

600
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:16,810
Do not take it as anything ill.

601
01:29:30,220 --> 01:29:33,120
I could not have said this even two years back

602
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:37,220
or one year back, because you are at the stage

603
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:40,880
where I can say these things to you.

604
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:51,010
You can understand it, but

605
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:54,370
it has to become your consciousness.

606
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:06,270
The stage has reached to understand,

607
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:09,540
but it should become your consciousness.

608
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:14,680
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

609
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:28,360
So, again, may God bless you!

610
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:33,320
There are some very new people.
They should excuse Me because

611
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:36,880
I had to say these things today.
