1
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:13,743
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware,

2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,121
where you cross your mind, you go above your mind.

3
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:25,796
Mind cannot affect you, this is the first 
stage, as we call, is thoughtless awareness.

4
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:32,425
Second one is where you start seeing the working of this Paramchaitanya,

5
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:37,665
of this All-pervading Power and you start becoming aware t

6
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:45,588
hat there is lot of truth in what Mataji says.

7
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:50,837
That there is this Power that works out many things.

8
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,740
It works miraculously so many things for you.

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:02,171
It gives you blessings, It guides you, It 
helps you in so many ways It helps you.

10
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:08,985
It gives you good health, good wealth, and also a very good society

11
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:13,224
of very beautiful people in the collective.

12
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:17,407
All that you can see clearly is happening here.

13
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:34,817
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless awareness

14
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:43,355
is very simple and easy, but to maintain at that point is difficult,

15
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:48,676
we still react and we think.

16
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:51,313
Anything you see, you react.

17
00:01:51,393 --> 00:02:02,139
To get to that point in thoughtless awareness is first to change your attention.

18
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:11,247
Now, for example, once we were climbing a very high mountain to see one temple

19
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:16,459
called Palitana – Myself, My son-in-law and My daughter.

20
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,611
And we were really tired because we had to climb – I don’t know how many steps –

21
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,094
and when we went up we were tired and there was a little canopy

22
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:30,350
made of beautiful marble carving, so we just lay down there ourselves.

23
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:35,618
They were very tired and they said : “What is this kind of a temple?”

24
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,038
They were grudging.

25
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:44,756
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful elephants were carved.

26
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,370
So I told My son-in-law :

27
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,425
“Look at these elephants, they all have tails of different types.”

28
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:57,836
He said “Mummy, we are all dying, how can you see the tails of elephants?”

29
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:04,796
But is just to divert their attention from that tiredness,

30
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:10,737
I told them that – why not see the tails 
of the elephant, which is very different.

31
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:17,784
So what happens that, when you are putting your attention

32
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:21,030
so much to outside all the time,

33
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:26,999
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

34
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:31,627
For example, you see these beautifully made things here.

35
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:36,356
Your attention is something else – just try to enjoy the beauty of that.

36
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:42,388
See, there are beautiful carpets here, just look at them without thinking,

37
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:45,196
because they don’t belong to you, so no headache,

38
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:49,162
they belong to somebody else, is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to you,

39
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:52,269
you start thinking ; “Oh, My God, I have spread them here,

40
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,329
what will happen, they have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing like that.

41
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,250
That’s common human reaction.

42
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,913
But if it doesn’t belong to you, you can watch it nicely.

43
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,579
Now you watch it and don’t think.

44
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:11,078
You’ll be amazed, when you see the beauty that is put inside this,

45
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,946
you’ll see the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance into it,

46
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:20,273
and you’ll be amazed, after Realization, that,

47
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:27,271
this exuberance will fill into you and a cool kind of a relaxation

48
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,379
will come into you, and this Kundalini will rise,

49
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,866
and you’ll become steady in your thoughtless awareness.

50
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:38,710
So whenever you look at anything,

51
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:46,836
look at any beautiful thing, even say, today’s election,

52
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,189
just watch the man who is elected.

53
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:55,320
Watching him itself, gives him blessings, gives him better ideas.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,791
You get also ideas, which are coming from reality, which are there :

55
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:11,454
how to make this man a successful person, 
or this country a successful democracy.

56
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:16,835
All these things happen when your attention is diverted

57
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:23,257
from criticizing, from reacting.

58
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:28,520
Just you watch, become the witness, try to witness everything.

59
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,743
It’s not so very yet practised.

60
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:39,256
So far, I’ve seen, that whenever even 
we get our- achieve our Realization,

61
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:43,651
we don’t realize that we have to witness everything.

62
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:47,385
When you start witnessing through your Spirit,

63
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:53,390
then you don’t see the bad points of another, but you see the good points.

64
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:59,175
You just pick up the person with very good points.

65
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:06,726
So once you see that the witness state enlarges,

66
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:09,688
and you start enjoying another person,

67
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,606
you start enjoying everything that is there,

68
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:19,829
even a small blade of grass you can enjoy, if you have that capacity.

69
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:27,010
In Japan, Zen system started on these lines.

70
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,179
And he made, Viditama was the person who started it,

71
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:42,654
he made a garden out of moss, different moss, and very small.

72
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:45,309
Then there were little, little flowers also.

73
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,361
And hardly about five feet of the garden,

74
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:55,180
which looks like a shape of a question mark you can say.

75
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,626
You have to go on a lift, and you reach that platform

76
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:05,210
on top of a hill, or a mountain, where you see this.

77
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,420
All little, little mosses are there,

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,548
and you see, differently arranged, a beautiful garden.

79
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:17,604
When you start seeing it, your thought stops,

80
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:22,924
because such a marvellous thing, when you put attention to it, to its creation,

81
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,641
your thoughts stop.

82
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:31,003
So you must practise as to find out what stops your thoughts,

83
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,633
what makes you the witness.

84
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,823
Once you develop this habit,

85
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:41,579
you will station yourself nicely in the thoughtless awareness.

86
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:50,712
Then you start watching how Sahaja Yoga 
has helped you, how it has been blissful,

87
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,996
what you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:58,359
You will be amazed, if you just start watching it,

89
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:05,228
everywhere you’ll be amazed how this Paramchaitanya acts.

90
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:10,566
Nowadays, this Paramchaitanya has 
become active because of Krita Yuga.

91
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:17,686
You can see from the way it is playing 
around, with vibrations around Me.

92
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:23,803
You’ve seen so many photographs of 
mine where these vibrations are there.

93
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:27,876
Also you’ve seen the photographs of 
many Sahaja Yogis seating before Me,

94
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:32,222
on their heads My name is written down in Arabic language.

95
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:36,249
You’ve seen so many ways by which you can find out

96
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:40,762
that there is the play of the Divine.

97
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:46,871
Now the mind will still try to say something: don’t listen, just watch.

98
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:53,247
The effect of Sahaja Yoga you should watch on yourself, on your all body.

99
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:58,308
Don’t think about it but watch it, and you’ll be amazed how you have changed.

100
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:01,602
To be very frank, when I come to Australia every year,

101
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:04,041
sometimes I can’t even recognize you.

102
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:08,334
You look much younger, much better, much happier.

103
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,592
And I don’t recognize who are these people.
