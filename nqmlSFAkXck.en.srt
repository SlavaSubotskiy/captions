1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,480
Today, we are all going to worship

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,880
Me,

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,800
first time.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,480
It has been always the puja

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,800
of aspect of Me or a part of Me.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,640
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Adi Shakti.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,800
As we say, is the pure desire of God Almighty,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,720
of Sadashiva.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,800
But what is the pure desire of God Almighty?

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,040
If you see your own desires

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,960
come out of what?

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
Not of the divine Love,

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,040
but out of carnal love,

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
out of material love,

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,640
out of power-love.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,480
Behind all these desires there is love.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,800
If you do not love something, you will not desire it.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,960
So these mundane type of loves that you have,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,440
for which we spend so much of our time,

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,560
uselessly,

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,720
actually they do not give you satisfaction,

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
because that’s not true love that you have,

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,160
just infatuation for the time being

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,560
and then you just get fed up with it

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,720
and from here you jump to another thing,

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,480
to another thing, to another thing.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,840
So Adi Shakti is embodiment

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,600
of God’s divine Love.

29
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,320
It’s God’s pure love,

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,480
and in His love, what did He desire?

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,320
He desired that He should create human beings

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,160
who would be very obedient,

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,320
would be sublime,

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,480
would be like angels.

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,320
And that was His idea, is to create Adam and Eve.

36
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,800
So, angels have no freedom.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,880
Angels are made like that.

38
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,240
They are fixed.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,320
They don’t know why they do it.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Animals also don’t know why they do certain things.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,560
They just do it,

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,480
because they are bound by nature.

43
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,480
They are bound by God Almighty.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,560
They say Shiva is Pashupati,

45
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,960
means he controls all the animals,

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,960
He’s Pashupati.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,080
He controls all the animals,

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,400
so all the desires from animals come in,

49
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,880
but they don’t repent,

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,720
they don’t have ego,

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,080
they don’t think that this is wrong,

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,400
or that is good.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,720
They have no karma problem

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,240
because they have no ego,

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,800
because they have no freedom.

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,240
At this point

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Adi Shakti, which was pure Love

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,040
so think of a Father who has put

59
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,240
all his Love into one personality

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,720
then what is left in Him is nothing,

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
He is just watching.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Then what does He think,

63
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,480
He is just watching the play of His desire,

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,480
of His love.

65
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
He’s watching it, how it is working out.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,400
And when He is watching that, then He is very careful,

67
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,240
because He knows

68
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
that this personality that I have created

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,640
is nothing but love and compassion.

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,960
And compassion itself is of such a noble variety,

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,240
that He cannot bear anybody

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
challenging that compassion,

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
troubling that compassion,

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,240
or also in any way demeaning it,

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,640
lowering it or insulting it.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,800
He’s so alert on that point.

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,320
And He is very watchful.

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,320
So a rift has taken place, we should say,

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:27,640
from Him, from His own desire of love.

80
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,880
Now this desire of love was also given a personality,

81
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,240
means ego, and that this ego has to act on its own.

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:52,400
It became sort of an, very independent personality,

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,560
which was free, to do whatever it liked.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,040
I mean we cannot think in our mundane life

85
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
that a husband and wife are absolutely free

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
to do what they like.

87
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,560
Because there is no cohesion,

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
there is no understanding,

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,400
there is no, not that oneness, that rapport.

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,880
But it’s like a moon and moonlight,

91
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,720
sun and sunlight,

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,480
it’s such a cohesion,

93
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,720
that whatever one does, another enjoys.

94
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,320
And in that beautiful rift,

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,480
Adi Shakti decided to change His plans.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,560
Is known for Her Sankalpa Vikalpa Karoti

97
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,040
anything you try to decide too much,

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,480
She will make it break, like today’s eleven o’clock puja.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,960
So when this Adam and Eve business started,

100
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,480
She thought that they will be just like other animals or angels,

101
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,640
what’s the use? They must know what they are doing,

102
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,320
they must know why they are doing it.

103
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,800
They must have the freedom to understand

104
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,320
what is the knowledge.

105
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,640
And – like fixed machine-like life

106
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,320
that these animals are having –

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,640
why should they have?

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,640
So, in Her arbitrary power,

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,880
which was conceded, of course,

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,720
She is the one, who came as a serpent

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,400
and told them that “You taste the fruit of knowledge.”

112
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,240
Now for people who are not Sahaja yogis,

113
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,880
you cannot tell this. They’ll be shocked.

114
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,640
But this serpent that came for them to test,

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,480
and then to tell them

116
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,200
that “You better taste this fruit.”

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,320
This serpent told the woman,

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
not the man

119
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,320
because woman is supposed to accept things easily.

120
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,400
She may even accept bhoots, she may even accept nonsense,

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,640
but she’s the one who accepts.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,240
While the man doesn’t accept easily,

123
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
he argues, he discusses,

124
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,640
that’s why he came and told the woman

125
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,800
She came and told the woman I should say.

126
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
This Holy Ghost actually is a feminine,

127
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,720
and so more nearer to a woman.

128
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,320
This feminine force came as serpent and told

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,480
that better you taste the fruit of knowledge.

130
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Now it was the job of the lady,

131
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Eve,

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
to convince her husband,

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
because women know how to do that.

134
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,960
Sometimes they may convince them wrongly,

135
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,240
tell them something which is very wrong, very sinister.

136
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
As you know in Macbeth, what happened.

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
So many places we have seen

138
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,880
women have misguided their husbands.

139
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,320
But men can be misguided

140
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
or could be guided,

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,640
or could be emancipated

142
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,040
if they have a proper wife.

143
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,400
So he had all faith in his wife,

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,720
believed in it

145
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,240
and they tasted the fruit of knowledge,

146
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,960
under the guidance of this Holy Ghost,

147
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,800
who was a feminine personality of God.

148
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,560
This is … cannot be conceived

149
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,240
by the people who are just getting a glimpse of Christ

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
or a glimpse of Mohammed Sahib

151
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,640
or a glimpse of Nanak Sahib.

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
They cannot understand.

153
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,240
They just had a glimpse of them.

154
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,480
If they had told, people would have said,

155
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,800
“Bah, what is this?”

156
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,160
They would have never listened to it.

157
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,480
So, at that time, the way the attention was,

158
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,800
the way the reception was,

159
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,560
they told about dharma, about ascent.

160
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,640
But in India people talked about kundalini since long

161
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,400
and that She is the Adi Shakti,

162
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
reflected within us.

163
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,800
Now you see, she’s already read it out to you,

164
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,040
that I will be in every one of them.

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,560
Now understand that this Adi Shakti is

166
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,880
the power of Love, of pure Love,

167
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,160
of compassion.

168
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,160
There’s nothing else She has.

169
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,800
Only the pure Love within Her heart.

170
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,160
But this pure Love is so powerful,

171
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,160
is so powerful

172
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,040
that’s the Love She has given to this Mother Earth.

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,560
Because of that this Mother Earth,

174
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,960
the amount of sins we may commit, we may do anything;

175
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,400
She is pouring out Her Love

176
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,240
through these beautiful things to all us.

177
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Now, we have also this beauty expressed

178
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,080
in every way of Her Love

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,240
through the galaxies you see, the stars you see.

180
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,160
Now if you want to see it from a scientific way,

181
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
then science means it has no love in it,

182
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,720
there’s no question of love.

183
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,640
Even people talk of yoga,

184
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,880
where they don’t talk of love and compassion.

185
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,240
When there is no love and compassion,

186
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,960
there cannot be any divine spark in that person.

187
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,720
Everything is completely submerged in this divine Love.

188
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,040
Everything that is created on this Earth,

189
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
everything that is created in this universe,

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,320
and universes, and universes,

191
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:44,080
is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother.

192
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,720
So this Adi Shakti’s Love is something so, so subtle,

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,640
is so subtle, you cannot understand sometimes.

194
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,320
I know you all love Me very much.

195
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,480
It’s tremendous love for Me

196
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,400
and when I get the vibrations from you,

197
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,480
it’s like the ripples

198
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,040
that reach the shores and again they return back

199
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,520
and lots of little, little sparkling

200
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,960
drops are there on the shore also.

201
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,280
In the same way in My heart,

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:40,200
I feel your love echoing the beauty of sparkle

203
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,400
in this divine Love,

204
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,960
which I cannot explain to you the experience,

205
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,040
what it creates.

206
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,880
The first thing that it creates, that tears come into My eyes.

207
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,880
Because it’s the compassion,

208
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,560
which is sandra karuna;

209
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
is, is aadr, it’s not dry.

210
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,320
Like a father’s compassion could be very dry,

211
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
“All right, do this, otherwise I’ll shoot you, I’ll do this,”

212
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,880
he’ll speak. Mother will say,

213
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,600
but She won’t say something that will be that hurting.

214
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,560
She will have to say sometimes, to correct you.

215
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,480
But Her saying is very different from the father’s,

216
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,880
because She has got sandra karuna.

217
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:31,800
Andr. Aadr is the … which is not dry.

218
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,560
And this kind of a heart She developed,

219
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,320
because of this divine Love that She was carrying.

220
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
So every part of Her body,

221
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,320
everything is created out of divine Love.

222
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,720
Every bit of it emits nothing but divine Love.

223
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,040
Vibrations are nothing but divine Love.

224
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,040
Now, as I’ve told you before also,

225
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,880
that this incarnation had to come.

226
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,040
The time had come,

227
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,880
it was all being seen that the time has come.

228
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,400
But there’s a difference between fixed time

229
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,040
and time which is sahaj.

230
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,800
Fixed time is such that you can say

231
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
that this train leaves this time

232
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,400
it will reach this time.

233
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,480
You can say that

234
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,960
some machinery is producing something,

235
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,800
in such and such time it will produce so many things.

236
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
But living things, which are spontaneous,

237
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,480
which are sahaj, you cannot say time.

238
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,560
In the same way this process of freedom;

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,400
you have the maximum freedom,

240
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,880
so one could not say what time this will happen,

241
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,240
that people will be available

242
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:13,160
to receive this subtle knowledge of divine Love.

243
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,120
Knowledge also could be very dry.

244
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,040
We had terrible people in India,

245
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,760
who were busy with the reading

246
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
and with the citation of mantras, this, that,

247
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
and they became so dry, so dry,

248
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,400
they’re just bone structures, they were, just bones left.

249
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,320
And so hot-tempered that they looked at anybody,

250
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
that person would become into ashes.

251
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,720
I mean, is this the way you have come on this Earth,

252
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,560
to do all the tapasyas, everything,

253
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,960
just to make somebody into ashes?

254
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,080
But that’s how they thought that

255
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,960
they were very great because they looked at somebody,

256
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,040
that person becomes, disappears or becomes ashes.

257
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,600
Bhasmisat they call it.

258
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,640
But there was no idea of benevolence in their heart.

259
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,720
So, the first thing that is achieved

260
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,640
through this divine Love is your benevolence.

261
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,880
Now benevolence itself is also

262
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,160
a kind of a very misguided word.

263
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,960
Benevolence means whatever is good for your Spirit.

264
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,800
Now, as you know the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

265
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,880
so when the Spirit in you starts

266
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,640
reflecting itself in its full beauty

267
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,880
then you become the giver,

268
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,400
you are no more a person who has to take anything,

269
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
you just become the giver. You are so fulfilled.

270
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Now, this Advent came at a time which was judged

271
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,400
what time it should come.

272
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
As I said you had freedom,

273
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,480
people were going amok, doing all kinds of thing.

274
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,800
So if you see that, just before this

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,800
we had a big problem of people working out their power.

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,960
Like people will go to India

277
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,440
to occupy the territory of India, or to China,

278
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
or this side they went up to Africa

279
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,080
and all these places.

280
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,560
Even Americans went to – so-called Americans –

281
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,160
went to America and occupied it.

282
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,040
So this was the time when they were using their freedom

283
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
for power only.

284
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,720
That was not the time for the Adi Shakti to be born.

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,240
They were the people who were power-oriented.

286
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Not that today we don’t have, we have.

287
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,880
But these were seeking only power

288
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,800
and also these territories,

289
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,480
which is not important.

290
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,160
So it could not be at that time.

291
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,320
At that time one had to fight for your freedom,

292
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,240
for getting out of the clutches of these imperialists

293
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,000
and people who were trying to overpower.

294
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,240
Now, gradually it changed.

295
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,040
It changed, and changed in such a smooth way.

296
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,880
Is very surprising,

297
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,800
I saw the change coming up Myself.

298
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,640
It worked out.

299
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,240
As you know that I Myself took part

300
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:51,480
in the freedom movement of India – is important.

301
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,880
India started, in India it started.

302
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,160
First the freedom, from imperialism,

303
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,720
and then gradually this freedom from imperialism

304
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
started spreading in every country.

305
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,880
People started thinking about it,

306
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,320
they started understanding

307
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
that no use having colonies and all that,

308
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,640
better come back to your own position.

309
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,040
So when this happened,

310
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,320
I mean this happened in My own lifetime, I must say

311
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,800
first, people who tried to have freedom in our country died,

312
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,960
so many were killed, you know, we had people like Bhagat Singh.

313
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,480
In every country

314
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,800
all the revolutionaries were thrown out

315
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,560
and were ill-treated and killed.

316
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,920
It’s not question of India only.

317
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,320
But that one had to go through.

318
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,160
So their freedom was tested.

319
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,240
Now they thought this was nonsensical thing we did,

320
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
this was no freedom.

321
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,720
Because after all, doing all that, then they started repenting

322
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,960
and developing a kind of a fear

323
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
and a fright from others

324
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,960
and kind of a, what you can call,

325
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,480
a very disturbed Left Visshuddi started.

326
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,800
They felt that … very guilty,

327
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
that they have done very wrong,

328
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
they should not have done it.

329
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,800
At this juncture also

330
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,800
there were other problems,

331
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
like we had caste-systems

332
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,320
and other problems in slavery

333
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,880
and all kinds of things, disparities,

334
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,400
and some people were treated as lower people,

335
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,880
some as higher people, some higher races, some lower races,

336
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,480
all these stupid things were there.

337
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,880
Through their freedom they have created this,

338
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,080
through their freedom.

339
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,720
It’s not so, it’s not, it’s not the fact, it’s not the truth.

340
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,080
But they created a thing like that.

341
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Now supposing I want to create something here,

342
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,560
just to say, that “All right, this is not a carpet,”

343
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,160
go on telling you, “It’s not a carpet, it’s not a carpet.”

344
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,160
The brain is washed, you see, you think all,

345
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,480
“It’s not a carpet, must be something else.”

346
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
It’s like a mesmeric thing I feel,

347
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,000
the way people accepted this nonsense of racialism,

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
of all kinds of disparities, of slavery,

349
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,080
of caste-system and specially ill-treating women.

350
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,040
All this came out of the choice that was given to them

351
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,400
to select what is good, what is bad.

352
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,040
So to them it was very good, you see,

353
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
it was a nice thing to do.

354
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,240
Under these circumstances,

355
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
compassion would have been wasted on these people.

356
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,320
Divine Love would have been a waste on them.

357
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,960
Because mentally people were not prepared to understand;

358
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,560
you could not tell them

359
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
that this is absolutely out of your blindness,

360
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
ignorance, you are doing this;

361
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
this is not the right thing for you,

362
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
this will not make you noble;

363
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,120
this is ignoble, you are doing ignoble things.

364
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,160
Of course so many saints came,

365
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,080
they talked of nobility, of forgiveness,

366
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
of unity, of oneness, everything they said.

367
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
Big seers were born,

368
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,960
they also reached that point to talk about it.

369
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,200
But still people were not prepared so much.

370
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,720
Gradually I think their teachings and all that

371
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,880
started working in people.

372
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,800
But the biggest problem came

373
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,320
with these so-called religions that they started.

374
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,480
These – all religions got derailed.

375
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,800
And they formed kind of puddles, you see,

376
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Muslims here, Christians here, Hindus there,

377
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,880
this is this, this is this.

378
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,960
So you really needed this giver of life

379
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,720
to fill up all these puddles

380
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,240
and make them one.

381
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,640
It’s complete ignorance, is sheer stupidity,

382
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,560
to think that one human being is higher than another.

383
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,240
You can only say one thing,

384
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,320
that at a different state you are.

385
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,080
Some are at a different state,

386
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,040
some are at a higher state,

387
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,800
but in general you cannot condemn somebody

388
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,160
that he is no good, this society is not good,

389
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
this society is … in general!

390
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
Individually you can say,

391
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,920
in general you cannot say.

392
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
But this ignorance was so dark,

393
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,480
because it became collective,

394
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,680
it’s a collective ignorance. Collective ignorance!

395
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,160
They all joined hands together, collectively,

396
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,480
to say that this is the religion that is the best,

397
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,560
we are the only ones which are saved ones.

398
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,640
Another said, “No no no no no no,

399
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,160
these are absolutely condemned people, we are the best.”

400
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,560
And under the name of religion,

401
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:15,240
under the name of God Almighty, they started this nonsense.

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,480
So now, Adi Shakti had to assert,

403
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,320
put the complete force.

404
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,880
So, the first thing She realized,

405
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,640
that one should know what is a family.

406
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,040
A child grows in the family

407
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,160
if the children do not get the proper attention

408
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,640
from the father or mother

409
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,520
we can say if they are also spoilt,

410
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,720
or if not spoilt, if they are overindulged into,

411
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,040
or they are neglected,

412
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,320
then the child doesn’t know what love is.

413
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,480
If a child doesn’t know what love is

414
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,160
love doesn’t mean that you spoil the child,

415
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,160
or you give him lots of toys to play and get rid of him

416
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,800
it means that all the time your attention is on your child.

417
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,480
And that attention is not indulgence,

418
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,960
but an attention for the benevolence of the child.

419
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,160
So all the time you are seeing that there is benevolence.

420
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,320
And thus, I thought the family life has to be,

421
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
first of all substantiated.

422
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,480
It’s very important,

423
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,640
because these days also under the name of religion

424
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
they have started nunneries and then priests

425
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,960
and then sanyasis and all kinds of babas are there.

426
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,480
They are so dry!

427
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,560
And they are so misleading to people,

428
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,960
that people started taking to this kind of sanyasa,

429
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,880
getting out of their houses,

430
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,480
running away from their wives, their children.

431
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,040
So the first point I realized,

432
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,160
human beings cannot have love

433
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,040
who haven’t known what is love is.

434
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:32,520
And this love is more effective if it is collective.

435
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,480
See we, you must have seen that in India

436
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,240
people really love each other in a family.

437
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,960
I mean so many relations we don’t know

438
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,320
how we are related to them,

439
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
we just call them brother, sister, this, that.

440
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,480
We don’t know what is the relationship is,

441
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,120
so whose father was, whose sister, nothing.

442
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,640
But we just feel this is our brother,

443
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,480
and if you ask how is your brother you wouldn’t know how is your brother.

444
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,320
The reason is we had joint family system,

445
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,320
the joint family system just like a collective system.

446
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
So nobody knew who was whose real brother,

447
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,320
who was his step-brother, who was his cousin, nothing.

448
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:20,520
They all lived together as just relations.

449
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,640
But then this also broke,

450
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,240
this joint family also broke

451
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,800
because of economic reasons and things like that,

452
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
whatever it is.

453
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,520
So now at this time when … see these … very crucial time it was,

454
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,160
when the people had to know love

455
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,040
and the family had started breaking in every country;

456
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,720
specially say Western countries,

457
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,320
for men and women never realized

458
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,560
the importance of family life.

459
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,320
They never had faith in their family life.

460
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,320
So it became such a shifty thing for poor children,

461
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,080
they were on shifting grounds

462
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,960
and they couldn’t grow properly.

463
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,880
So they created a generation of violent,

464
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,440
horribly possessed children.

465
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,480
This generation then went into war-mongering;

466
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,160
they don’t know, they feel like fighting.

467
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,480
I have seen children fighting with a tree.

468
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
I said, “Why are you fighting?”

469
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,400
“It’s nice to fight, you know.”

470
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
But why are you fighting they don’t know.

471
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,960
The reason – there is no love.

472
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,080
So everything that you see you detest,

473
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,840
“I don’t like it, I don’t like it,” detest everything.

474
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,480
You try, out of your frustration,

475
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,040
to destroy anything that you see.

476
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,080
So a new trend started.

477
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,160
Apart from the war, when it was over,

478
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,480
naturally the value system dropped out.

479
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,160
People felt, “What’s the use, you see,

480
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,400
we had all these values, so what did we get?

481
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,880
War and war, what is the war,

482
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,160
for war has just killed all our societies,

483
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
they have killed our children, everybody

484
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,160
and what is the great about this war also?”

485
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,080
So the mind of the people on the whole was that,

486
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:26,160
you see, somehow or other, you must fight.

487
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,160
Like the fittest man is the best,

488
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
so the one who can dominate,

489
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,040
the one who can come up is the best.

490
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,640
So the domination of this imperial style

491
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,240
of government was over,

492
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,240
but individually it became a process of domination.

493
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,320
And with this process of domination ego started developing.

494
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,720
Even to children they used to give a education

495
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,240
in such a way that children became very arrogant.

496
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,960
Very artificial, extremely arrogant and artificial.

497
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,720
It was impossible to understand

498
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,880
why these children were not at all controlled,

499
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,960
were told that “This is wrong.”

500
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,960
Because the parents also took a very, very defensive attitude.

501
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,360
They would not face their children

502
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
and tell them what is wrong.

503
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,120
They were so attached to that idea

504
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,800
that these children will leave us,

505
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,040
that they said, “All right, do what you like, but stay with us.”

506
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,240
Under these circumstances even human beings as such

507
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,720
were dwindling between a good family life

508
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,800
and divorces and a funny society,

509
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,600
which believes in sharing women or sharing men

510
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,560
and all kinds of things.

511
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,040
So what a terrible situation was there for Adi Shakti

512
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,400
to assert Herself.

513
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,480
Then also there was very big problem

514
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,400
about these religions asserting themselves,

515
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,480
their own ideas, their own conditionings on people

516
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,080
and absolutely blinding them.

517
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,640
So it was a turmoil,

518
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,880
it was a turmoil and at this turmoil-state only,

519
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,720
Adi Shakti had to come to establish the dharma.

520
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,200
She had to work it out to establish the dharma.

521
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,400
It was a very shifty place, very shifty sands were there.

522
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,560
But when I was born, I was shocked the way people were.

523
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,160
At that time, I don’t think I met many seekers.

524
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
Of course I met one or two realized souls,

525
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,160
but mostly they were worried about their insurance,

526
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,760
their money, their this, that.

527
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,280
Mean if you talked to them, I mean, not know

528
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,800
where have you come, into some wilderness or what?

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
You didn’t know what to talk to them.

530
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,960
How could you start telling them about divine Love,

531
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,960
when they were not seekers even.

532
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,040
Then, gradually,

533
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,720
I felt confident.

534
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,400
First I thought I have come little early,

535
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I should have waited slightly more,

536
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,880
would have been better,

537
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,320
because here the people hate everyone,

538
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,720
and every individual is against another individual,

539
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
and they are cheating each other

540
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,080
and they are also very jealous of each other

541
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,560
and also want to have higher positions and this and that.

542
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Or others, they want to pull everybody’s legs.

543
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
So, maybe that there’s no yet time

544
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,040
for Sahaja Yoga to start.

545
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,960
But then I saw all these horrible false gurus also

546
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,640
throwing their own charms on people,

547
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,760
and trying to control them.

548
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,160
That made Me really, really think

549
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,880
that now I better stop worrying as to what the atmosphere is,

550
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,960
worrying as to what sort of people there are

551
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,800
let’s start.

552
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,720
And that’s how the first Brahmarandra Chhedan

553
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,720
took place in India. That’s 5th May.

554
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:45,040
And – 1970, 5th May, in the morning time,

555
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,720
of course it had some, also some events

556
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,320
which made Me hurry up to do it.

557
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,400
I was quite ready, I knew what was the problem of human beings is,

558
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:03,240
but I thought that, maybe, they may never accept

559
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,040
that they can get their Self-realization.

560
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,640
Now this incarnation is really a very unique type.

561
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,240
So many incarnations came.

562
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,800
They came, told you everything, like words,

563
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,880
and said this is good, this is good, this is good.

564
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,720
Some people, who were enamored by them, followed them.

565
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,240
But nothing was inside their heart,

566
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
whatever they heard, all right,

567
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,160
it’s a sermon, it’s a lecture, it’s a Gita, that’s all.

568
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,640
And the life of such a person

569
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,040
didn’t have that spark of the divine Love

570
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,160
within that person.

571
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,640
We have had lots of good people

572
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,240
during this short time if you see.

573
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,240
If you see, Mahatma Gandhi was there,

574
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,960
Martin Luther was there.

575
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,160
All kinds of people you see all over,

576
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,080
Abraham Lincoln was there, George Washington was there.

577
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,640
We have … William Blake was there, we had Shakespeare.

578
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,640
All this, this time, you see, in the literature, in every way

579
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,720
Lao Tse, then we had Socrates.

580
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,560
Start from Socrates to today,

581
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
we have had lots of philosophers, lots of people,

582
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,040
who talked about higher life.

583
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,880
Despite that,

584
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,720
people were thinking these are some absurd people,

585
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,440
there’s nothing in it, too much to understand.

586
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,560
Nobody would read anything about, say, Guru Gita,

587
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
they would not.

588
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,880
They would think that “What’s this nonsense,

589
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,160
what’s the use, is all humbug going on,” like that.

590
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,240
With this attitude, you see, you find all around,

591
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,040
when I looked, “Oh,” I said, “Wah, how am I to tell them,

592
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,280
what you are, what they are, and what they have to find?”

593
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,640
And it was really My desire

594
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,480
that there should be some keenness in people,

595
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,720
just little bit, if they gave Me a little chance,

596
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,400
this divine Love is so subtle,

597
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,640
it will just penetrate into their hearts.

598
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,560
But they would not, they were just like stones.

599
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,800
You couldn’t talk to them, you couldn’t tell them about anything.

600
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,800
And they thought no end of themselves, that’s the worst part of it.

601
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,640
Under these circumstances Sahaja Yoga started.

602
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,240
And there I find that the powers of Adi Shakti

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,920
are much greater than the problems, you see.

604
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,480
I saw it very clearly Myself,

605
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:18,160
because these powers are awakening the kundalini.

606
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,640
I knew I can awaken the kundalini, no doubt, I knew that.

607
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
And also knew that I can do it en-masse, realization.

608
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,720
But I could never think that people whom I awakened

609
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,120
will come back, again, because,

610
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,800
you see, they are ignorant people.

611
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,160
I never thought that they’ll come back,

612
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,080
they’ll practice Sahaja Yoga or they’ll go to this level.

613
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,040
Never, never, never, never thought.

614
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,640
If somebody had told Me I would have laughed at that person.

615
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,080
Exactly what happened was that when I gave the first lecture,

616
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,040
anywhere, that hall would be finished,

617
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
everything would be finished, and nothing to do with that hall,

618
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,080
I was staying somewhere else, it was …

619
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,760
the hall was taken on hire,

620
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,560
and follow-on, of course, very few.

621
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,160
So I thought that, you see, doesn’t go into their heads,

622
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,600
just goes over their head, I think.

623
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,960
They don’t want to understand anything.

624
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,320
They did not understand anything.

625
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,320
Under the great pressure, you see

626
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
I had the family problems, this, that.

627
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,160
That was not so important. The most important thing was,

628
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,480
that how to penetrate into human mind.

629
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,880
So the only solution was to raise their own kundalini;

630
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,520
to create that little light in them.

631
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,800
Because if I go on, sitting down

632
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,320
with the idea that they’ll come around and ask Me

633
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,880
for kundalini awakening and

634
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,200
then I will awaken them – was a wrong idea.

635
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,160
I could realize that.

636
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,560
So en-masse realization started.

637
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,160
And this really surprised people.

638
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,960
It was no magic,

639
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,320
it was not story telling, but it was the truth.

640
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,840
They could feel it on their fingertips,

641
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,880
they could feel it

642
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,160
out of their fontanel-bone area.

643
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,320
It’s the actualization of Sahaja Yoga

644
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,880
has worked the wonders.

645
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,480
Otherwise, it would have been impossible.

646
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,400
All these wonders that you see today

647
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,720
are because your – your reaction,

648
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,480
because the way you reacted, the way you received it.

649
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,280
Otherwise, Adi Shakti is what? Good for nothing.

650
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,280
If you do not accept, I’m nothing.

651
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:01,240
Actually it is again, I say, your wisdom,

652
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:07,800
your sense, your – your seeking

653
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,160
has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,960
I never write letters to anybody,

655
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,160
I never call anybody, that you know all gurus do that,

656
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,960
as soon as they go to any city,

657
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
they write it down the names of all the important people

658
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,320
and then they send them letters,

659
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,960
and get about two, three at least for such programs.

660
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
But without doing all that, you see,

661
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,960
how we have managed this en-masse kundalini awakening,

662
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,720
by which people started understanding Sahaja Yoga.

663
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,480
It started penetrating into them.

664
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,400
Now for that, I have to raise My own Kundalini like that.

665
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,640
Every time, in a public program, I raise Mine also.

666
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,240
And in My Kundalini itself I catch all your problems.

667
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,320
It’s painful; that’s why after puja

668
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
I become very, sort of … like a stone, I should say, for a while.

669
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,160
Reason is I’m absorbing all that is within you.

670
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,640
Like I’ve put you all in My body.

671
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,720
You are parts and parcel of My body.

672
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,080
Every cell that I have, is for you, for your abode.

673
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,480
And you have to be that subtle

674
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,640
to understand that if we own something,

675
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,800
or if we have something to be done about Sahaja Yoga or anything,

676
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,040
if we want to start an ashram, or anything,

677
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,840
immediately I know.

678
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,080
How do I know is because you are inside Me.

679
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,960
Most of the things I know very clearly.

680
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,560
But some of these things I don’t know that clearly

681
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,880
because of one thing.

682
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,720
The relationship between you and Me

683
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,160
is of course very intimate,

684
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,800
that you should be in My body,

685
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,240
but if you people are not meditating

686
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,400
is very mundane thing I must tell you – Dhyanagamya

687
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,640
if you are not meditating,

688
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,160
then I have no relationship with you.

689
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,040
You are not My relation.

690
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,960
You have no right on Me.

691
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,880
You have no question to be asked,

692
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,240
why this is happening, why that is happening.

693
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,480
So if you do not meditate – I always say meditate, meditate

694
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,080
I have nothing to do with you.

695
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,640
Are no more there for Me.

696
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,800
It has no connection with Me.

697
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,880
Then you are like all other people.

698
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,320
You may be Sahaja yogis,

699
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,480
you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree

700
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,040
from your leaders maybe, I don’t know,

701
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,720
and maybe that you are regarded as something very great.

702
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,200
But, if you do not do your meditation

703
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,640
every day, evening, morning or evening,

704
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:31,240
you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji.

705
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,320
Because the connection is only through gyana,

706
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,800
through meditation.

707
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,160
I have known people who do not do meditation.

708
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,480
Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens;

709
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,400
then they start coming and telling Me.

710
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,400
But I see clearly that the person is not meditating,

711
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
I have no relationship with him.

712
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,440
He has no right to ask Me anything.

713
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,800
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

714
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,160
But once you will know what is meditation is,

715
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,640
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

716
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,480
how we can have a rapport with each other.

717
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,320
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

718
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,240
like writing letters or maybe some sort

719
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

720
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,720
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

721
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,160
In meditation you grow.

722
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,400
In that spiritually you become higher.

723
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,320
And when that happens, you start,

724
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,960
in a way, I would say

725
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,640
that when you reach a state of

726
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:55,560
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

727
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,560
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

728
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,760
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

729
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,720
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

730
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,800
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

731
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,400
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

732
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,720
Then I’m responsible for you,

733
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,560
for your children, for everyone.

734
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,480
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

735
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,240
to save you from all your negativity.

736
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,520
So it’s not like a father

737
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,640
who will directly punish you,

738
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,640
it’s not that, but it’s just

739
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,400
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

740
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,160
That’s the only thing that can happen.

741
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,560
If you are not meditating, all right,

742
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,160
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

743
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,640
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

744
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,160
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

745
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,480
you cannot have without meditation.

746
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,080
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

747
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,400
please meditate every day.

748
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,240
But I think people are also not understanding

749
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,800
the importance of what I am saying,

750
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,240
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

751
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,240
“Why?”

752
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,640
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

753
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,560
Now this instrument is fully made,

754
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,400
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

755
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,080
what’s the use of having it.

756
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,240
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

757
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,240
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

758
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,800
a complete panorama changes.

759
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,400
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

760
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,560
a very different temperament,

761
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,080
a very different life and he lives always

762
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,160
in complete satisfaction with himself.

763
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,960
So today as being the first day, as you say,

764
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,400
of the Advent, say, we can say that it is the first day

765
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,320
when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today

766
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,040
of course it was not today, but still we can say that if that is so.

767
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:29,040
If it has happened and it has been helpful to you,

768
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,400
it has been a great blessing to you,

769
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,080
then must know how to preserve it,

770
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
must know how to enhance it,

771
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,800
must know how to enjoy it.

772
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,840
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

773
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,240
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

774
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,640
But you should have a full oneness

775
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,080
with the Divine, full oneness.

776
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,640
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

777
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,520
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

778
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,800
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

779
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,400
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

780
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:21,240
or that time we want to see the watch.

781
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,400
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

782
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,960
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

783
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,960
but that’s only in the beginning.

784
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,240
But gradually you will be all right.

785
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,800
Gradually you will master it.

786
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,040
Gradually you will know it so well

787
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,400
that you would not like to have anything else

788
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,040
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

789
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,880
You see, so to get to your beauty,

790
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,400
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

791
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,040
which is now exposed,

792
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,480
only thing you have to do really religiously

793
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,080
is to meditate.

794
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,320
That’s not that “Tonight I came very late so I need not meditate.

795
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,800
Tomorrow, you see, I have to go for work

796
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
so I cannot meditate.”

797
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:19,160
Nobody wants to know the excuses. It’s between you and yourself.

798
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,320
It is your gain, nobody else’s.

799
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,040
It’s for your gain everything is happening.

800
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,560
Now one has to know

801
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,240
that we have achieved a certain height of evolution.

802
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,800
And from this height you might go up to here, up to here,

803
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,400
up to here. I’m not saying it’s not possible to do that.

804
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:51,320
But, first and foremost thing, that whatever you may be,

805
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,240
may consider you to be a very high-class Sahaja yogi,

806
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,120
you have to be humble about meditation.

807
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,720
This meditative quality …

808
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,720
even when I’m talking to you, it’s just, I am getting into it,

809
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,240
because it’s so joy-giving.

810
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,400
You just jump into the ocean of joy.

811
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,400
First, it will be difficult,

812
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,320
but after some time you will know that this connection

813
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,160
that you have with Shri Mataji

814
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,840
is the only connection that you were looking out for.

815
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:37,640
And also there is another point people get lost with,

816
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,160
which I have seen very common

817
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,000
with some people who get lost.

818
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,640
They meditate individually, very much, it is very correct.

819
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,240
Individually they will meditate.

820
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,880
And they will sit down, meditate, we do puja, we do …

821
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,800
But collectively they will not meditate.

822
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,680
So this is another point one has to remember,

823
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,560
that you have to be collectively meditating.

824
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,600
Because I am a Collective Being of all you.

825
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,880
And when you meditate collectively, you are really very close to Me.

826
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,640
So even if you have a program or something,

827
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,480
you must do some meditation with it.

828
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,720
Always have meditation as the priority for any program.

829
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,560
You sing the songs, is over, everything is done, then you meditate.

830
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,160
If I’m insisting on something,

831
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,800
you must know that this must be the truth I’m telling you,

832
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,160
absolutely the basis of it,

833
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,840
though it looks rather mundane, but it’s very important.

834
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,640
Now for us to worship Adi Shakti,

835
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,680
I don’t know, or, because there has been no,

836
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,880
no prayers or anything about Adi Shakti.

837
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,640
Up to Bhagawati they have gone,

838
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,840
but beyond Bhagawati they have not gone.

839
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,800
So I don’t know what sort of pujas you will have,

840
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:26,240
but let’s try something, maybe.

841
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,800
I think the meditation is the best way

842
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,800
we can really achieve something,

843
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,440
so we can go into meditation for about five minutes.

844
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,360
Please close your eyes.

845
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,320
Eleven Rudras are awakened

846
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,480
and they will destroy all that is negative.
