1
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,746
Don't know here

2
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,916
People in delhi

3
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:21,396
Have ever heard about
kundalini or not

4
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,583
And some of you have come new

5
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,827
But as many as are

6
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,700
They know what kundalini is

7
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,465
What does she work

8
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:36,853
Which of ours

9
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,040
In which part of the body

10
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:44,577
And how is it in us

11
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,916
Spreads self-realization

12
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:53,858
And you people

13
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:57,440
5-7 have come here from Jangpura

14
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,300
So I

15
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:01,586
Kinda explain to you

16
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:05,123
That,What is Kundalini

17
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,429
and self realization
how important it is to be

18
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,234
But I do not know
that in Jagpura

19
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,495
We have a center or not

20
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:21,004
Our center is on Pandara Road

21
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,996
Which is a very
close place from here

22
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,767
And you all go there

23
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,442
About Kundalini

24
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,799
Can take all information

25
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:35,108
What is this thing

26
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,774
And what mother is saying

27
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:42,019
After that if you allow

28
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,222
So the rest who are
sahajayogi,I will talk to them

29
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,722
Because very few
people have come here

30
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,269
Is surprising

31
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,803
That in our India

32
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:57,568
Delhi which is its capital

33
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,174
Anyone that ever divine
discovery is not special

34
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:04,940
Now if someone in our place
Tantric would have come

35
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
So here it all breaks

36
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:14,737
I don't understand why people
are not fond of reality

37
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,827
Why does everyone
get down to imitation

38
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:23,255
Where you are told that Babaji Have
come 'Just offer them so much money

39
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,299
So to offer them,
millions People will gather

40
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,870
We get to see the many
spectacles in mumbai

41
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:36,294
One gentleman

42
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,231
The say Ramayana there

43
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,468
while saying ramayana

44
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,764
Sita swayamvara is
also happen there

45
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,657
and with placed statue of sita and
rama they also get there marriage done

46
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:56,050
Then he says to whom
to bestow,they bestow

47
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:59,405
So is a special day
The day of marriage

48
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:04,623
So whomever you give to the girl It
happens to be jewelry or something

49
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,128
Saree n all

50
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,699
People reach them
with everything

51
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:13,785
And thus do kanyadaan thinks that
we have earned a lot of wealth

52
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,505
And we're going to have a
wonderful advantage here

53
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,729
So we're going to get
at least one million

54
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:26,163
Many ways in our
country for revolution

55
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440


56
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,883
Man then finds a place and
again reclaims another place.

57
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,081
There he fetches a third,

58
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:41,130
What we are looking for
outside is inside us

59
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,992
We must not find
anything outside

60
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,425
You will surprise that
laxmi ji is also inside us

61
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,077
They don't even have
to look out for them.

62
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,376
So that's also inside us

63
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:58,098
And laxmi may be awakened

64
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,875
And you may also get the
blessings of laxmi ji

65
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:05,300
And within you may
shiv ji be awakened

66
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,768
So you may have soul blessings

67
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,997
But human beings always
love to Lie thing

68
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,441
Someone started gossiping

69
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,971
More people like it

70
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:21,396
Everything else he could
say was that it was obvious.

71
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,836
Get what is real

72
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,130
And do not follow
the falls things.

73
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:27,474
people don't like it

74
00:07:28,807 --> 00:07:31,010
Suppose if people said

75
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,681
that lets offer prasad
have blessings

76
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:36,313
Throw the box of service

77
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:42,248
When the lifter comes, it will be so
light when carried, it will be heavy

78
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,920
For this reason

79
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,042
sahajayog not running

80
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,577
Sahajayog means

81
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:50,952
Easy

82
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:57,551
Believe what is born with you,
that power Sahaj yog

83
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,432
Yog means To be united with god

84
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:07,300
The power of ubiquitous divine
the power of love belongs to him

85
00:08:09,268 --> 00:08:11,738
This must be real.

86
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,694
Really should be

87
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:18,304
Because of that you need a special
kind of consciousness inside you

88
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
That is collective consciousness

89
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,243
Means have no one left

90
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:30,272
You see that you are
always on your side

91
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,960
You can feel it on your own.

92
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:42,443
And what 's the problem with others
and you have a problem and so on

93
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:46,925
Can happen because of
being self realised

94
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:51,143
This is real,not a lecture

95
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,847
Should I give you
lecture or not true

96
00:08:55,966 --> 00:09:00,193
So there are a few of you
who, as far away as you walk,

97
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,270
The rest of them.

98
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:07,786
You can find this system.

99
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,509
Today one gentleman Was met me

100
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:17,666
They got very bad,they said
"we read this book for god sake."

101
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:21,583
But before doing
any work we said

102
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,349
Why did not you
think that people who

103
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,758
To this function.

104
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:28,678
And participate in it

105
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,244
Did they gain anything?

106
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:37,146
You go to any of the doctors
where you get benefit

107
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:41,171
People will benefit from
this and you know this

108
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,431
You will not go to a place
where there is no benefit

109
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:47,050
Keep paying only
for one-way work

110
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:06,821
You too must show strength Somebody say
that this sir is big, he is very successful

111
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,599
This is how you get two to
four rupees Will give away

112
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,949
It is a puzzle that really you have
come to mother's door to get money

113
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:20,089
And the other thing that
who shows such power

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,149
They own that power

115
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:26,518
No one else has that

116
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Every person in sahajayoga

117
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,315
It qualifies

118
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,874
That,to get this yoga

119
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:39,561
To get this self realization

120
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Now you can also say

121
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,939
That,Mother's problem
was very difficult

122
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:48,641
Very difficult was very
Was barely Would happen

123
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,597
I said

124
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,429
But easy for us

125
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:56,912
Because we are rich

126
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:59,195
We know what to do with it

127
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,810
If we know anything

128
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,848
And specializes
so we

129
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:06,022
Can show in any way by working

130
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:09,178
So like such questions

131
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,018
What is the use of asking

132
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,597
So that

133
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,141
What do you use

134
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,741
They should do the same thing

135
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:22,564
That doesn't help you What is
the use of asking such questions?

136
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,697
Mother such hard
things How is that easy

137
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:28,080
Done

138
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,196
Something is there
in me and in you

139
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,419
There must be some thing but This is
the most difficult thing to understand

140
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:43,650
And for which people got great
penance Had to suffer,they so easily

141
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:45,854
Mother gives it how it happened

142
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,140
It should be thought of then

143
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:52,452
That when you are fond of it

144
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,968
Please understand that there
is a diamond placed here.

145
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,087
And we are giving you free

146
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,529
That you would think
that this diamond

147
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:07,658
Take it here and then
see if it is true or not

148
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,867
Then after testing it,
if it is true then it is okay

149
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,852
But if we say that
it is absolutely free

150
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,267
Nothing to do with

151
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,897
So if you

152
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:26,235
Getting diamond for free
Nothing to do with

153
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,804
So all be true or false
What is your loss?

154
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:33,251
And when the mother
Nothing to take

155
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,561
Then why is she doing this?

156
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,201
What are they getting with it

157
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:45,504
So such a person can
also be in the world

158
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,650
That which

159
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,866
Works without
considering any profit

160
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,337
Maybe

161
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,278
You must have
heard at least once

162
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,821
That's why all these doubts

163
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,093
You shouldn't

164
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:05,321
You must think

165
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:10,954
That this Kundalini power in us The
pure desire is in a dormant state

166
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:14,956
Because one wish
Pure and that wish

167
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:17,963
That you are one with God

168
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:22,470
Until your wish comes true

169
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,783
Till then this power remains
dormant Considered to be

170
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,330
And put these three coils

171
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,895
Sitting in triangular position

172
00:13:35,602 --> 00:13:38,747
When an expert awakens it

173
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:41,391
He has divine power

174
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:48,684
Put up some false commercials
And put it on the forehead

175
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,999
That I can awaken the
Kundalini, So can't

176
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:57,728
If there is such a person
That can wake her up

177
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,343
And his identity,Such as

178
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:02,869
It has been told
in many scriptures

179
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,802
In simple language
we will say that

180
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:10,442
Kabir Das Ji has said that,On the peak
of emptiness The sound of the universe

181
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,631
When Kundalini called him Surti

182
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,598
When it arises,
come here at the peak of emptiness

183
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:24,619
First dum dum dum such
heart sounds lap lap lap lap

184
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,895
Anahad

185
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:29,335
The voice of the heart
is known as anahad

186
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:32,189
Anhad,assume that any

187
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:36,872
Hurting another
thing Without doing

188
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,459
Extracts it is Anahad

189
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,644
Now that anahad sound here

190
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:45,179
Lap lap lap
As if the heart is here

191
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,001
And when this cycle breaks

192
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:52,352
So it should be said that here

193
00:14:57,415 --> 00:14:59,415
There is a hole of the brahma

194
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,051
When that

195
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,732
Gets pierced

196
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:07,859
So that

197
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,258
You see that of the Kundalini

198
00:15:11,789 --> 00:15:14,653
Comes cold cool breeze

199
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,576
After some time, that universal
power is also in your hands.

200
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,710
Whose reflection is Kundalini

201
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,835
And you also get cold
breez air in your hand

202
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,879
Cool

203
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,425
Not so cold But feeling cool

204
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:40,008
And peace to many people
Meets and pleasures

205
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:44,008
And many people understand Is
that we are on the other side

206
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,707
A lot of people walk a
little bit with little doubt

207
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:51,451
But in the end that too

208
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:54,039
By understanding
What is the benefit

209
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,798
How is the benefit

210
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,078
But first Need to know one thing

211
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,477
That you nothing
to give to mother

212
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,979
Can't give you

213
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,958
You can't buy me And
you can't even tie me up

214
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:18,096
Just your love which draws

215
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:21,846
So politely accept it

216
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:25,243
If this thing happens

217
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,535
And if kundalini pierces
the Brahmarandhra

218
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:33,977
So this is the place of Sadashiva
Is the place of the soul

219
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,510
Where is the sadashiva
soul lives in the heart of man

220
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:40,005
So as

221
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:44,441
The back of that soul

222
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,500
Kundalini touches

223
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,087
So there

224
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,763
Inhabited soul

225
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:56,029
Comes to our mind

226
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,662
And our mind is

227
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,788
With that collective
consciousness gets published

228
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,797
Why don't you sit inside

229
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,097
Come, there will be no trouble

230
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:26,467
Pageant used to seeing

231
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,165
Now

232
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:43,403
I will request you

233
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,432
That in a while Will
talk with sahajayogi too

234
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:50,109
Because today is a good chance Very
few people have come here from Janpura

235
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,737
And after that

236
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:54,433
We will meditate a little
