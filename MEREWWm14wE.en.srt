1
00:00:52,179 --> 00:01:04,091
Today we are going to do puja to Shiva, Shri Shiva.

2
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:16,798
As you know, Shri Shiva is the reflection of Sadashiva within us.

3
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:21,360
I’ve already told about the reflection.

4
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:28,328
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

5
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,449
the one who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

6
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:42,774
But He is the Father

7
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:53,407
who is watching each one of His or Her Creation.

8
00:01:55,344 --> 00:02:08,001
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely, fully strengthening.

9
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:18,870
There’s no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Adi Shakti,

10
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:27,506
but when He finds that in the play of Adi Shakti,

11
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:38,889
the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her,

12
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,147
or to spoil Her work,

13
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:47,858
then He gets into His wrathful mood,

14
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:53,418
and He destroys all such people,

15
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:58,342
and maybe, He destroys the whole world.

16
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,503
On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt,

17
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:13,814
on the other side, He is the ocean of compassion and joy.

18
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,033
That’s why, when He is reflected within us,

19
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,568
we get our Self-realisation,

20
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:27,439
we get the light of our Spirit

21
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,029
and we get into the ocean of joy.

22
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:40,476
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

23
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:48,791
so those who get Self-realised get the knowledge of the Divine,

24
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:51,830
which is very subtle,

25
00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:00,308
permeating into every atom and molecule,

26
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:07,189
the power of this knowledge is there.

27
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,800
His style is such that, in his compassion,

28
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:26,577
He forgives even very cruel rakshasas,

29
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:32,366
if they dedicate themselves to Him.

30
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:36,976
Because His compassion has no limits

31
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:44,150
and sometimes the same people who are blessed by Him

32
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:52,616
try to trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti

33
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:57,515
– but it is just to create a drama, an event.

34
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:02,811
Unless and until there is some drama, people won’t understand.

35
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:08,968
We had to have Ramayana, we had to have Mahabharata,

36
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,719
we had to have Christ being crucified,

37
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,807
we had to have Mohammed being tortured.

38
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:22,970
All that drama was there because without events,

39
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,635
people don’t remember.

40
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:30,515
So in the spiritual life of human beings,

41
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,382
they have seen lots of dramas

42
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:42,315
between the blessings of Shiva and the powers of the Adi Shakti.

43
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:52,429
As the time has moved, today in the history of spirituality

44
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:55,757
a great discovery has been made,

45
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:59,288
that people can get their realization

46
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:03,866
in the collective, en-masse.

47
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:06,928
Thousands can get their realization.

48
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:12,109
Now, we should know what is that realization we have got,

49
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:17,618
what does that mean and what is the culminating point.

50
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:21,500
First of all, I have to tell you,

51
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:28,243
the mind about which we speak and depend upon is a myth.

52
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:31,056
There’s nothing like mind.

53
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:35,134
Brain is reality, not the mind.

54
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:41,267
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,

55
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:46,386
either we react to conditionings or ego.

56
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,454
Thus this mind is created like bubbles

57
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:53,299
in the ocean of reality,

58
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,119
but that’s not reality.

59
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:04,111
With this mind, whatever we decide, we know, is very limited,

60
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:10,019
illusive and sometimes shocking.

61
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,790
The mind always moves in a linear direction,

62
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,188
and because there’s no reality in it,

63
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:20,293
it recoils, and boomerangs.

64
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:28,299
Thus all the enterprises, all the projections

65
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,504
so far we have done, it seems, come back to us.

66
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:38,213
Whatever they discover, comes back to us

67
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:44,903
as a big destructive power or a very big shock.

68
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,816
So one has to decide what to do,

69
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:55,028
how to be out of this trap of our mind.

70
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:58,187
Kundalini is the solution.

71
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,111
When She’s awakened, She takes you,

72
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,740
with that awakening, She takes you beyond your mind.

73
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,544
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.
