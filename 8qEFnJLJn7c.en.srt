1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:32,960
I'm sorry for being late.

2
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,600
I was really very happy to learn that Sussex 
University Sahaja Yoga centre has been very

3
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,590
kind to invite me to speak to them.

4
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:07,750
It’s such a pleasure to talk to the students 
because they are the ones who have always

5
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:19,290
been, in any country, been responsible for 
any new step, whether it was political, economic

6
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,989
or social, which was to be taken boldly.

7
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:34,030
Students are the people who have their idealism 
intact still and when they are studying, they

8
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,150
don’t get biased easily.

9
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:46,540
They keep their minds open to every knowledge 
because they are new to it, but those who

10
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,620
become experts can become very biased, very 
conditioned by what they read or they think

11
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,019
to be right.

12
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:04,909
But, the students can also be very much vulnerable, 
because they do not know whether whatever

13
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:09,799
new comes to them is the truth or some sort 
of falsehood.

14
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:18,709
So, at this life, when you are a student, 
you have to be very careful to understand

15
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,760
that if you have to seek the truth, you have 
to be alert about it.

16
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,450
First and foremost thing as students we enter 
into university.

17
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:38,799
It’s a beautiful name ‘University’ meaning 
that you get all the knowledge of the universe

18
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:47,290
and when you enter into university, you come 
with an open mind and with an understanding

19
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:57,379
that whatever you have to learn in the way 
of a student, you are not the teacher and

20
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:05,139
that humility always helps the students to 
learn about anything they want to know about

21
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:11,029
any part of their knowledge.

22
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:16,489
Now what you learn in the university is the 
knowledge of the tree.

23
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,940
Knowledge that you can perceive and understand 
through your mental activity, but what I’m

24
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,639
going to tell you about today is the knowledge 
of the roots.

25
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,620
Roots of the tree, from where the whole knowledge 
comes.

26
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:41,290
Now to believe in me or to understand me, 
it is not necessary for you to have any sort

27
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:49,210
of faith in me or a sort of surrendering position, 
but you must also know that if I have to tell

28
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,860
you something new, you must keep your mind 
open to understand what I have to tell you.

29
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:05,389
When we study, say economics, take a subject 
which is very common these days and it is

30
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,250
even regarded as a higher science than philosophy.

31
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,250
What do we learn?

32
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:25,889
The essence of economics is very simple, that 
‘wants’ in particular are satiable but

33
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,260
in general, ‘wants’ are not satiable.

34
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:39,710
This is the essence of Sahaja Yoga also, like 
whatever you want to have, you can have today

35
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,000
and tomorrow you will run after another thing.

36
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,060
That’s why we have economics because this 
is the tendency of the human mind, but why

37
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,400
it is so?

38
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,169
Why is it we really strive, supposing you 
are doing your graduation, you will strive

39
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,320
your heart to be a graduate but you won’t 
be satisfied.

40
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,520
You would like to do higher studies or like 
to take up a job and even if you get a job,

41
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,220
you will not be satisfied.

42
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,659
Then you want to build a house, then you want 
to have a car, then you students want to have

43
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,889
a nice bike, alright.

44
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,389
When they have it, they want something else, 
a helicopter maybe I don’t know what but

45
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,759
it goes on increasing, you are never happy 
with what you have.

46
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,759
Fully satisfied.

47
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:32,969
Now the reason for that, you can find it in 
Sahaja Yoga, because the roots are deeper

48
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,400
down which you do not know.

49
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,169
It’s alright to build up the whole science 
of economics on something but what about the

50
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:46,919
roots that have created this big tree of economics?

51
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:53,620
The roots are that none of these material 
things are going to give us full satisfaction,

52
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,490
this is the root.

53
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:02,540
So what is going to give us that satisfaction, 
we come to the second logical question.

54
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,370
What is the need of a human being to feel 
satisfied?

55
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,379
There is something higher, something deeper, 
something that we have missed.

56
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:16,500
This is definite, now what is that?

57
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:29,050
We can refer if you are not upset or angry 
or we can say biased about the scriptures,

58
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:38,810
any scriptures, I’m not saying Bible or 
say Torah or Indian scriptures or Buddha sayings

59
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,930
or Tao or anything.

60
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,380
You will find one common thing they have said, 
all of them have said one thing common and

61
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,139
that is ‘that you are to be born again’.

62
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:59,919
You have to know your Spirit, you have to 
become the Spirit because that lacking in

63
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,919
us, in our awareness, because we are not yet 
the Spirit, whatever we know without it is

64
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,629
only the mental projection, which is limited 
as our mind is limited.

65
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:17,000
So to know the unlimited or to know the roots, 
you have to become the Spirit.

66
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,789
This is the first condition they have given.

67
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:27,740
Now if you just don’t deny them, we should 
look into it, we just have to become the Spirit.

68
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,849
Now what is that, what is that?

69
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,370
We can ask, which is the Spirit.

70
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,780
If there is something like Spirit within us, 
we have not yet felt it, we have never felt

71
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,240
the Spirit within us and what is that Spirit 
and what does it do?

72
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,830
What are its qualities?

73
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,470
We should try to find out.

74
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,000
That’s what you can find out when you become 
the Spirit, it’s a vicious circle.

75
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,520
The other way around, here nobody will say 
that you must become a graduate to know about

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:09,120
economics, but the other way around thing, 
you have to go deep down into the roots and

77
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,580
how do you do that?

78
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,290
Supposing I say you pay attention to yourself.

79
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,630
A teacher will say ‘pay attention’ so 
all the students will start looking at him,

80
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,370
looking at the blackboard, but I say pay attention 
to yourself!

81
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,090
Then you will say ‘Mother how do you do 
it?’

82
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,280
It’s an impossible thing, how do we take 
our attention inside, it’s all the time

83
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,230
outside, how are we to take it inside?

84
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,220
That’s why you have to get your realisation 
first, you have to become the Spirit by which

85
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,260
you can take your attention inside to your 
roots, that’s why the first condition in

86
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,900
the Sahaja Yoga system is that we have to 
become the Spirit.

87
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,630
Before that, whatever I say, you will say 
how is it true?

88
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,620
You can always challenge, you can always say 
it may not be true, it may be wrong, it may

89
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,870
be false…it’s true, because supposing 
I have no eyes and you start telling me about

90
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,220
the colours, how will I know?

91
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,580
So, anybody will say open your eyes first 
of all, unless and until you open your eyes

92
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,660
you won’t be able to understand what I’m 
talking about.

93
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,900
In the same way we have to understand that 
if we have to know about the roots, we have

94
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,530
to penetrate within, for that we have to become 
subtler than what we are.

95
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,220
We are at a level from which we cannot enter 
inside ourselves, so we have to become something

96
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:40,260
else and that becoming is only possible if 
you become the Spirit.

97
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,630
I hope I’m clear on that point.

98
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,910
Now, how to become the Spirit is the problem 
because whenever a teacher tells you do this,

99
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,230
you say how?

100
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,920
That’s correct, I mean logically that should 
be the question, how do we become the Spirit?

101
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:08,990
Now if I say, this is our evolutionary process, 
we have evolved as human beings, come up to

102
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:15,790
this stage and if something more has to happen, 
it has to happen the same way as evolution

103
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,560
has taken place, automatically.

104
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,550
What did we do to become human beings from 
monkeys?

105
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,250
If we have become from monkeys.

106
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,940
I don’t think anybody remembers anything 
they have done to become human beings or they

107
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,720
have put in any effort to be that, we have 
done nothing, we have just become human beings

108
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:51,070
spontaneously or we can say automatically, 
but actually spontaneity relates to a living

109
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,070
process.

110
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,640
Only living things are spontaneous.

111
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:03,330
You want to sprout a seed, you just put it 
in the Mother Earth, spontaneously it sprouts,

112
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,360
we don’t do anything to it, we don’t stand 
on our heads, we don’t read any book, we

113
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:16,660
don’t say anything to the seed but it sprouts 
because it’s built in, within the seed,

114
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,450
the quality to become the tree.

115
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,930
In the same way, it is built in within you 
to become the Spirit.

116
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:28,500
As you have become a human being, you have 
to become the Spirit.

117
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,420
That’s the evolutionary natural process 
to which you have to take to.

118
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:40,700
Now if you get satisfied just with whatever 
state you are in as a human being, you can

119
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,040
live, not impossible, I mean you can while 
away your time, you can carry on but still

120
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,230
you will not be a satisfied person.

121
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:56,630
You will not be a blissful person, you will 
not be a person who can be called as a person

122
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,490
who has become an absolute personality.

123
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,490
Still you will be living in the relative world 
because of this mental activity which is going

124
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,430
on, which will confuse you completely all 
the time.

125
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,790
You will not know whether this is good or 
that is good, like these days in England we

126
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,120
have a big confusion whether to vote Labour 
or Conservative or this.

127
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,810
We don’t know which one to vote so we will 
close our eyes, whichever I catch, I will

128
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,810
do it.

129
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,140
We don’t know what to do.

130
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:29,060
This stage will go away because we haven’t 
reached that state of absoluteness where we

131
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,410
can decide things with absolute authority.

132
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,360
This is the thing, this is the right thing.

133
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,060
Once we understand this state that lies within 
us, then what do we do?

134
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:53,490
We know what is right and what is wrong and 
right can only be one thing, there cannot

135
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:02,190
be any difference of opinion as to what is 
right and what is wrong if you do it with

136
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,950
your absolute awareness.

137
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,620
But, human awareness is not absolute, if it 
was so, there would have been no problem.

138
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,100
There would not have been any necessity to 
have this ‘mx’ authorised or have this

139
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,640
atom bomb produced there.

140
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,490
Human beings are the only animals that are 
doing like this, you don’t find any dogs

141
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,180
creating any atom bombs or anything to kill 
each other, but this is special human failure

142
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,660
to show that we are not at an absolute point 
where we all agree.

143
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,720
So how to achieve that is the second point 
again I said it is spontaneous, it’s a living

144
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,660
process and you don’t have to worry about 
it.

145
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,540
It’s all built in within yourself.

146
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,440
So, how many of you have come for the first 
time for Sahaja Yoga meeting?

147
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:08,230
Let’s see…(Shri Mataji counted five new 
people and continues) the rest of you have

148
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:14,060
been to Sahaja Yoga meeting so you know about 
kundalini, you know awakening of the kundalini

149
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,480
and all those things.

150
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:25,120
Now we have within ourselves, this power by 
which it is going to happen to us.

151
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:33,330
This is the power of pure desire, of pure 
desire within us because so far as we have

152
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:41,740
seen all our desires that we have cannot satisfy 
us.

153
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:50,590
So there must be some desire within us which 
leads us to completion or to the fulfillment

154
00:15:50,590 --> 00:16:00,740
of our ultimate desire to be the Spirit, and 
this power lies in the triangular bone in

155
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:08,290
the lowest part of your spinal cord.

156
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:19,040
Now this lies there or not, it exists or not, 
whether I’m telling you is correct or not

157
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,820
is to be found out.

158
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,440
You should not just challenge it, you should 
see for yourself that sometimes in some people,

159
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:34,110
there are many who have seen it here, you 
can see the pulsation of this power if there

160
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,810
is an obstruction in this person and the awakened 
kundalini cannot rise.

161
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,920
You can see it with naked eyes absolutely 
with naked eyes, a pulsation, just like a

162
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,220
heartbeat.

163
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:55,270
In some people it is so vigorous that you 
are amazed that this bone behaves, this triangular

164
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,100
bone behaves like a heart beating.

165
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:11,440
Surprisingly, this bone is called a sacrum 
and sacrum in Greek language means sacred.

166
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,790
Of course for all our knowledge, sacred word 
is only in the dictionary, we don’t know

167
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:25,400
what sacredness is, what divinity is, what 
auspiciousness is, thank God there are words

168
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,050
but we don’t know what it is supposed to 
be.

169
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:36,580
Now this they call as a sacred bone and I 
was amazed and I asked them, why did you call

170
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,310
this a sacred bone, when I went to Greece.

171
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,480
I was even more amazed to find out that they 
knew a lot about this knowledge.

172
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,910
They told me that they had rapport with Indians, 
with great philosophers of India who came

173
00:17:52,910 --> 00:18:00,400
down and told them all about it and they had 
this practice with them.

174
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,850
Even the knowledge of their medical science 
was very much based on those ideas, even in

175
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,980
England, when you had your medical science 
first, you’ll be amazed the basis of it

176
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,980
was the same as Sahaja Yoga system.

177
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,790
They had three types of human beings and they 
are to be treated that way.

178
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:28,410
But then suddenly I don’t know from where, 
we started curing, not through the roots but

179
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,720
through the leaves.

180
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,270
If there is something wrong with the leaf, 
you treat the leaf and then you find some

181
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,690
trouble somewhere in the fruit, you see, it’s 
like that.

182
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:45,790
So the medical science became like that, absolutely 
treating the leaves and the roots were left

183
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,790
behind.

184
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,250
Now these roots are within you.

185
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,970
They are there all the time, you are not aware 
of them, you’re not aware of so many things

186
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,290
within yourself, but once you become aware 
of them, as you get your realisation.

187
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:09,490
As you get your Spirit manifesting in your 
attention, in your central nervous system,

188
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:17,790
when you start feeling the vibrations of the 
Spirit flowing, then you can understand all

189
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,790
about them.

190
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,280
Whatever I’m saying here today, you can 
verify it and can find out.

191
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,080
To give you a simple example, is that when 
you have to go to a class of astrology, you

192
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,330
have to use a microscope.

193
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,930
Now you say that I won’t use the microscope, 
I would like to see the skin with my naked

194
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,670
eye, you cannot, what you will see is the 
skin that is there.

195
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,490
But if you have to see the deeper structure 
of the skin, you have to use a microscope.

196
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:56,050
In the same way, if you have to see the deeper 
side of life, you have to use the microscope

197
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,680
of your Spirit.

198
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:05,120
Without the Spirit, you cannot understand 
what is beneath and what is above.

199
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:18,070
Beneath is your beautiful being, the glorious 
human being that is created by God and above

200
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,610
is the all pervading power of love of God 
Almighty.

201
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,850
May God bless you.

202
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,800
I would like to have questions from you.

203
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,559
That would be better than to talk about it 
because I must have given, I don’t know

204
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,640
how many, thousand lectures so far and there’s 
no end to it because this is a vast knowledge.

205
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,250
Even if you have thousand universities like 
that, I don’t think it can be completed,

206
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,150
but it’s so simple.

207
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,700
Once you become that, I don’t have to tell 
you much.

208
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:04,140
Like this room you have done, if I have to 
explain about it to someone, I can write a

209
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,940
book on this and still they won’t understand 
anything.

210
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,710
They will come here and will never recognise 
that this is the book I’ve told them about.

211
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,840
But if you just open your eyes and come here, 
you see for yourself and know definitely this

212
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,320
is the place you have to be.

213
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,309
That’s what it is when you become.

214
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:27,090
You don’t have to know all about it, you 
just become that.

215
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,090
May God bless you.

216
00:21:28,090 --> 00:22:40,990
I would like you to ask me questions, that 
would be much better, what do you say Jason?

217
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:53,880
Q: Is the energy tied physically to this bone, 
the triangular bone?

218
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,660
What happens to the poor unfortunate people 
who might have lost the bone?

219
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:09,820
A: No, I don’t think anybody has lost it 
so far except they are devils you see.

220
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:19,580
It’s not lost easily and I would say that 
just now we should worry about ourselves,

221
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
isn’t it?

222
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,430
So we can help others.

223
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,140
So we can help so many.

224
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,200
If we are not equipped, how can we help others?

225
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,140
First we should equip ourselves then we’ll 
think about others.

226
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,260
I’m happy you have thought for others, that’s 
a good sign of generosity but we must have

227
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:43,010
something within ourselves to give, isn’t 
it?

228
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:55,160
Q: In what way the chakras and triangular 
bone, sacrum is associated with the physical

229
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
body?

230
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,740
If somebody is born with one arm, what happens 
to the chakras?

231
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:08,260
A: You see, even if you are, chakras are not 
normally hurt because they are very much placed

232
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:17,100
inside the inner core of the metulae, they 
are very subtle things, they are not harmed

233
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,530
easily, they cannot be harmed but it can be 
possible that a person who has no backbone

234
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,980
but such a person doesn’t exist.

235
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:37,490
I have seen people with crooked ones and they 
get it straightened and it can work out with

236
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:50,600
them, but without a backbone we don’t exist.

237
00:24:50,600 --> 00:25:00,740
It’s a subtle thing and it’s an energy, 
it’s an energy centre and it may be in your

238
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:07,120
case it may be just on the borderline supposing 
on the lumber area, it may move out with another

239
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
one.

240
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,730
So that is not so important.

241
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:16,360
What is important is just now you see, instead 
of going into details, first we must get our

242
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,050
realisation and gradually you will be able 
to locate everybody’s centres, where they

243
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:27,920
are, because they pulsate and you can see 
with your own eyes.

244
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:35,790
Q: If you see them with your own eyes, presumably 
you can’t photograph them?

245
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:42,450
A: We have photographs also, we have photograph, 
we have films, everything we have done, but

246
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:49,030
as I told you that every person has a different 
style of awakening, in the sense that in some

247
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,990
people like a little child, or say a person 
who is simple hearted, say from a village

248
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,620
where he is not so complicated, I mean who 
doesn’t think too much you see this chakra

249
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,830
goes out if you think too much (Shri Mataji’s 
hand is at Agnya).

250
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,520
Or sort of obstructions like that.

251
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,580
Then, such a person, if he takes, in a split 
of a second the whole thing moves out, really,

252
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,740
like a jet.

253
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,860
But, in a person who is a little complicated 
or has a disease or physically handicapped

254
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,350
or any sort of thing like that, then it takes 
time.

255
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,270
It pulsates much more in those places where 
they have a problem.

256
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,270
So it depends.

257
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,800
You cannot say that supposing you say that 
take my photograph, it may not be there, so

258
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,160
we have of course taken photographs, we have 
films of that, everything.

259
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,870
But on some people we have seen it, not all 
because you don’t keep a camera there all

260
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,960
the time to take a photograph, we have taken.

261
00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:05,429
Q: The

262
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:12,951
camera is impartial so presumably if you find 
one person who has this throbbing, you can

263
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:17,150
do it again (Yogi: but surely Mother could 
you also mention to him that the kundalini

264
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,280
only throbs like that when there’s a problem 
there…is that right?)

265
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,360
A: What do you want to achieve by that?

266
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,380
Let’s see, what’s the achievement?

267
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,790
We should not side track, it’s a very important 
issue but we should not side track alright?

268
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,740
Keep it to the main point, what do we want 
to do, why do we want to?

269
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,050
You see the trouble is we would not like to 
do anything wasteful, naturally, why should

270
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,679
we do anything wasteful, for nothing at all, 
isn’t it?

271
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:53,470
What we would like to do is achieved easily 
for the good of everyone without much difficulty,

272
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:00,450
alright, so now to take a photograph, this, 
that kind of a thing is not necessary.

273
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,790
There is no need to do it, but we have taken 
photographs, no doubt we have taken because

274
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:12,450
you see many a times I have many photographers 
with me and people with a movie sort of camera

275
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,260
are going on.

276
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,160
Then they have taken photographs, but it’s 
of no use, as it is for our purpose, there’s

277
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,490
no need to take a photograph.

278
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,210
But we have taken and now we have got it and 
now as your question moves further with it

279
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,170
that if somebody has a pulsation, it may disappear 
after five minutes.

280
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,750
It may not be there, it’s just there for 
the time being because if the kundalini is

281
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,779
rising, it is moving upward you see.

282
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,929
So it may not be there, it may reach another 
point or it just come out from here (Shri

283
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:46,840
Mataji takes her hand to her Sahasrara to 
demonstrate).

284
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,440
Alright?

285
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,740
You should ask me questions which has some 
advantage, you see, to you and to me both

286
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,230
because this is of no meaning, that we should 
take a photograph, then we should do this,

287
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,770
there’s no need to do that, what is the 
need?

288
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,770
Q: There’s no need for you to do it…

289
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,770
A: But we have.

290
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:07,710
Q: I would have thought that if you believe 
through true awakening people may realise

291
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:20,770
the futility of desiring material things that 
this was the sort of thing you would like

292
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,500
to see established as soon as possible….

293
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,000
A: That’s a good idea.

294
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,520
We have got it you see we have got but you 
don’t know, the media people want something

295
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,780
bad to happen.

296
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,030
They don’t want anything good to be said 
that this is a way we can say things.

297
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,460
I think so, because they are not interested 
much, in this country, not in other countries,

298
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,210
but in this country I don’t think they are 
very much interested if I tell them that there

299
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,820
is such a power and we have a photograph and 
you can see for yourself, and this happens

300
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,570
and cancer can be cured, they are not interested.

301
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:57,570
What to do?

302
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,570
It’s not easy.

303
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:05,720
Q: On the contrary, if you could talk about 
this …(unclear from public)

304
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,860
A: Alright, so next time I give you the responsibility, 
you get them to me, they are terrible, you

305
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
don’t know.

306
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,920
Just, I’ll give you a simple example alright.

307
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,440
I don’t want to talk against them, they 
are after all good people, but they don’t

308
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,460
see the point you see, that is important and 
they just don’t want to understand.

309
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,040
Simple thing you see, they wanted to advertise 
me alright, I’ll give you an example of

310
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,549
these people, how their mind works.

311
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:39,180
So, I didn’t want to say much but I just 
said one little sentence that England is the

312
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,410
heart of the Universe, which I can prove.

313
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:53,240
And then I talked about William Blake, who 
said that such and such a thing is going to

314
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,630
happen and all that.

315
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:01,170
Where he has used the word that England has 
to become Jerusalem.

316
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:07,860
I mean it’s an honorable thing I said for 
them, so they raised an objection today only,

317
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,010
that’s why I was delayed.

318
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:17,440
Saying that if you say England is the heart 
of the universe, the Arabs will have objection.

319
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:25,290
You must understand, you see, you are a student, 
you must understand what sort of people surround

320
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,290
us.

321
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,790
I didn’t know what to say!

322
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,390
Why will they have objection?

323
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,960
Because they too have a place in the universe 
but England if it is the heart, I have to

324
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,990
say that, but supposing I am honouring you, 
why should you not stand for your honour?

325
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:50,000
Because if you in any case go to Falkland 
to save your honour there, and here if I say

326
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,570
a simple truth which I know, you don’t want 
to say that just in an advertisement because

327
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:00,960
the Arabs may catch it and they may disappear 
from Harrods!

328
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:09,260
So that’s our media, must understand it’s 
not so simple as you think but I’ll be very

329
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,809
happy if you can get me some of them.

330
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:20,490
It’s not easy, very difficult people, very 
difficult.

331
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,090
Q: Are you prepared to say anything about….(unclear)

332
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,090
A: Yes.

333
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,220
I’m prepared to say, not only that, but 
I can prove it also but it is such a simple

334
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,470
sentence, but I’m regarded as a Saint in 
India, a well known Saint is saying that,

335
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,510
one should take it as an honor.

336
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,800
But that’s not so.

337
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,810
That’s not so with people you see.

338
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:48,120
Here I don’t think they take Saints seriously 
in England, perhaps, maybe, but Arabs are

339
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,350
taken more seriously, must say.

340
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,049
Surprising you know, how can Arabs make an 
objection to such a thing, I can’t understand

341
00:32:57,049 --> 00:33:01,510
but this is exactly the problem today I was 
facing.

342
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:06,960
So I think you are the students but you still 
don’t know the reality of what these people

343
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,110
are like but one day you will realise.

344
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:14,030
I’m very happy your attention is on that, 
I hope so it works out that way, then we can

345
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,580
show them pictures and all that alright.

346
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,260
Now what else?

347
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:26,741
It had only one purpose that I could explain 
it better to you because I didn’t know what

348
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:32,370
to say to these people, the way they came 
out with Jerusalem and the objection to Jerusalem.

349
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:39,160
After all if William Blake said it but now 
we can criticize it because the Arabs don’t

350
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,610
like it.

351
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,750
Is that the way to look at things?

352
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:51,100
Are the Arabs going to decide for us everything?

353
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,700
Q: Would you be prepared to make any comments 
about life on other planets?

354
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:05,340
A: No there isn’t any, it’s as simple 
as that.

355
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,800
Even if there are, they are not the type of 
life which you are used to the different types

356
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,730
of things.

357
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,839
Different style of life, we cannot call them 
as life because our concept of life is different

358
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:29,769
so we shouldn’t call them but as human beings, 
the awareness of human beings, there is none.

359
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:38,129
But there is something like life you can call 
it in some places, maybe the matter is moving

360
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:53,090
like life but according to the human conception, 
you would not call it life.

361
00:34:53,090 --> 00:35:04,759
Q: Is there any difference between humans 
and animal life on this planet?

362
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:07,019
A: Difference?

363
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:08,150
Tremendous!

364
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,569
I’ll tell you one example.

365
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:17,180
You take your dog through a dirty lane, he 
can pass through, you cannot.

366
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:23,239
Thousand and one, there is such a difference 
between animals and human beings.

367
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:27,569
Q: You were talking about evolution earlier?

368
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:35,039
A: Yes you have evolved to human state, no 
doubt.

369
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:52,579
Q: Would you say in the course of evolution 
that all life forms were the same and at one

370
00:35:52,579 --> 00:36:28,220
point we came at a different life form.

371
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:54,110
A: Human beings are made in such a way, they 
can exist as people who can think and can

372
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,640
create, it’s as simple as that.

373
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,329
You see, that’s why they have developed 
these things.

374
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:08,859
Supposing an animal feels the dirt or anything, 
he cannot remove it but human beings can.

375
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:15,170
He can create, see this is the difference 
and that’s why so many things that human

376
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:27,820
beings have, are only as an accessory to help 
adjust his life to his surroundings, alright?

377
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:38,400
But say you take a horse or a dog, they have 
a certain sensitivity to an evil spirit but

378
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,579
human beings don’t have that much sensitivity 
to it.

379
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:48,509
There are some birds, if they disappear from 
a part of Japan and all that, then people

380
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:54,660
know that there is some sort of rumbling going 
on in the Mother Earth and some earthquake

381
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,229
is expected so people also start departing 
from the birds you see.

382
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:03,920
There are so many birds as you have heard 
that they go from one place to another, from

383
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,900
Siberia all the way to Australia, how do they 
do it?

384
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,309
We can’t do it, because they have a magnet 
developed within them which can feel and through

385
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:14,779
which they go.

386
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:19,660
So, of course there are many things which 
are dropped out in human beings and many things

387
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,579
added to him, but are evolved because they 
can create.

388
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:28,470
You can create.

389
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:36,069
Like an animal cannot create, that’s the 
difference.

390
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:52,539
(Same person kept speaking so Shri Mataji 
asked him to give others a chance and also

391
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:58,880
the discussion is not about evolution at large, 
Mother is saying that if you do not accept

392
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,410
that you are more evolved than animals, how 
can I argue it out?

393
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,869
It’s a fact.

394
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:13,279
You are a human being, you’re definitely 
more evolved than animals.

395
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:19,900
You can organise yourselves better, you can 
create, you can think, they cannot think.

396
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,640
Can I talk to animals?

397
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,180
Can I tell them what I have to tell?

398
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,440
Not only that, their kundalini is not there 
perfect yet to be awakened, this is the last

399
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
point of it.

400
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,479
That’s not so important alright?

401
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:36,200
Now let’s see, some other questions.

402
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:50,220
Same person still wants to ask one more!

403
00:39:50,220 --> 00:40:06,359
Q: If human beings have evolved from animals, 
there must be something that was brought in

404
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,859
to distinguish them from other things?

405
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:13,530
A: Yes, very true, there is.

406
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,269
Raising of the head.

407
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:20,789
You see the way they have raised their body, 
it has changed the shape of their body.

408
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:26,729
That’s why you must learn Sahaja Yoga, about 
how the shape of the brain has changed.

409
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:30,069
What has happened that our attention has gone 
out.

410
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,170
Everything you must know, that’s very true, 
agreed on that point.

411
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,749
That’s the thing you have to learn.

412
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,950
That’s part of Sahaja Yoga.

413
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,530
Absolutely, what has changed human beings?

414
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,390
First of all, they are given freedom, if you 
believe in God.

415
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:51,230
They have been given freedom to decide.

416
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,230
Animals have no freedom, if it’s a dog it’s 
a dog.

417
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,019
If it’s a cat it’s a cat, nature will 
remain the same, but human beings could be

418
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:06,920
a scorpion could be a lion could be a snake 
could be anything so the freedom that has

419
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,130
been given to human beings has made them higher.

420
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:18,309
They got this freedom in the expression when 
you raised your head like this you see.

421
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,489
Also some physical happenings take place within 
you, which of course I’ll tell you later

422
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:27,630
on when you come to Sahaja Yoga meetings and 
all that, you will realise how God has given

423
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:35,880
you freedom and by freedom what you developed 
is the ego within you and that ego has covered

424
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,789
your head and you have developed the ‘I’ness.

425
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,430
That you are mr. x and mr. y and mr. z.

426
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:50,440
That ‘I’ness has come to you, your own 
entity as mr. x, y, z.

427
00:41:50,440 --> 00:42:00,450
You are cut off, much more from the Divine 
power, in the sense that now you are your

428
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,239
own guide.

429
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:07,910
The freedom is given for you to try the freedom.

430
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:16,500
Q: Are you saying that evolution was carrying 
on in it’s merry way and God decided that

431
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,809
some peculiar time …..(unclear)

432
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:21,539
A: It is up to you, of course it is up to 
you to decide.

433
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:27,289
You see at this juncture you have to decide.

434
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:31,730
At human level you must decide what you want 
to do further, the decision.

435
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,730
Finally!

436
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,730
Another student asks:

437
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:47,839
Q: You say the attainment of Spirit is the 
necessary step to see into yourself, but what

438
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:55,719
actual steps can anybody take for attainment 
of spirit and is there only one way or are

439
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:56,719
there many ways?

440
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,719
A: There’s only one way of sprouting.

441
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,200
Only one way that is built in within us, you 
see, that’s the only way.

442
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:15,440
Q: Why as an individual want to attain that 
Spirit to look into myself, what should I

443
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
do, what practical steps can I personally 
take towards…

444
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,789
A: Yes, that’s very nice to say, that’s 
what we have to do alright.

445
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:20,900
That I’ll tell you, that’s a good thing 
to ask.

446
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,869
That is something nice and promising.

447
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:24,869
Alright?

448
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,809
What else?

449
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:36,049
Q: Mother, how far can the intellect take 
us?

450
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,500
Can we understand it with the intellect?

451
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,369
A: How can you, you can’t.

452
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:51,219
You see intellect can only tell you, like 
I came here, it was written University of

453
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:54,319
Sussex, but I have to enter in.

454
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,079
This is like a signpost, with intellect you 
can only know the signpost but you have to

455
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,229
enter in, actually.

456
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:03,900
Supposing I give you a chocolate alright?

457
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,329
It’s written cadbury’s, you read it but 
you have to taste it, you have to experience

458
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:12,579
it, that’s the difference between the two.

459
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:21,150
Just reading that mentally, knowing that mentally 
is something like reading a signpost.

460
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,799
Experiencing it is like entering into it.

461
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,450
Intellect has it’s own limitations.

462
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:33,440
Like, we had to leave our car behind.

463
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,079
It’s beyond.

464
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,930
It’s the intellect of the intellect, you 
can say that.

465
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:50,190
But it’s all poetry, you see what I’m 
saying in reality we should see what it is.

466
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,489
So should we come to your question?

467
00:44:54,489 --> 00:45:01,450
Shri Mataji asks a child what she wanted to 
ask.

468
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:08,910
Q: How does the kundalini raise when you are 
rising it?

469
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:20,839
A: When you are raising it how does it rise?

470
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:35,910
It rises just like that (Shri Mataji makes 
waving up motion with her hand) you have seen

471
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:38,240
it, that’s it.

472
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,460
Shri Mataji (so joyfull) look at the child…

473
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,579
Now any more questions?

474
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,579
None?

475
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:53,299
So coming to previous question alright?

476
00:45:53,299 --> 00:46:02,039
I can tell you in an analogy sort of thing 
because you see when you have to understand

477
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:08,749
something mentally, you have to use these 
worldly things to explain something Divine.

478
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:15,539
We can say that if there is a candle which 
is not enlightened, it cannot get enlightened

479
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:23,109
by itself but it is ready to be enlightened.

480
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:29,420
If you are ready to be enlightened, any enlightened 
light can enlighten you.

481
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,650
But the enlightened light doesn’t do anything 
except you can say at the most it is a catalyst,

482
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,849
at the most.

483
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:44,019
But, just it is ready , it’s all there, 
just an enlightened light comes near the one

484
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:46,570
and it catches the light from that.

485
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,390
It’s as simple as that.

486
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,849
To give an analogy.

487
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:55,380
As I told you, the seed when you put it in 
the Mother Earth, because it is built in,

488
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:01,681
it just sprouts, it’s built in, but the 
process is that it has to be put in the Mother

489
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:02,681
Earth.

490
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:10,339
In the same way, it being a spontaneous thing 
and absolutely a living process, it works

491
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:15,869
in a way that, supposing you have somebody 
who is an enlightened light.

492
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:24,559
Say Ray has got enlightenment, for example, 
so if he wants he can enlighten you.

493
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,500
Once you get enlightenment, you can enlighten 
another person.

494
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:38,209
But Ray now knows what should be done to prepare 
first of all the candle, to get rid of the

495
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:47,849
obstructions, how to enlighten and how to 
bring it to a full bright light.

496
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:49,450
He knows all that.

497
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,789
So there are three stages we can say.

498
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:59,799
First is you are to be awakened, the kundalini, 
it has to be brought out of your head here

499
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:02,539
(Shri Mataji’s hand above her head) so that 
the cool breeze of the holy ghost you can

500
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:04,119
feel it on your head.

501
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:08,900
This is the second stage where you start feeling 
a cool breeze also in the hand.

502
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,720
So many people don’t feel in the beginning 
in the hand also on the head they do not feel,

503
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:21,099
because it’s a very subtle thing, but if 
a Sahaja Yogi feels it that means it has started

504
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,569
but in a very subtle way.

505
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:29,890
Then you must allow it to grow more and more 
and to dispense all the obstructions on its

506
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:30,890
way.

507
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:40,329
Gradually, it becomes a steady light and then 
a Sahaj Yogi any Sahaj Yogi can put it in

508
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:44,690
such a way that you start feeling it in your 
hands also.

509
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,680
Starts flowing in your hands because from 
the hands of a Sahaj Yogi, that power is flowing.

510
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:56,020
With that power, he can handle the situation 
in such a way that your hands start feeling

511
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,309
it, flowing from your hand, flowing from here 
(Shri Mataji’s hand above her head).

512
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:03,930
Now, when it happens, suddenly, sometimes 
it happens to people in a very sudden way,

513
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:09,390
in a sudden rush also because they have been 
seekers for ages perhaps.

514
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:14,999
But then they feel, oh I feel very high, absolutely 
on top of the world, I’ve become a witness

515
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:18,589
now, naturally, because it is such a change 
you see.

516
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:24,390
But, that’s not the end of it because you 
must know how to kindle it properly, to keep

517
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,469
it going and all that.

518
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:29,289
If you don’t do that, it will again come 
down.

519
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:33,539
You must learn how to keep it going, how to 
work it out.

520
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:37,410
That’s the part that’s the transition 
part through which you have to go.

521
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,450
Some people take at the most eight days, some 
people take a month or so.

522
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,240
But once you have done it, you become your 
own master.

523
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,950
To give another analogy, a very simple one.

524
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:56,079
It’s like this, when you are driving a car, 
there’s a break and an accelerator.

525
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,859
This is the freedom that has been given to 
you first of all, to learn how to use the

526
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:03,109
break and the accelerator.

527
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:09,849
To take the car in a proper way, to keep it 
in the centre, the way it has to move.

528
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:15,700
Then once you have learnt it, what happens 
is that you automatically become a driver.

529
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,289
Nobody has to tell you now put the break, 
now do this.

530
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:20,380
You know it, automatically you develop it.

531
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,410
This is the second stage of driving.

532
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:30,799
Now the third stage is that you really become 
an expert in that and you drive without even

533
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,489
knowledge that you are driving, when you are 
perfect.

534
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:37,079
But still there is one more stage left.

535
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,339
That there is a master sitting behind, who 
wants you to drive this way and that way and

536
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,869
the master says now stop the car.

537
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:45,869
He’s there.

538
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:51,920
Now what happens that when you really become 
a Sahaja Yogi, is the point, when you become

539
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,880
the master.

540
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:00,519
You start seeing the driver within you, and 
the accelerator and the break, and you control

541
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:01,519
as a master.

542
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,959
That’s the point you have to reach.

543
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:07,130
So these are the four stages through which 
you have to pass, which gradually works out

544
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:12,519
just like your graduation, without much difficulty, 
for which you cannot pay.

545
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:19,299
But you must have respect for yourself, you 
must know you can do it and you must have

546
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:24,069
that understanding that you are a human being.

547
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:28,420
The epitome of evolution, and that you have 
to become the Spirit.

548
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,339
It works out.

549
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:39,979
It works out very fast, these days and should 
work out in this University also, alright.

550
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:46,569
Analogy should not be taken too far because 
this is Divine working and Divine working

551
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:49,720
is such that we can’t understand how it 
works.

552
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,739
In the beginning, if I tell you, you’ll 
be amazed how it works you see.

553
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:58,519
You will say now Mother explain, but I won’t 
be able to explain so many things.

554
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,369
It’s tremendous.

555
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:03,920
The Divine power has all your communications 
and everything.

556
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:10,810
It’s tremendous and in a split of a second 
it works.

557
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:12,479
It is to be seen for yourself.

558
00:52:12,479 --> 00:52:17,420
Now the time has come to prove the existence 
of God, to prove the existence of his Divine

559
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,420
power.

560
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,329
For the first time you start feeling the subtle 
power when you get your realisation.

561
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:27,579
You start feeling it in your hands as cool 
breeze of the Holy Ghost.

562
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:30,030
First time, otherwise you never feel it, alright.

563
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,619
Should we have it now?

564
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:40,700
(Shri Mataji requests all new people to come 
in the front row.)

565
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,109
You shouldn’t mind if Sahaja Yogis just 
put their hands above your heads.

566
00:52:44,109 --> 00:53:21,609
Yogis will not touch you, but just to feel 
you.

567
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:25,990
Now what you have to do is just put your hands 
like this (open facing up), why? because these

568
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:32,499
fingertips have got the representation of 
your centres here.

569
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:36,459
These 5,6 and 7…they haven’t brought the 
charts but you can see later on, they will

570
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:37,690
give you books to see.

571
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:42,710
These are 5 centres, 6 centres and 7 centres 
we have, so just put your hands like this

572
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:49,339
and put your feet on Mother Earth, because 
Mother Earth also helps us, wide apart without

573
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:50,339
shoes.

574
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,940
Everything helps us, like all the elements 
that are there can help us and we have to

575
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,940
use.

576
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,580
So now put your feet on Mother Earth like 
this and put your hands like this and you

577
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,140
have to close your eyes that’s all.

578
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,859
Just close your eyes.

579
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:16,329
Now don’t try to control your attention 
at all.

580
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:22,200
Keep your attention absolutely loose, you 
just don’t worry as to where to keep the

581
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,299
attention, what to think, what to do, nothing 
of the kind.

582
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:26,470
Just leave it.

583
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:31,160
Keep your hands on your lap and sit very comfortably 
and it will work out.

584
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:52,279
I’m sure it will work out for all of you.

585
00:54:52,279 --> 00:56:12,930
(Shri Mataji places her hamsa on the speaker 
for a couple of minutes.)

586
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,089
You should not open your eyes until I tell 
you.

587
00:56:16,089 --> 00:56:17,089
Keep your eyes shut.

588
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:23,949
Take off your glasses if possible, it will 
be a good idea.

589
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:34,719
It helps the eyes also.

590
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:46,059
Stretch your fingers a little bit towards 
me like that, just stretch them, that’s

591
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:47,969
all.

592
00:56:47,969 --> 00:57:04,739
Shri Mataji rubs her hands and asks yogis 
to see their chakras.

593
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,640
(New people’s chakras)

594
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,339
Shri Mataji rubs her hands and blows into 
them.

595
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:17,930
Right swadisthana is too much, I think you 
all put them left to right, right swadisthana

596
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,000
is too much.

597
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,940
All of them have right swadisthana, right 
vishuddhi and right nabhi.

598
00:57:22,940 --> 00:58:46,920
Put them left to the right, that’s the best 
way, left to the right.

599
00:58:46,920 --> 00:59:04,170
Those who have got it, you can ask them to 
put their hands and feel it, if possible.

600
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:22,239
Please don’t feel guilty, any one of you 
feel guilty that I’ve done this wrong that

601
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:37,440
wrong, that’s not going to help us at all.

602
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:45,890
(yogis working on all seekers)

603
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:53,569
Forgive, forgive everyone, just forgive.

604
00:59:53,569 --> 01:00:01,940
What about this gentleman?

605
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:21,130
Nabhi….let him put his left hand on his 
liver, right hand towards me.

606
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:36,719
Left to the right.

607
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,559
Just don’t think, just enjoy.

608
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:49,799
Those who have got it, just enjoy and don’t 
think, don’t think.

609
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:52,880
Now what about him?

610
01:00:52,880 --> 01:01:04,431
Heart, put your hand on your heart (Shri Mataji 
moves her hand raising general kundalini and

611
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:08,839
then around the heart)

612
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:26,619
Ask him if he has done TM or something?

613
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,599
Buddhist.

614
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:38,469
Right vishuddhi is too much.

615
01:01:38,469 --> 01:02:14,180
Right vishuddhi, right liver put your habd 
on his right vishuddhi and tell him to turn

616
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
his head left.

617
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:26,039
Mmm the whole muscle is…..better now.

618
01:02:26,039 --> 01:03:08,209
(Another seeker had ekadesha due to going 
to another cult so Shri Mataji asked the yogi

619
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:36,460
to put his hand around the seekers ekadesha 
and put him right to left.

620
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:42,819
Shri Mataji generally checked on the seekers 
and directed the yogis accordingly.)

621
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:50,630
Shri Mataji told a seeker who had been involved 
with hypnotism to keep her eyes open and look

622
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:57,400
at me, try to hypnotize me now.

623
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:08,739
Alright now let’s see, watch me.

624
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:20,449
It’s very dangerous my child, to do all 
these things, very dangerous.

625
01:04:20,449 --> 01:04:21,449
Ah!

626
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:27,150
Now see it’s up there, alright.

627
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:54,709
But you have to do something more alright, 
to get released.

628
01:04:54,709 --> 01:05:28,490
These are horrible things, you don’t know 
how you hypnotize.

629
01:05:28,490 --> 01:06:12,039
Q: Isn’t kundalini something I have to raise 
myself?

630
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:49,449
A: Yes she can

631
01:06:49,449 --> 01:07:22,749
do also, but first of all

632
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:34,259
you have

633
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,160
to become.

634
01:07:37,160 --> 01:08:06,349
You have not become that, how

635
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:25,040
can

636
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:34,480
you do?

637
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:49,529
What will you do?

638
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:57,449
Unless and until you become and you understand 
what it is alright.

639
01:08:57,449 --> 01:09:00,589
Q: further questions..unclear

640
01:09:00,589 --> 01:09:05,160
A: First you have to become through the help 
of somebody else, as I told you about the

641
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,620
two lights alright.

642
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,259
One is an enlightened one, the other is enlightening 
you.

643
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:13,179
Once you become, then you can enlighten others 
alright.

644
01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:16,009
So first you have to become that, fully.

645
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:17,839
So they are just helping you.

646
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:24,770
You see helping your light to be there steadily, 
is it improving now in your hand?

647
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,290
Q: No

648
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,579
A: Nothing flowing?

649
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:30,109
Q: No

650
01:09:30,109 --> 01:09:35,509
A: What’s the matter (Mother asks a yogi)….warm?

651
01:09:35,509 --> 01:09:38,569
It will work out.

652
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:44,270
It has to work out first of all, you have 
to become that you see.

653
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,529
Q: what do I have to feel?

654
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:47,809
I don’t know.

655
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:54,179
A: You will feel the cool breeze in the hand 
and cool breeze out of your head.

656
01:09:54,179 --> 01:09:55,809
So many of them felt.

657
01:09:55,809 --> 01:10:00,820
Did you have any Guru or someone?

658
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,460
No one?

659
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:17,739
Q: Not in this sense but we do have a family 
Guru.

660
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:29,160
A: Who is he?

661
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:43,230
Q: We are supposed to be followers of Mahaprabhuji

662
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:45,480
A: Who is he, from Bengal?

663
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,220
Q: No from Mathura.

664
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,220
A: Mathura?

665
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,840
What is the name?

666
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,550
Q: Our family Guru but Valabh Acharya

667
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,780
A: Valabh Acharya!

668
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,780
Tremendous!

669
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,230
Are you Valabh Acharyas?

670
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:01,489
Q: He is supposed to be our family guru

671
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:06,610
A: Valabh Acharya was a great realised soul 
you see, you should get it in no time, in

672
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:07,610
the name of Valabh Acharya.

673
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,679
Put your hands like this (open and palms up) 
Was he the Ashtachaap?

674
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,489
Q: Yes

675
01:11:11,489 --> 01:11:14,210
A: Oh tremendous!

676
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:15,210
Hah!

677
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,929
Got it?

678
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:20,560
Are you feeling now?

679
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,370
Q: No

680
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,790
A: You should.

681
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:26,620
Valabh Acharyas are great, they are very great 
people.

682
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,750
If they follow it properly.

683
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:36,610
Q: But I can’t feel it.

684
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:43,030
A: She has got cold that’s why her vishuddi 
is catching.

685
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:46,489
That is Valabh Acharya’s chakra himself.

686
01:11:46,489 --> 01:11:53,590
Yes his chakra is catching, he was great.

687
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:58,250
They are called Vaishnavas.

688
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:05,250
I’m doing all his work only.

689
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:10,840
This is all Vaishnav Panth.

690
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,670
What he said, I’m doing it.

691
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:17,719
It’s not only worshipping him but you have 
to become what he said.

692
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:18,980
To be Vaishnav Janas.

693
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:30,989
Q: Then you can be Vaishnav Janas by being 
nice to people.

694
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:34,840
A: No no, you have to become a realised soul.

695
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,559
You must have atma sakshatkar.

696
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:40,630
Do you read him?

697
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,760
Do you read him or not?

698
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,000
Q: Not so much

699
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,630
A: Then you read him, then you’ll understand 
what I’m saying nothing but what he says.

700
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,631
You have to get atma sakshatkar.

701
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,199
Q: But I feel this is not the way to get it, 
atma sakshatkar I must get within myself.

702
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:57,889
A: Then why do you need Valabh Acharya?

703
01:12:57,889 --> 01:13:07,920
Q: I don’t know but I don’t think I need 
some sort of community thing to start feeling

704
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,219
in myself.

705
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:12,370
A: Whatever you think is from your own knowledge 
no?

706
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,130
You don’t know anything about it?

707
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,099
Then better not think about it because you 
don’t know.

708
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:23,820
Q: I’ve been taught a lot about Valabh Acharya 
by family etc

709
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,550
A: Did they get atma sakshatkar?

710
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:28,550
Your family and people?

711
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:29,550
Q: I don’t know.

712
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:30,550
A: Then how do you say that?

713
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,030
They are not authority.

714
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:36,420
Those who have got atma sakshatkar are only 
the authority.

715
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:39,179
Q: yes but how do I know who has got atma 
sakshatkar?

716
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:42,429
A: At least you try to find out, we are trying 
to help you.

717
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:45,300
We are not going to gain anything out of you 
are we?

718
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,300
Then why not try?

719
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:58,389
Q: It must be more personal, it can’t be 
done in a public way like this

720
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:03,980
A: If you believe in Valabh Acharya, then 
you are telling just against him because he

721
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:06,570
never believed in this kind of a thing.

722
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:11,720
It was all public, because he was a great 
believer of Shri Krishna and not only Shri

723
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,889
Krishna did Sahaja Yoga with gopis and raas 
and everything, all publicly, he didn’t

724
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:21,790
do it sitting down in the rooms, alright?

725
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:27,949
So this is the wrong idea you have got.

726
01:14:27,949 --> 01:14:34,070
They have all got it I think except for these 
two.

727
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,090
She has touched but no use.

728
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:42,030
You see she is neither a full Valabh Acharya 
or not half way, so if you are educated enough…

729
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,679
Shri Mataji interrupted by same girl in public..

730
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,449
Q: I’m just an ordinary simple person who 
came here to find out

731
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:52,880
A: Yes, but what I’m saying is to find out, 
you must accept certain things isn’t it?

732
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,000
Q: Why should I accept anything?

733
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,980
A: No, I’m saying you have come to find 
out alright.

734
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,590
If you go to a school or to university, you 
have to find out.

735
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:04,889
Not by giving your own ideas, ‘I think’ 
is not there.

736
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:07,190
What ‘I think’ you listen to it, isn’t 
it?

737
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,650
I think whatever you think is different, that’s 
the point.

738
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:15,280
Q: That doesn’t prove that you’re better 
than me or I’m worse….

739
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,639
A: I may not be better than you or maybe worse 
or whatever it is, but you have come to listen

740
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:20,639
to me na?

741
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:26,829
Q: If I would just listen to you and think 
about it and thought your concept….but this

742
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:31,119
kind of physical exercise is not working..

743
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:32,960
A: Is it?

744
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,969
Q: It doesn’t bring out anything in me.

745
01:15:37,969 --> 01:15:41,719
A: What I’m saying, it isn’t in you only, 
others have got it.

746
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:45,969
You are the only one who hasn’t got it.

747
01:15:45,969 --> 01:15:50,030
It’s alright, if you haven’t got it, then 
you haven’t got it.

748
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,489
We can’t help it also, we can’t help you.

749
01:15:51,489 --> 01:15:56,360
We are sorry, that’s all we can say, but 
they have got it and all of them have got

750
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
it.

751
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,440
You haven’t got it and he hasn’t got it 
either.

752
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,440
It’s the vishuddhi.

753
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,480
Both of them haven’t got it that’s all.

754
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,100
Only two persons haven’t got, what can we 
do about it.

755
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,310
What about her?

756
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:10,989
Is she alright?

757
01:16:10,989 --> 01:16:13,760
You see if it doesn’t work out what can 
we do?

758
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,820
We can’t help you.

759
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:15,820
Q: unclear comments…

760
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,820
A: It’s alright.

761
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,060
That’s all, we can’t work on you.

762
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:19,469
This is not possible.

763
01:16:19,469 --> 01:16:24,390
Q: I don’t want anybody to work on me, I 
want to go myself.

764
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:28,510
A: Alright so you go ahead work it on yourself, 
alright.

765
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:32,000
May God bless you.

766
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:41,300
Easy to be worked out.

767
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,969
I saw an Indian, I knew what was going to 
happen.

768
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:48,010
They are very uprooted, they neither know 
the Indian things or the English things.

769
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:50,409
You see nothing in between.

770
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:53,000
That’s the problem.

771
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Immigrants.

772
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,889
They neither know the Indian things, I mean 
she’s a Valabh Acharya.

773
01:16:57,889 --> 01:17:03,770
Anybody, we have so many disciples from Valabh 
Acharya, so many have come and she doesn’t

774
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:04,880
know what it is.

775
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,449
Can you believe it?

776
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:09,660
She doesn’t know what kundalini is when 
Valabh Acharya has talked of nothing else

777
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,660
but this.

778
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,760
How can you believe she’s from Valabh Acharya?

779
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,700
Just keeping a photograph of somebody is not 
that, you must know what he’s talking about.

780
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,600
That’s what it is, they are

781
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,880
a very uprooted people in England.

782
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,640
Very uprooted, they don’t know Indian music, 
they don’t know anything.

783
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,500
Just they wear Indian dresses that’s all.

784
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,660
He’ll be alright, just

785
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:37,920
he has centre heart, he’ll be alright.
