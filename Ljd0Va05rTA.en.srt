1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:07,208
Today we have gathered here

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:11,250
to worship Shri Krishna,

3
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:16,333
the one who was Virat,

4
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:24,000
who fought all kinds of evil

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:31,208
without entering into the arena.

6
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,417
Shri Krishna’s life,

7
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:43,333
it’s sense of is very ... a beautiful,

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:52,083
creative and loving thing;

9
00:00:54,542 --> 00:01:00,166
but to understand Him, it is not easy.

10
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:08,041
For example, in Kurukshetra,

11
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,000
where the war was going on

12
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:17,375
and Arjuna became depressed

13
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,291
and he said that

14
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:27,583
“Why should we fight, fight our own kith and kin,

15
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,667
fight our own close relations,

16
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,417
friends and our gurus?

17
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:39,542
Is it religion? Is it dharma?”

18
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,333
Before that, in Gita,

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,667
Shri Krishna has described a personality

20
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,709
which is a sage.

21
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,709
We can call him a saint. Or He called it a sityapragya.

22
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:05,125
So when asked what is the definition of the sityapragya,

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,041
the description He gave was

24
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,625
about a person  who is absolutely at peace with himself

25
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,333
and at peace with his atmosphere.

26
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,041
Is very surprising.

27
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:25,542
All this knowledge He gave in the

28
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,166
first place in Gita.

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,583
That is — that is the best,

30
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,625
that He called as the Gnyanamarga.

31
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:41,166
That is Sahaj Yoga, by which you get the subtle knowledge.

32
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:50,500
But at the same time, when you see Him advising Arjuna,

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,083
it is very surprising that here he’s talking only of spirituality,

34
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,667
of complete detachment

35
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:11,166
and there He’s telling Arjuna  that “You go and fight.

36
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,000
They are already dead people.

37
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,542
Whom are you fighting?”

38
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:24,125
This conflict is difficult to understand,

39
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,542
that how could Shri Krishna, the same person

40
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,458
who is preaching that ‘you all have to become sityapragya’,

41
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:38,417
suddenly starts telling Arjuna

42
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,417
that ‘you go and fight the force’.

43
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,417
One side it is complete detachment

44
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,709
and another side is the war.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,333
How will you explain this?

46
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,291
Is Shri Krishna’s

47
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,166
own words, one can say

48
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:11,000
that “Once you are

49
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,709
a Realised Soul

50
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:19,333
and you have reached that highest position

51
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,542
in your awareness,

52
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,125
to you everything is futile.

53
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:31,333
But just now, what you have to do

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,667
is to save the dharma

55
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,208
— not the dharma that people talk about.

56
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:47,083
But the dharma  means evolutionary process of human beings,

57
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:52,333
which is going on and if all the good people,

58
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,250
those who stand for righteousness, are finished,

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,625
then how will this evolutionary

60
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,583
power will be saved?

61
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:11,166
So you have to save them and for that, if you have to kill,

62
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:14,291
you don’t kill anybody, they’re already dead

63
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,667
because they’re not evolved souls

64
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,709
and they don’t care for their Realisation.

65
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:28,208
So you have to fight them. You have to fight the negative forces.

66
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,208
You have to fight the wrongdoers”.

67
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,000
All this He explains

68
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,709
in a very beautiful manner,

69
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,542
that we have within us

70
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,041
three kinds of powers, which we also know,

71
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:58,542
and by the middle one that we have,

72
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:06,333
we rise above all these material,

73
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,458
physical, mental, emotional

74
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,709
— all these problems facing us

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,667
into a new realm of spirituality.

76
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:24,291
And that’s what He wanted – to save

77
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,417
from the cruel people, from the aggressive,

78
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,667
who were also misleading others.

79
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,125
It’s a very good understanding,

80
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,500
if you have, that who is your relation,

81
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,583
who is your brother, who is your sister?

82
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,709
Those who are evolved souls are your relations.

83
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,375
They are your own

84
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,417
and, for them, if you have to fight the people

85
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,291
who are aggressive people, you better do it.

86
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:10,083
You have to do it. That is the way of dharma.

87
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:18,458
So we have three paths, as you know, in Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,125
The one is of bhakti.

89
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:28,166
Bhakti is where you sing the praise of God,

90
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,709
have devotion, do all kinds of rituals, everything

91
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:38,125
and you think that you are very close to God.

92
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:45,041
This is one which is being accepted

93
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,583
by many, many people and by many so-called religions,

94
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,709
that we must have complete dedication for God.

95
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,709
How did — you are not yet connected to God.

96
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,709
How, what are you doing? How can you have any dedication to God,

97
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,625
with whom you are not at all connected?

98
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:15,583
The second one was the karma,

99
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,709
that you do your work.

100
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,709
You go on doing your work

101
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,500
with a detached mind. I mean it’s not possible,

102
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:30,500
but that’s what they say and we are doing our karmas,

103
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:35,083
good karmas, we do all kinds of good things,

104
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:40,542
go to various places for our cleansing,

105
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:46,041
meet many great people of spirituality,

106
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:52,333
go to all various places and pray.

107
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:58,500
Visit all auspicious places which are being described.

108
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,083
All kinds of rituals, we do for that.

109
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,125
That is the karma yoga.

110
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:10,583
And that is what the karma yoga, according to us, is the right side.

111
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,583
Many people, as you know, are right-sided.

112
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:22,709
Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know,

113
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,125
full of ego, arrogance

114
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,625
and think  no end of themselves, very difficult to correct them.

115
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,125
They also never see anything wrong with them.

116
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:38,250
Whichever way they act, they think is all right.

117
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,542
That is the karma yoga,

118
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,041
but He has said that

119
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,583
whatever karmas you do,

120
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,667
whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say.

121
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:03,041
He said it in a very uncertain manner

122
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:09,542
because definitely, if He had said it with certainty,

123
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,083
people would never have understood Him.

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,417
So He said it is not possible that whatever karmas you are doing

125
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,375
could be the karmas

126
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,625
which will get you the blessings of the Divine....

127
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,542
(MARATHI)... He has said it.

128
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,500
So then, which karmas we should do?

129
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,583
Or should we give up all the karmas?

130
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,458
All the action, we should give up?

131
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,583
People were in two minds.

132
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:52,125
This is the style of Shri Krishna, is to put people in two minds

133
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,041
so they use their discretion.

134
00:10:55,458 --> 00:11:01,458
And third one is the discretion, which He calls as the Gnyanamarg,

135
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,500
is the central path, by which you evolve.

136
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,667
You evolve into a new state,

137
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:14,667
into a new state of your mind, a new state of your being,

138
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:20,291
by which you become

139
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:27,667
absolutely above every nonsense.

140
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:34,291
Also you are endowed with power to fight whatever is bad,

141
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:40,041
whatever is corrupting, whatever is killing this one.

142
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:48,291
At that stage, you are equipped with a  divine power

143
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:54,041
that you can finish off anything that is negative around you.

144
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:03,000
This is to be understood that that’s a state.

145
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:08,709
That’s not just talking. That’s not just believing that I am that,

146
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:14,667
but it’s a state. If you come up to that state

147
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,041
where you are beyond all these things

148
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:23,166
and you have all the knowledge, pure knowledge,

149
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,583
the subtle knowledge of being, this is the Gnyanamarg.

150
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,291
Many people say that

151
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:36,083
everybody cannot go to Gnyanamarg and, for that, you have to have a

152
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,625
special type of personality,

153
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,333
but this is very misleading.

154
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,291
Everyone can go into Gyanamarg.

155
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,417
It is very, very innately built within us,

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,250
this evolutionary attention, attainment.

157
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,375
It is within us and all of us can have that.

158
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:06,542
Only thing is we have no confidence perhaps

159
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,208
that we go on avoiding it

160
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:16,417
and go to cheaper things like becoming devoted to something,

161
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:22,125
doing some sort of a ritual, going to some sort of a holy place,

162
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:27,417
all kinds of nonsense, which doesn’t give you the evolutionary

163
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:35,667
ascent by which you know the knowledge,

164
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,583
the pure  knowledge, the real  knowledge.

165
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,625
So far, whatever you have known was written in the book,

166
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,417
whatever your parents told you,

167
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:50,583
or whatever you have explored outside.

168
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,417
But the knowledge which is the purest,

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,417
which is the real knowledge,

170
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:07,250
which is the gnyana, that you can only get through your ascent

171
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:14,083
and establish in yourself properly in that state.

172
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:18,041
If you go on denying it, you cannot make out.

173
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,208
But everyone has right to get it. You need not be educated,

174
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,083
you need not be a very simple person,

175
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,083
you need not be very rich or poor,

176
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,333
makes no difference,  as long as you are a human being

177
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,000
and a humble human being,

178
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,083
thinking that you have to achieve that state.

179
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,458
You all can get that state, which you know very well.

180
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:52,709
And at that state you become absolutely knowledgeable,

181
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,625
knowledgeable about yourself, knowledgeable about others,

182
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,625
knowledgeable about everything that goes around.

183
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:08,500
But this state must be maintained and try to go above that state

184
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,667
where you have no more doubts left in you.

185
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,250
This is what Shri Krishna taught

186
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,625
and this is what one has to achieve,

187
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,083
but He, being a diplomat, He tried to

188
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:29,291
tell you other stories. “Try this, try that, this, that.”

189
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:35,208
But actually what He has praised is gnyanamarg.

190
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,500
Ours is a gnyanamarg. That is the knowledge,

191
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,291
the path of knowledge in which you have to know all the knowledge.

192
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,667
Unless and until you have the whole knowledge,

193
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,041
you are not yet a gnyani, a person who knows.

194
00:15:56,208 --> 00:16:01,542
In this way, He has established that our evolutionary process

195
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:09,709
has to come beyond all other human awareness.

196
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,542
Other human awareness

197
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,625
is of a no value for a special  personality.

198
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:23,500
Now he knows something, say, ‘how many miles it is

199
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:28,500
from here say to New York or what trains go there’.

200
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,583
All this knowledge is not real

201
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:37,250
— ‘how much this cloth will cost, how much this carpet will cost,

202
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,166
in what shop you can get. All this knowledge

203
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,000
is just useless, is not the real knowledge.

204
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:51,250
Such a person doesn’t know this kind of knowledge,

205
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,667
but what he knows is the knowledge about your being,

206
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:01,208
knowledge about the whole universe,

207
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:07,208
which is not how many stars there are

208
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:12,500
or how many universes there are. No

209
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,709
it is the subtle inner

210
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,542
personality of everything, he knows.

211
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:28,333
In that subtlety, he discovers  so many new things

212
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:31,166
which he may not even heard about,

213
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:38,333
and, thus you reach a state of great knowledgeable personality.

214
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:44,625
This is what we have to achieve. We are born as human beings

215
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,125
and we know so many things already.

216
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,083
People know so many things, but they don’t know the actual.

217
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,458
This knowledge doesn’t come

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
through your reading or through your

219
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:04,166
intellectual pursuit or for your emotional movement — no.

220
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:12,041
It is shaswat.  It is all the time there.

221
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,667
It exists. It will exist.

222
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:22,125
And it is just to be understood, just to be

223
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,583
known to yourself what it is.

224
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:31,041
It cannot change. It cannot be remoulded.

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,041
It is what it is.

226
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,625
And that is what you know now.

227
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,208
Nobody would doubt that

228
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:50,291
because those who have got this state, they may doubt,

229
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,667
they may call you crazy, they may think anything,

230
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,625
but with the open eyes, whatever you say (is) the truth.

231
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:02,583
In the same way, with the open heart and a open brain, when you

232
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,625
know that, that is the real truth

233
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,166
and that is what is to be known.

234
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,583
For that, according to Shri Krishna,

235
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:20,208
you have to go through various tests.

236
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:25,500
One is you go on praying to Him.

237
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,709
He says, “You go on praying to Me

238
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,083
and if you give Me flowers I’ll take. If you give Me water I’ll take

239
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,291
Whatever you’ll give Me, I’ll take.”

240
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,208
He says clearly, but

241
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:53,166
what will you make out of that is very important.

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
He doesn’t say,

243
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:59,000
“If you give Me something, I’ll give you something.” That 's it.

244
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,625
So what should be the state?

245
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,375
What should be the condition? He said,

246
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,667
“If you praise Me, if you do bhakti for Me,

247
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,417
you are giving Me presents, you are doing all sorts of things,

248
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,458
you are very dedicated, but

249
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:28,000
you should do ananyabhakti. Word is ananya.

250
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,375
Ananya means when there is not the other,

251
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:38,250
when we are one, when we are connected,

252
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,041
then the bhakti you do that time,

253
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,125
whatever music you have of devotion,

254
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,458
whatever flowers you give,

255
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:51,375
whatever expression you have,

256
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,625
it should be ananya”.

257
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,041
That’s the word He said, that “Do ananya bhakti....

258
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,125
(MARATHI) ...whatever you give Me,  I’ll take”.

259
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:08,500
He’ll take everything. He’s the one who is the only,

260
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,417
Gopta means He is the only enjoyer.

261
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,166
“But what will you get,”

262
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:21,041
He says, “when you do ananyabhakti?”

263
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,250
Means ‘when you are one with Me.’

264
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,500
That means you are connected with Him.

265
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:35,333
That’s how He has explained bhakti, what is bhakti is very clearly.

266
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,583
But people don’t understand.

267
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,208
They think that bhakti means you go on singing

268
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,417
“Hari Rama, Hari Krishna,” this and that, is bhakti. Is not.

269
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:49,250
If that was real, they would have achieved something,

270
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,667
but they did not. Now don’t blame Krishna for that.

271
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,709
He has clearly said it should be ananyabhakti.

272
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,291
Only by changing your dress, wearing a particular

273
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,375
type of style, that’s not it. That’s all so outward.

274
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:15,083
It’s just to show off, but actually ananyabhakti is within yourself

275
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:19,625
when you are within that state when you are one with the Divine.

276
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:24,542
Unless and until that state you have achieved, not only that,

277
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:29,166
but have established, it doesn’t give you anything.

278
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,291
Many people have told Me, “We are doing so much

279
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,667
of bhakti yog, Mother. We don’t get anything.”

280
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,041
“Really, what sort of bhakti yog?”

281
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:44,625
We do — read Shri Krishna’s Gita.

282
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:50,333
Every morning (we) get up at four o’clock, take bath, read Krishna’s

283
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:55,458
Gita, do this, do that.Then we sing bhajans, this.

284
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,667
We never get anything.

285
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:05,500
So what is the reason?”

286
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,542
Reason is that you are not one with God.

287
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:17,500
And when you are one with God, then what does He give you?

288
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:26,291
He won’t give you cheap things which will vanish in no time,

289
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,542
but of some eternal nature. So He gives  you

290
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:37,709
peace, peace of the heart.He gives you balance.

291
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:45,583
Also He gives you a tranquil temperament,

292
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:55,667
joy of life. All these things are there within us

293
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,333
if we have the bhakti which is after being united,

294
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:08,041
after the yoga, with the Yogeshwara.

295
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:16,333
This is what one has to understand.Now, there are many karma yogis

296
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,667
who go on working mad, absolute madly.

297
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,625
They think we are doing, after all,

298
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:31,458
without any desire we are serving people,

299
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,625
we are serving the nation, we are serving this.

300
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,375
Ultimately, what do you get?

301
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:45,083
What you get may be money. Might be you might

302
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,333
get a good house, maybe all these things,

303
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,208
but you don’t get peace of heart.

304
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:57,500
You don’t get peace of mind. You don’t get that joy,

305
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:04,583
that joy which has no boundaries, which cannot be explained,

306
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,417
which cannot be described,

307
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,208
that boundless joy, you don’t have.

308
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:20,125
And you don’t get that eternal peace,

309
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,291
which can stop wars.

310
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,333
Completely, it can abolish this

311
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:31,709
cruel nature of human beings.

312
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:37,083
That you don’t get.  But apart from that,

313
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:41,375
you get the powers.

314
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,041
You get the knowledge —

315
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:48,542
knowledge, the subtle knowledge about everyone.

316
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:54,291
You know about everyone, where are they missing the point.

317
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,166
You know about yourself and about others.

318
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:05,166
This knowledge you get, not in the college or in the schools,

319
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,667
but within yourself is the ocean of knowledge

320
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:15,583
and whichever way you want to see, whichever you want to achieve,

321
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,709
is there, there present.

322
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:25,542
That is what is the real knowledge, what we call

323
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,667
that you achieve through the

324
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:32,625
sukshagnyana means the subtle knowledge,

325
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,333
knowledge about chakras, knowledge

326
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:42,041
about the universe. Everything you can get out of this.

327
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:48,208
But then you get more interested in giving knowledge to others.

328
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,625
You don’t want to know so many thing then.

329
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,625
What is the need to know about banking,

330
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:02,250
say, about who is the richest man in the whole world?

331
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:07,709
All these things you don’t want to know. Your whole attitude changes

332
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:14,542
and what you get is nothing but a kind of a tranquil mind

333
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,542
which knows everything that is to be known..

334
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,709
That is what one has to achieve

335
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:28,458
Now this country of yours, America, is very kharmakandi.

336
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:33,500
It goes on doing work, work, work. They’re workaholics.

337
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,542
They work so hard and what do you get?

338
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,709
You get children who are drug addicts.

339
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,250
You get wives who are running here and there.

340
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:51,291
You get broken families and no peace.

341
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,375
You support wars.

342
00:27:56,458 --> 00:28:03,500
Only thing is that so far this country is being protected in a way,

343
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:09,208
but also you have destroyed so many aboriginals,

344
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:14,500
so many fundamental things that you should have preserved.

345
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,500
A day may come when they will realise

346
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:23,125
that this is what they have been doing and this was really wrong.

347
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:29,667
A day will come when we’ll have so many Realised Souls in America.

348
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:37,709
But just now the situation is (that) the people are just gone

349
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:42,709
mad with the idea of making money

350
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,375
and they discover that ‘Now no more, finished.

351
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:55,083
So now what to do?’ What to do? Come to Sahaja Yoga.

352
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:03,333
Do Sahaj Yoga and then you will get the treasures of your being

353
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:09,125
which are within you, which will give you all the comfort,

354
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:15,625
all the joy and all the supremacy that any

355
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:20,333
amount of money, any amount of power can’t give.

356
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,041
This is what we have to do,

357
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:29,208
is to take to Sahaja Yoga and make others also Sahaja Yogis

358
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:34,542
so that they also get that peace, joy and satisfaction;

359
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:39,583
and this madness of running from one thing to another

360
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:45,083
will be finished because you can never be satisfied with that.

361
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:49,458
Want to buy today one thing, then tomorrow want another thing,

362
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:53,583
then want to doing another thing. You are never satisfied.

363
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,166
You don’t get any joy out of what you are desiring.

364
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:04,041
So your pure desire, it should be to be one with the Divine.

365
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,250
That is how it will work out.

366
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,083
Shri Krishna’s specialty was that

367
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,709
He always supported people who were Realised Souls,

368
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,208
who were on the right path, who were doing righteous things.

369
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,709
He would never support anybody

370
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:30,291
who may be well off, who may be great thing.

371
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,583
Like a great king was Duryodhana.

372
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,625
He invited Shri Krishna to his house,

373
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:44,333
to his big palace to be his guest.

374
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,417
Shri Krishna said, “I am sorry.” He went to Vidura,

375
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:58,583
who was the son of a maid, Dasaputra,

376
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:06,500
because Vidura was a Realised Soul. Because he was a Realised Soul,

377
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:11,125
to Him he was much higher, much greater

378
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,709
than Duryodhana – who was a ruler because he was a crook,

379
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,458
because he was a bad man.

380
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:22,333
So the discrimination between good and bad

381
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,000
becomes one in your mind,

382
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:32,500
becomes one of your inner temperament,

383
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:37,208
then you are always very much satisfied

384
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:42,417
because you know you are not been doing

385
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,458
something that is wrong.

386
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,709
The discrimination is the gift of Shri Krishna.

387
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:58,083
Apart from anything else, He gives us the gift of discrimination.

388
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:06,417
That is His style, I should say, to teach you how to discriminate

389
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:12,083
and then you become experts on discrimination, on vibrations.

390
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:18,166
On vibrations, you can judge everything so clearly,

391
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,166
so beautifully.  Others may not agree with you,

392
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,709
that’s a different point; but you know

393
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,709
what is right and what is wrong.

394
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:31,250
And that is what Shri Krishna’s gift is.

395
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:37,250
As it is, you know He is controlling sixteen sub-chakras within us.

396
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:44,208
He controls everything. He controls your throat, nose, eyes, ears.

397
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:51,709
All these things He controls, but ultimately, what does He say?

398
00:32:54,667 --> 00:33:00,250
He says He is the Virat. Virat means the one who is the great,

399
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:05,291
great lord,

400
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:12,542
what we call “akbar” and that’s what in the Muslim

401
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:17,250
thing  they accept that Allahu Akbar.

402
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:20,375
I mean, because it is in a poetry, it’s partly

403
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:25,333
clear, partly not clear, but He was a Virata

404
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,625
and He showed His form to Arjuna

405
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:36,250
and Arjuna was amazed to see His form, that He’s the Virata.

406
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:42,500
He’s the one who is great, absorbing everything

407
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:46,500
and He’s the one who is taking out everything.

408
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:53,208
He’s a Yama. He is the one who is the god of death.

409
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:58,667
He’s so many. You know His names are there written down.

410
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,250
All these powers are with you,

411
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:07,041
which He uses wherever it is needed.

412
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:12,166
So the Sahaja Yogis first have the power of satisfaction.

413
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,625
It’s tremendous practice, satisfaction.

414
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,583
Imagine in this place,

415
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:22,291
you are all enjoying so much, you are living here so happy.

416
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:25,166
Shows what? You are so satisfied.

417
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,208
Otherwise nobody would like.

418
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,625
They would say, “No, we want some nice place. What is this?

419
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:35,166
We don’t want to live here with everyone.” But to live with others,

420
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:39,583
this collectivity also is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

421
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:45,291
He teaches you to be collective, the fun of collectivity,

422
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,709
the enjoyment of collectivity. A person who is secluded,

423
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,625
who keeps himself off like a drunkard

424
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:56,041
is not  the one who worships Shri Krishna.

425
00:34:56,291 --> 00:35:00,291
The one who is one with Shri Krishna enjoys everyone

426
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:05,125
who are there, specially if they are all Realised Souls,

427
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,291
that person enjoys their company very much.

428
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:13,417
That is something so easily understood in your lives

429
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:17,542
if you see how you live happily, morally,

430
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,041
absolutely perfect; in no way you do anything immoral

431
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:29,208
steal anything or have bad feelings for other people.

432
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,208
It’s something surprising that has happened to you,

433
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:34,709
that you are all living so happily

434
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:39,583
in one place together with satya.

435
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:45,291
His collectivity is to be understood

436
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,208
because I always say

437
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:51,375
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America.

438
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:55,166
America is also very collective.

439
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:58,709
Like it will be interested in every country.

440
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,667
It will be bothered about everyone,

441
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,500
but in a wrong way tries to help.

442
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,291
Always it is never in the right way.

443
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,208
Now, supposing there is a country where

444
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,500
they are producing a lot of drugs.

445
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:17,625
Why not invade that country, instead of invading other countries.

446
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:22,041
He’s like that. Discrimination is missing.

447
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:25,125
Unless and until you have that,

448
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,458
you cannot use your power of collectivity properly.

449
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:32,542
Though they are collective, but what collective work have they done?

450
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:36,500
Even now, they want to say they are separate, they are different.

451
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,333
“Whatever problems we are facing are our own.”

452
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:45,417
So this collectivity has been so much minimised

453
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:48,458
in a country of Shri Krishna itself.

454
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,125
Though they have that within themselves,

455
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:56,208
a feeling that they should talk about every country,

456
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:59,125
they should give lead to every country,

457
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:02,083
they should consult every country, but

458
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:07,125
always take a wrong decision about those countries.

459
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:11,041
This comes because they are not discriminating.

460
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,041
They should be discriminating.

461
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:18,667
So many things can be said about Vishuddhi chakra,

462
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:25,667
but specially I am more concerned about two chakras on two sides.

463
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:30,291
One of them is, as you know, is the Lalita chakra on left side

464
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
and Shri chakra on the right side.

465
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:36,166
I’ve always told ladies that

466
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,542
please keep this covered.

467
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,083
It looks so simple. It’s very important.

468
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:48,417
Don’t expose this because power of this should be preserved —

469
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:54,208
Shri chakra and Lalita chakra, they’re very important.

470
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,583
They are, I should say, feminine powers

471
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:02,375
and they are the feminine powers of Shri Krishna,

472
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:08,709
which must be understood that whatever way you respect your body,

473
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:13,667
that is the way your chakras are and that is the way you suffer.

474
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,667
For example, (if) you do not respect Shri Ganesha, you will suffer.

475
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,375
And if you respect Ganesha and do not behave in a manner

476
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:28,333
that you should behave, you will suffer. You’ll have problems.

477
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,500
So the whole body reacts.

478
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:40,125
Body reacts to outside influences in such a manner

479
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,542
that you start seeing there is something wrong

480
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:49,250
somewhere and that’s why you behave like this.

481
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:02,083
Apart from that, eyes are supplied by this chakra,

482
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:11,375
so when you look at something, it should be very pure glance.

483
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,583
The purer it is, the better you will enjoy.

484
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:20,583
But if the glance is not pure,

485
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:26,583
is shifty, going from here to there, there to there,

486
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:34,542
then you are actually going against your dharma,

487
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,041
against your evolutionary process and one day will come

488
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,500
when you might become blind, you might develop cataracts.

489
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,291
You might develop all kinds of diseases of the eyes,

490
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:53,208
which are very important to pay attention to it.

491
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,291
Then this connect(ion) also goes to the tongue.

492
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,125
The tongue is looked after,

493
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,166
but those people have a very bad habit

494
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:12,417
of suddenly saying horrible things, of suddenly saying

495
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:18,333
very bad words or sometimes getting after somebody

496
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,166
with the very bad remarks.

497
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,709
All such things are very bad for the tongue

498
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:28,000
and this is what Shri Krishna doesn’t like.

499
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:33,083
In case you use your tongue for saying harsh things to others,

500
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:39,333
being sarcastic, being harsh on others,

501
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,417
using abusive word,

502
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:48,583
your tongue, one day, I don’t know how it will react.

503
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:52,417
It will react in different ways.

504
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,667
God knows, it might become thick. It won’t move.

505
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,625
God knows, it might be sucked inside.

506
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,250
That’s the physical side of it, but also mental side of it,

507
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:06,291
that you will [not] know what you are talking about.

508
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,458
If you say something, you’ll say something else.

509
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:15,083
It’s possible with your tongue. It’s quite possible

510
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:20,208
that we may not be able to talk, may not be able to say anything.

511
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:27,083
Anything is possible if you try to trouble

512
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,250
your tongue like that, using it for wrong purposes.

513
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:40,083
Tongue is not for being used for

514
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:46,166
abusive things,as well as for — some people try to be

515
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:51,250
extra kind and gentle and this and that

516
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,458
to achieve some ends.

517
00:41:55,417 --> 00:42:00,041
This kind of thing also is very, very much — is dangerous

518
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,083
for the tongue and you might develop blisters on your tongue

519
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:08,125
to such an extent that people who even

520
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:12,000
go on saying harsh things to others and all that

521
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,291
can develop a kind of a cancer.

522
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:23,417
Some people think that if you bear up everything is good. Is not.

523
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,667
If somebody is trying to oppress you, don’t try to bear it.

524
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:33,333
Throw it away because if you bear also,

525
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:37,583
you can move to the left and you can get horrible things

526
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:42,041
like cancer. You can get cancer.

527
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:45,709
Those who are aggressive, they can get also diseases;

528
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,709
and those (who) are very much, I should say,

529
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,291
bearing type also get into trouble.

530
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:57,417
So you should be in a balanced state,

531
00:42:58,083 --> 00:43:00,250
should not accept anything.

532
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:04,542
Supposing anybody calls you name just keep quiet look at that person

533
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,667
that’s all. Know that he’s a stupid fool.

534
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,208
But don’t accept it.

535
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,458
If you accept it and go on crying about it and weeping about it,

536
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:19,166
then you can get cancer. But supposing

537
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,375
somebody says something, you should know (he) is a stupid fool,

538
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,500
just keep out of it, then nothing can happen.

539
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:32,000
So both ways one has to be careful because Krishna is

540
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:36,375
playing around and He sees how far you can go.

541
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:44,667
Now throat — throat is very important. We should look after it.

542
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,250
Those people who shout,

543
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,625
scream ultimately can lose their power of speech,

544
00:43:57,709 --> 00:44:04,000
can become frantic with their problems of the throat,

545
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:07,625
specially throat can develop horrible disease

546
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:14,125
by which you just — they can just get swollen up.

547
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,625
We call it snake disease

548
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:25,125
and you feel suffocated. So when you talk to someone, talk clearly,

549
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:31,375
in a sweet manner, but don’t shout at the person, never.

550
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,625
Neither you try to show peevishness in your speech.

551
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:40,542
If you are peevish, then cancer can set in.

552
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,625
So both ways you have to be careful, as you are Sahaja Yogis.

553
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:47,000
You have to have this knowledge,

554
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:51,208
that you will not do, bear anything nonsensical if anybody speaks —

555
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,000
means you should not accept it.

556
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,500
One may say something to you. It’s all right.

557
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:59,041
And sometimes you should tell him off

558
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,625
that “You were saying like this, (it) is not so.”

559
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:06,583
It’s best is not to bear it up and to suffer.

560
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:09,709
You’re not Christ. You don’t have His powers.

561
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,667
Because if you do that, you’ll develop cancer.

562
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:19,083
So try to be in a way just in the centre,

563
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:23,583
watching everything, if there’s aggression

564
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,125
or if there’s recession (reception) —one of the two things

565
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:32,542
you must not give in to any of these attitudes,

566
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,542
but develop an attitude  of standing

567
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,709
very firmly on your own grounds.

568
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:43,625
For example, there was a Chinese story I read

569
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:48,166
that there once — a king wanted his

570
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:51,083
two cocks to win in a race,

571
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:54,625
so they said you send them to a sage and train them up.

572
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:59,208
So he has sent them to a sage. They were trained very well.

573
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:05,250
And when they were brought, they stood in the arena

574
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:09,625
and many cocks were there, who started attacking them,

575
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:13,458
but these two were standing like this, least bothered.

576
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:18,333
They tried and tried, but these two were standing like this.

577
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,000
As a result, all of them ran away.

578
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:26,250
So that’s what is the character you should have.

579
00:46:26,709 --> 00:46:30,125
Is not to bend to something because somebody is aggressive

580
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,709
and also not to aggress others,

581
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:40,583
not to torture other, not to sit on somebody’s head.

582
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:43,542
It’s very, very dangerous  for your throat

583
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,417
and such a throat will always, will always be in danger

584
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,208
of getting some horrible diseases.

585
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:55,583
All this I’ve told you because so many things we know about,

586
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,583
we should reach it. We have

587
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:02,125
— but we have very subtle knowledge about  Vishuddhi chakra.

588
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:04,375
We should also have little gross,

589
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:06,709
that what can happen to our Vishuddhi chakra

590
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,166
if we try not to look after it.

591
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:17,500
So this is what is Shri Krishna’s work. Also teeth He looks after.

592
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,250
Ears He looks after. You know what is to be done

593
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:28,083
about the teeth and the ears. These are His own sixteen —

594
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:35,458
we can say — works. We can call them as karias, sixteen

595
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:40,166
on which He works on different, different levels.

596
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:45,625
And you must try to develop our powers of our

597
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:52,375
Vishuddhi chakra by so many ways and

598
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:57,333
so many exercises, by understanding

599
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,542
what goes wrong with us when we do not understand

600
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:06,000
and value our Vishuddhi chakra.

601
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,583
Now America is the Vishuddhi of the whole world,

602
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:15,625
so it is very important that the people who are in charge here

603
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:20,667
should know all the powers of Vishuddhi,

604
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,709
plus how to preserve it

605
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:28,667
and how to expand it

606
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,333
to the whole world. With these two hands

607
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,667
also are from Vishuddhi chakra

608
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:39,083
and, with that, you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

609
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,667
You have to go to different worlds, different countries,

610
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,625
to — even to small villages you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

611
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,709
Only in the hands first, you see the cool breeze.

612
00:48:54,458 --> 00:49:01,208
That means it is you feel the universal

613
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:06,458
power of the Divine in your life.

614
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:10,250
So this is the collective, universal love

615
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:13,667
that comes to your hand and teaches you.

616
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:17,542
So it’s such an important chakra is this.

617
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,250
In the same way, America’s very important

618
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,542
and, as citizens of America, you should try

619
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:28,333
to maintain the religion the dharma here

620
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,709
and to create a great understanding

621
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:39,709
for world problems and try to give love

622
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:44,709
to all the people from whatever country they will be coming.

623
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,709
May God bless you all.
