00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:28,180
Shri Hanuman puja. Pune (India), 31 March 1999.

2
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:08,775
Today we are celebrating Jayanti (Birth Anniversary) of Hanumanji.

3
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:20,405
What should we say about Hanumanji!

4
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:28,607
He was so powerful and wise.

5
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:36,436
He was equally devoted and dedicated.

6
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:47,194
Generally such a powerful person becomes right sided.

7
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:51,773
He considers Himself so dignified that

8
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:59,053
 He doesn't give any importance to anyone in His comparison.

9
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:10,901
But Hanumanji is a special Deity.

10
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:19,190
A special deity full of qualities that as much strong He was

11
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:26,545
as much powerful He was as much was His devotion.

12
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,130
An embodiment of balanced strength

13
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:34,974
He had as much power, as He had devotion.

14
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:51,072
How did He maintain this balance?

15
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:56,781
And was steady in it  is worth understanding.

16
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,230
In Sahaja yoga, when we are enlightened

17
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:12,171
and in Sahaja yoga we get many powers

18
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:17,528
simultaneously, we get balance.

19
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:23,615
We love others.

20
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:30,199
With love and with the help of the power of Love

21
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:35,420
we get busy in our work and go on doing our work.

22
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:39,544
In this way, Shree Hanumanji

23
00:07:39,815 --> 00:07:42,223
was very powerful.

24
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,853
He had Divine powers

25
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,585
He had NAVADHA (Special) powers.

26
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,137
which are called GARIMA, LAGHUMA.

27
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,762
He could become as big as He wanted to be

28
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,101
or as minute as He wanted to be

29
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,263
and as small as an atom.

30
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,894
All these powers

31
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:09,332
He got through His devotion.

32
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:13,361
It means that devotion and power

33
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:15,868
are both the same.

34
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,602
He who has power

35
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:23,776
and doesn't have devotion, becomes a Rakshasa (Demon).

36
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,198
And He who has devotion

37
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:30,945
but doesn't have power, becomes mad.

38
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:36,660
Between both these, he who is in the central path

39
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:49,412
attains this state which you may call power, or devotion.

40
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:53,900
Each part of his body is made of that.

41
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:03,352
Because of His this special feature today we worship Bajrang Bali

42
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:10,218
in our motherland as well as in foreign countries.

43
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,639
I am so surprised

44
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:16,714
that the young boys, children of foreign countries,

45
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:19,583
when they draw any picture

46
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:24,438
first of all they draw Hanumanji’s picture.

47
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,459
Next, His special quality

48
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:34,680
was that He was half man and half monkey.

49
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:44,452
Means, it was a perfect combination of animal and human being.

50
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:58,387
So within us, whatever we have lost  in our evolution

51
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:08,183
in that, the element of love and attachment that was what he

52
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,678
took with him.

53
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:23,906
For example, you see that guru's enamored path is believed

54
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:32,873
in which of guru's  which creatures are considered as attendants.

55
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,783
That is why they consider dogs.

56
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,760
A dog has that quality

57
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:47,346
that like a guru's disciple is fully dedicated

58
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:53,686
and has no other master except his guru

59
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:58,526
and has no other thought.

60
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:04,040
Every time,  he sacrifices his life for his master.

61
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:08,922
In the same way, it should be understood that

62
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:13,630
a creature who has been brought up in evolution

63
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,726
 when he comes in contact with a human being,

64
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:21,555
what he learns, is full devotion.

65
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:29,423
 It means, devotion is innately born within us.

66
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:40,355
The seed of devotion is beforehand completely sown within us.

67
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:46,689
 When we were not in this state, not in the human state

68
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:51,414
 the emergence of devotion was more at that time.

69
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:56,000
Devotion set its roots deeply in us.

70
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:59,214
 Take an example of any animal.

71
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,049
You get a little love from him,

72
00:12:02,074 --> 00:12:05,430
 give him a little love, a little fondness for him

73
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:11,107
 he gets so close to you, gives his regard to you

74
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:15,501
 and in this way loves you.

75
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,774
You must have heard about a horse too

76
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:23,743
 that when a horse's rider falls down

77
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:28,684
 or is about to die, he remains loyal to him.

78
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:43,169
In the same way it is said about elephants.

79
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,899
 The elephants' determination too is terrific.

80
00:12:48,924 --> 00:12:55,975
They never put their master to any trouble

81
00:12:56,554 --> 00:13:09,144
 and if a lion or any other animal attacks their master

82
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,183
 the elephant will better die while going on fighting

83
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,560
 but he will not allow his master to be touched.

84
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:25,110
This relation of a master and superior and high-quality animals

85
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:31,591
 this relation is established within us beforehand.

86
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,957
And along with this relationship we get that power as well.

87
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:40,780
 For example, I told you that

88
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:43,499
 the elephant will die while going on fighting in the battlefield.

89
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,879
The elephant gets this power of fighting too

90
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:51,306
 because of his love and devotion.

91
00:13:55,832 --> 00:14:05,740
We say that Sahaj yoga is the work of love and Divine love is true.

92
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:11,784
 But while doing this work, that power is also inherent in it.

93
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:19,397
We may or may not know it,

94
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,186
 we may or may not have any knowledge of that

95
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:32,362
 but that also is inherent in it, and that is Divine power.

96
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:39,783
Man's bowing down before anyone

97
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:45,249
 to respect anyone, to consider anyone great

98
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:48,545
 all these are the indications of that.

99
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:55,785
But when he respects his master, then within him

100
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:58,907
there is importance to his master

101
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:03,749
 but along with that is his power as well.

102
00:15:04,176 --> 00:15:07,806
So, devotion and power are not two different things.

103
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,522
 They are just one and the same.

104
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:14,890
We will say that if there is power in the right hand

105
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,759
 there is devotion in the left hand.

106
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:20,529
This fusion of power and devotion

107
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:25,700
 has been described beautifully in Shree Hanumanji.

108
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:31,445
On the one hand He went burn Ravan's Lanka

109
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:38,206
and there only He prostrated before Sitaji.

110
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:44,687
 And when Sitaji said ''No, you are My son

111
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,902
 I will not come at the behest of My son.

112
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:50,782
My husband will have to come and will have to destroy this man.

113
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:58,755
 When He will destroy him (Ravana), then I will go with Him."

114
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:02,963
Hanumanji said, “That is okay!"

115
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,727
 He could have picked Her up like that only.

116
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:09,375
He had such powers.

117
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:17,665
 But He said,"If Mother is saying so, it is okay."

118
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:21,929
And after that, such a great war broke out.

119
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:25,405
 There was a need for that.

120
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:30,441
Now there were special qualities of Shri Ram.

121
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:33,794
 Extremely powerful!

122
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:38,218
And His aim would never go astray.

123
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:44,461
 You must have heard what He did in Sita Swayamvar.

124
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:47,231
But the same Shri Ram

125
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:52,867
 when it was the case of Ravana

126
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:56,481
 He didn't give up.

127
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,348
He killed Him.

128
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:08,592
 Tulsidas ji has given a beautiful description of this scene.

129
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:15,141
Then Shri Ram was repeatedly hitting the arrows

130
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:20,761
 at Ravana's ten heads.

131
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,500
The heads would fall down one by one but get back again,

132
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:25,335
 fall down and get back again.

133
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:31,283
Then Laxman said ,"what are You doing?

134
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:34,476
 Shoot one arrow in His heart,

135
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:38,394
the moment You will hit an arrow in His heart

136
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,069
 instantly He will die

137
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,994
 Otherwise, how can He die ?

138
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,870
He cannot die."

139
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:49,489
 The arrow should hit His heart.

140
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,695
There is a beautiful description of Shri Ram there.

141
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,705
 He was a shy person, very shy.

142
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:05,043
Shri Ram, even though He was so powerful, so intense

143
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,089
 even though He was such a noble person

144
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:12,310
 He said, " You see the problem is that

145
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:17,282
 in Ravan's heart resides My Sita.

146
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,800
So, I won't hit Him in his heart.

147
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,745
 But when his head will cut off repeatedly

148
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,084
 his attention will surely shift towards his head.

149
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,996
At that time I will kill him with an arrow."

150
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:34,983
 Otherwise for Him, it would be said

151
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,494
that he would kill a person just with one arrow.

152
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,346
 But now you see how delicate the matter is.

153
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:46,875
Simply, it is a husband's love towards his wife.

154
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:55,547
 Even though being an ocean of power, what an amount of love He had!

155
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:01,152
There are many instances of Hanumanji

156
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:13,398
 in which Hanumanji proved that He is ocean of love

157
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:18,894
 and at the same time, he who is evil minded

158
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,773
 he who bothers others, he who destroys others

159
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:33,633
 he doesn't hesitate in any way to kill him.

160
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:42,533
As all this fact is about Hanuman's devotion

161
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:48,239
 the same is worth noticing about his power of strength.

162
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:56,542
He knew that Ravana was afraid only of fire.

163
00:19:58,904 --> 00:20:01,970
 So, He went to Lanka and set it on fire.

164
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:08,879
This was His power that He put Lanka on fire.

165
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,805
 And in that fire, He didn't kill anyone, He did not burn anyone.

166
00:20:16,305 --> 00:20:18,948
Ravana also did not get burnt,  nobody got burnt

167
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,989
 but he got scared.

168
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:26,795
People got scared, as to what crime Ravana is doing.

169
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:32,540
 People had given full consent about
 the type of deeds Ravana was doing.

170
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:38,411
They would say, "He is Ravana. it is his will.

171
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,783
 Whatever he wants to do, let him do. Who are we to question him?

172
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:46,444
Ravana is after all Ravana."

173
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:54,860
 But it is worth noticing that when Lanka was on fire

174
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:59,034
 when Lanka was completely combusted

175
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:06,187
 people understood that it was a dangerous situation

176
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:14,135
 because Lanka was put on fire and we too could be burnt.

177
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:18,800
The quality of fire is that it goes upwards, doesn't come downwards.

178
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,488
 Everybody was watching upwards that it was burning.

179
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:27,975
Whole of Lanka was combusted but nobody got burnt.

180
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:33,110
 He did so to frighten them

181
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:39,885
 to make them understand that Ravana is committing a great sin.

182
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:46,516
How much understanding and how much balanced was Bajrang Bali

183
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,512
should be noted.

184
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:52,612
 The same we come across in History.

185
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:59,675
All those who were very powerful had immense love.

186
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:05,316
 If you observe an example, there is an example of Shivaji Maharaj.

187
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:12,562
He was as powerful as He was well behaved,

188
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:19,502
 very disciplined and very well balanced.

189
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:26,991
When you get this balance, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

190
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,799
 If you get the power, it doesn't mean

191
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:39,868
 that you in your love and your dealings you somehow give up.

192
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:46,249
But you are powerful and its beauty is that

193
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:52,383
 those who are Schedule caste, poor and unhappy

194
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:56,281
 those who are victims, those who are facing disaster

195
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:57,840
are secured.........

196
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:03,474
And those who are troubling them

197
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,946
those who are destroying, those who are bothering

198
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:12,179
have created  problems for people

199
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:15,401
to such people

200
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,224
there is no need to do anything.

201
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,530
You can set them right only with the help of bandhans.

202
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:25,830
The powers that you have received inside your being

203
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:29,140
it should be used for this very purpose

204
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:35,879
so that the evil will be destroyed.

205
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:40,399
But in your power there is no sword

206
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:43,536
or mace in your hand like Hanumanji.

207
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:50,507
Mace is not outwardly but it is inside.

208
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,220
You watch your experiences

209
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:02,546
that he who bothers or disturbs, he is attacked by a mace

210
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,533
you may or may not pick a mace in your hand.

211
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,276
In this way you yourself are safe by default

212
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,065
your safety is  guaranteed

213
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:31,522
 but along with that your other sahaja yogis too are safe.

214
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:37,461
Now in this Shri Bajrangbali has a great role to play.

215
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:39,017
You don't know

216
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:42,846
that he is standing in front of you as well as at your back.

217
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:51,508
His nature is just like children

218
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:58,849
Too pure and too simple

219
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:04,008
but such wisdom

220
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:09,889
and all types of virtues He knows.

221
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:15,726
It means that along with His power

222
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:25,567
 He has a lot of absolute discretion- very wise.

223
00:25:26,427 --> 00:25:29,659
The wisdom of the present time is useless

224
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,378
but the wisdom

225
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:35,351
that will scrutinize and understand everything with love

226
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:43,444
a special form of that wisdom

227
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:51,003
 was Shri Ganesha and is Shri Hanumana.

228
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:59,594
The speciality of both of them is that

229
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:09,011
 Hanumanji is very strong, very quick deity

230
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:13,710
 and Shri Ganesha is very cool.

231
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:23,216
But both are great destructors in times of need.

232
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:26,983
 For Sahaja Yogis there is no need of destruction.

233
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,136
There is no need to destroy anyone.

234
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,837
You just think

235
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:41,443
that both of them are with you at every moment.

236
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:46,209
Whenever anyone bothers you

237
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:53,385
in reality, your protectors are standing with you.

238
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:57,309
Many times, you must be noticing

239
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:04,655
 that ministers or anyone visits a place, security escorts them.

240
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:10,631
Sahaja Yogis' security always escorts them.

241
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:19,576
 The other security with them is that of Ganas.

242
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:26,767
Now their work is too diversified

243
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:30,635
miscellaneous and little job work also.

244
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:34,171
 And these only

245
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:41,080
 give a message about you to Shri Ganesha who is Ganapati

246
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:42,105
 about what is going on?

247
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,868
What wrong is going on and where?

248
00:27:43,893 --> 00:27:47,023
 From where you are being attacked ?

249
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:51,161
And from where you are troubled?

250
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,136
you may not even be knowing.

251
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:58,533
Somebody may like to attack you in an unknown form

252
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:04,943
even then both these deities are standing with you

253
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:10,425
 and when Ganapati tells this

254
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:14,093
 Shri Hanuman gets ready.

255
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:18,005
Sahaja Yogis need not be afraid of anything.

256
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:20,847
 No need to be afraid of anything

257
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:22,817
 Right now I am going to tell you a Story.

258
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,932
It is so amazing.

259
00:28:24,957 --> 00:28:37,023
You must have heard that America exploded a lot of bombs everywhere

260
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:46,158
 thinking that terrorists have made some arrangements.

261
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:53,941
The story I am going to tell you is about a place in Africa.

262
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:59,295
 Here were some Sahaja Yogis and a bomb exploded there.

263
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:05,596
Because of that bomb explosion, all the people died

264
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,554
 and Sahaja Yogis remained unhurt.

265
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,107
They were so surprised.

266
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,828
 Even the dust did not touch them.

267
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:17,859
They had never come to Cabella.

268
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,384
They had never thought that they would ever come to Cabella.

269
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:25,275
But when it took place, they came to Cabella.

270
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:31,068
 And after coming said,''Mother, don't know who saved us

271
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,597
 who protected us.''

272
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:40,186
But all Sahaja Yogis were saved and the rest of the people died...

273
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:50,308
Now it is an incident, it is true.

274
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:57,884
And its reason is this that you have now recognized God.

275
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:09,033
You have enlightened your soul in Sahaja Marga.

276
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:24,330
 With this new transformation

277
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:36,083
 you have become a great devotee and a powerful human being.

278
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,801
Now it is not at all possible for anyone to touch you.

279
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:44,696
I can give you hundreds of such examples

280
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:48,091
 that when you get your realization in Sahaja

281
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:54,449
 nobody can touch you.

282
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,371
Previously also there were saints.

283
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:01,959
 All of them were tortured, victimized, everything happened.

284
00:31:02,513 --> 00:31:09,309
But in spite of being victimized or tortured, they didn't give up

285
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,716
 and not only this, they were always protected.

286
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:20,928
And they would talk about such things
 which would make people very angry.

287
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:23,317
 They would think, what are they talking

288
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:28,141
 against kings, against emperors and against everybody.

289
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:32,364
They would talk about such things which would scare people

290
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:37,423
 but because of Hanumanji's powers, nobody could touch them.

291
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,537
Nobody hit them.

292
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,571
 There is a nice story about Khwaja Nizzamudin Saheb.

293
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:53,303
That his king told him to bow down before him ..[unclear]..

294
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,664
He didn't bow down.

295
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:58,695
He said, "No, I am not going to bow down before you. Who are you?''

296
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:01,094
He was very angry.

297
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,441
He said that if within three days

298
00:32:03,466 --> 00:32:06,670
you do not come and bow down before me

299
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:09,360
 I will get your neck cut off''.

300
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:11,132
He said,'' Ok, get it cut off!

301
00:32:11,157 --> 00:32:12,592
I won't

302
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:16,922
because you are not a great saint that i will bow down before you.''

303
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:25,798
Then he came and raised a great commotion

304
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:30,563
that after three days this man's neck is to be cut off.

305
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:33,894
The day his neck was going to be cut off

306
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,093
 that night only, this King's neck got cut off, nobody knows how?

307
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:47,861
If this would not have been in history, those who were great saints

308
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:53,958
 those who were great followers of dharma, would have been no more.

309
00:32:54,764 --> 00:33:01,054
Because Rakshas's ways are so powerful and violent

310
00:33:01,445 --> 00:33:09,084
 and are so comprehensive that
 they would have surely put an end to them.

311
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:16,519
But behind them is God.

312
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,181
 And God is on one side Hanuman and on another side Ganesha.

313
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:26,442
He is made of these two powers together.

314
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:31,775
 He is a protector, He takes care.

315
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:38,119
There is a story of Rana Pratap of Mewar

316
00:33:38,932 --> 00:33:41,827
 that when he went to fight a war,

317
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:49,022
his soldiers thought that he was going to be defeated.

318
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:49,880
So, they told him

319
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,372
 ''You return back

320
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,716
 because we want that your life should be saved

321
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,040
 for the sake of Mewar."

322
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:57,761
He didn't listen.

323
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:00,220
 He said,"All of you better go back.

324
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,923
I will stay put like this

325
00:34:02,948 --> 00:34:05,939
 because the Ganas are standing with me."

326
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:07,989
He too was a Sahaja Yogi.

327
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:11,141
 "If you want to go, you go.

328
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,129
I will stay here like this, only

329
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,973
 because the Ganas are with me."

330
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:19,212
Just understand that

331
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:23,891
 you have every type of protection in your front and back.

332
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:34,918
But just on getting this protection

333
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,749
what should a man have? What should a Sahaja Yogi have?

334
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:46,325
A very serious and determined person, and not afraid of anyone.

335
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:55,121
 He doesn't run away from anyone.

336
00:34:56,269 --> 00:35:00,222
He sticks at that place

337
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:11,406
 and those who are evil persons,in front of him.

338
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,066
He doesn't need to do anything.

339
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,123
 That period is over.

340
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:26,908
Now you just stand at a place and the other person will run away.

341
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:29,018
 He won't come to know what happened.

342
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:34,436
Sahaja Yogis write and send about many such experiences

343
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:38,885
that happened like this and that.

344
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:43,429
Otherwise in the presence of these foreigners

345
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:47,196
 it is not so easy to spread Sahaja Yoga.

346
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:51,572
And since Sahaja Yoga has started spreading among Muslims too

347
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:53,924
you can understand that

348
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:57,553
that this Divine power which is the power of love,

349
00:35:57,578 --> 00:35:59,856
how much strength it has within it

350
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:05,461
and how many tasks can be done with the help of it.

351
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,069
 But it doesn't mean that

352
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:19,188
you make any harassment in the name of Hanumanji.

353
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:21,947
It doesn't at all mean that.

354
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:24,104
For example nowadays, there are such (organizations)

355
00:36:24,196 --> 00:36:27,174
which  take the name of Hanumanji, take the name of Ganesh ji

356
00:36:27,246 --> 00:36:33,299
or of Mahadevji and make such organizations.

357
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,915
There is no need of making any organization.

358
00:36:37,508 --> 00:36:40,704
You yourself are an organization.

359
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:43,830
Neither anybody can touch you

360
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:49,271
nor, anyone can destroy you.

361
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:55,654
First, it is a matter of understanding one's own self

362
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:58,418
which has been said in all scriptures

363
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:03,998
that Atmasakhshatkar means to know oneself.

364
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:06,557
What does it mean to know oneself?

365
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:15,341
To know means to know who is in front of you and who is behind you.

366
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:18,772
Who is your protector?

367
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:24,492
And the love and affection you have for people

368
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:30,899
and those who always think how to please others

369
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:34,299
For example (NOT CLEAR)

370
00:37:34,324 --> 00:37:36,835
that i will make the whole world happy.

371
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,269
I will fill everyone's heart with joy.

372
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:41,447
This thought that comes in your mind

373
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:47,524
you should understand that there is nobody who can harm you.

374
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,006
Have courage!

375
00:37:50,446 --> 00:37:52,377
Nobody will destroy you.

376
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:55,064
And for that you don't have to do anything.

377
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:03,774
For that you don't need to keep any sword

378
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:06,358
no need to have a mace

379
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,674
They are already there.

380
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,783
They have already come, well prepared.

381
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:12,853
And they are settled in you.

382
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:21,404
 You don't need to make yourself strong. You are already so.

383
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:29,454
There is a Chinese story, very interesting!

384
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:33,788
In their country, cock fights are organized.

385
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,336
When the cock fight was on, it so happened that

386
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:46,311
somehow a king felt that he should go to a saint.

387
00:38:47,506 --> 00:38:54,545
Let the cocks learn from the saint, how to fight with the world.

388
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:57,162
Because, this saint does not fight with anyone

389
00:38:57,187 --> 00:38:58,752
 nor anyone touches him.

390
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,173
People run away from him

391
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:03,986
 and salute him.

392
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:07,943
So what is so special about him

393
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:14,095
that he is living in this wicked world like this.

394
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:18,940
The saint told him,''Ok! leave the cock here.''

395
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:23,321
So, he went back, leaving one cock with him.

396
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:26,325
 He took back that cock after one month

397
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,361
 and put him where the cock fight was going on.

398
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,489
There were a lot of cocks.

399
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:37,067
 He put him in such a courtyard.

400
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:43,997
But this great cock kept standing.

401
00:39:44,774 --> 00:39:48,561
Now all the cocks were fighting among themselves.

402
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,960
One after the other they left.

403
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,799
Only this one cock kept standing.

404
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:00,186
Everybody started getting scared of him
 and he is not reacting at all.

405
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,473
 Is he somewhat special?

406
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:09,076
And at the end that one cock was saved who kept standing gracefully.

407
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:14,213
So when we are doing the puja of Hanuman Ji here today

408
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:19,181
 we must think that Hanumanji has settled in reality within us.

409
00:40:20,975 --> 00:40:23,622
He is on our right side.

410
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:33,057
 That means He is working on our Pingala Nadi.

411
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:40,574
He works on our Pingala Nadi and creates enthusiasm in us

412
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:46,257
and that creates warmath in our body.

413
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:49,121
 But his path is such that

414
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:53,144
 along with warmath you feel devotion within you.

415
00:40:56,271 --> 00:40:59,327
So, the warmath that comes, the enthusiasm it creates

416
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:07,045
 that works inside us on our right side

417
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:12,986
 and when we do not absorb the balanced power of Hanumanji

418
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:17,056
 we get a lot of diseases.

419
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:33,493
For example the liver problem, asthma

420
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:37,763
 and when its heat goes downwards

421
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,670
 Hanumanji controls this heat.

422
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:46,079
But when the heat doesn't get controlled, such diseases attack

423
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:48,337
which are incurable.

424
00:41:48,362 --> 00:41:50,735
It can cause blood cancer

425
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,800
and there can be intestinal trouble

426
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:55,072
 which means all the troubles all over the world are

427
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,781
caused just by the breakdown of the liver

428
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:04,969
 and the liver gets spoiled because we do not follow Hanumanji.

429
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:09,059
There is no need to get angry.

430
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,783
 But getting angry and start hitting,

431
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:19,725
 beating this and that person to create panic,

432
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:22,829
this is not Hanumanji's power.

433
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,988
There is no question of getting angry.

434
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:34,679
 There is no question of getting angry about anyone.

435
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:40,561
There is no need at all, if you respect Hanumanji.

436
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:43,123
 He is not angry with anyone

437
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:49,791
But a human being gets angry over everything.

438
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,846
 He gets ego.

439
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:55,807
Hanumanji didn't have ego at all.

440
00:42:55,832 --> 00:42:59,079
 A right sided person is very egoistic.

441
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:03,946
A human being has so much ego!

442
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:07,899
 I become restless when I see what they were egotistical.

443
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:12,848
That ego doesn't have any meaning

444
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,164
 What does "I" mean?

445
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:21,985
Even an ordinary human being becomes egoistic.

446
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:25,538
 And many Kings and emperors also are not egoistic.

447
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:31,599
Its reason is that inside their being there is such a conditioning

448
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,295
 that they do not recognize Hanumanji.

449
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:40,835
As soon as you recognize Hanuman Ji, you recognise Shri Ram.

450
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:48,817
 Now tell Me if you are right sided, you should not get Asthma

451
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:50,678
 because Shree Ram is settled

452
00:43:50,703 --> 00:43:53,437
 according to Sahaja Yoga in our right heart.

453
00:43:55,573 --> 00:43:58,419
Because you do not recognize Hanumanji

454
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:03,419
 your behaviour and your balance is not like His

455
00:44:03,444 --> 00:44:06,808
 that is why you get Asthma as well.

456
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:16,947
Shivji's place is in your heart,  there also is the same fuss

457
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:22,443
 and you can get a heart attack or you can have some other diseases.

458
00:44:24,818 --> 00:44:29,466
After coming to Sahaja Yoga you should understand that

459
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:32,896
 Hanumanji is an ideal in front of you.

460
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:38,986
Ganeshji is already there, He is the incarnation of innocence

461
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,006
 just like small children, very innocent

462
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:47,035
but very wise.

463
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:51,719
And a perfect balance of Hanumanji’s

464
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:54,980
happiness full of love

465
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,844
and along with that experience Divine power.

466
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,823
Keeping this in mind

467
00:45:03,848 --> 00:45:06,830
 a Sahaja Yogi's character or life should be such

468
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:10,163
that he should be balanced.

469
00:45:10,188 --> 00:45:16,857
Even when you are angry, just observe silence.

470
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:22,510
I feel, I never get angry.

471
00:45:22,535 --> 00:45:26,767
Or maybe I get angry, but I am not aware of it.

472
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:31,949
And the problem gets solved without getting angry.

473
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:34,986
Yes, I may say,"what are you doing?"

474
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:38,244
Not much beyond this.

475
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:43,408
People abuse and use all bad words

476
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,855
 But when it crosses its limits

477
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:51,729
and when this habit of getting angry crosses its limits and man.....

478
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:53,985
He is sitting angrily

479
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,631
sitting there in a very angry mood.

480
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,532
He is showing his anger.

481
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:03,029
 When people are like that, a serious problem arises

482
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:08,480
 they get a serious disease called Alzheimer.

483
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:12,380
Alzheimer is caused by anger.

484
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:19,357
 That anger which we get unnecessarily.

485
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:23,527
Now try to understand, Your son has been slapped by somebody.

486
00:46:23,552 --> 00:46:25,664
 And you get angry.

487
00:46:26,837 --> 00:46:29,353
Nothing is gained by getting angry.

488
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:33,144
On the contrary you should think, if it is the mistake of our son?

489
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:37,642
 Or we are spoiling that boy unnecessarily
under the cover of our love.

490
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:45,176
He will never have a balance in this way.

491
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:48,664
 Alzheimer is a very serious disease.

492
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,809
A person gets mad,

493
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:54,165
 doesn't even die, nor allows anyone to die,

494
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,791
abuses, goes on shouting.

495
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:04,144
 He gets so much caught up in his left side, in his brain

496
00:47:04,193 --> 00:47:07,263
 that his personality becomes very strange.

497
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:12,565
It's treatment is in Sahaja Yoga

498
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,190
 but it is very difficult,

499
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:16,623
because they go on abusing.

500
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:19,637
 If they will abuse the person who will go to set them right,

501
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:22,606
who will accept it. If anyone is a doctor.

502
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,089
if he is abused, he will say let him go to hell.

503
00:47:25,114 --> 00:47:26,990
 What have I to do with him?

504
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,046
This is what happens with them, they don't want to.

505
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:33,292
 Mother we won't set them right, let them go.

506
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:36,786
Whichever way they want to live, let them live.

507
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:43,913
 Now the next greatest enemies of Hanumanji are drunkards.

508
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:51,315
Those who drink, are put to flames like Lanka.

509
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:57,724
Say, you see those who drink

510
00:47:57,912 --> 00:48:00,625
nobody will talk to them nor do anything else.

511
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,789
He will collect ten more drunkards and drink.

512
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:06,982
And now when all of them are drinking

513
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:11,184
 they don't have anything to eat nor to drink at their homes.

514
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:15,738
They are drinking just like mad people.

515
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:20,937
 Those who respect Hanumanji, can't drink,

516
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:22,561
can't drink because,

517
00:48:24,337 --> 00:48:26,275
 on the one hand, you respect Him

518
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,197
 and on the other hand do the opposite, that is not possible.

519
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:33,225
Nowadays I find that drinking is on the rise.

520
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,799
 And I am so surprised , there was a senior officer

521
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,233
 once we went to his house,

522
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:50,942
because both of them were friends of My Husband.

523
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:53,592
 And both husband and wife would drink.

524
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,171
It was very cold.

525
00:48:56,196 --> 00:48:58,358
 They told Me,"Stay here for the night."

526
00:48:58,383 --> 00:49:00,284
I said,"Ok, we will stay."

527
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:02,440
 In the whole house, there was just one blanket.

528
00:49:02,465 --> 00:49:04,077
I said,"Oh! My God!"

529
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,110
Just one blanket in the home of such a senior officer.

530
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:09,270
I said," It doesn't matter to Me, I will sleep."

531
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:12,739
Now they were worried, how to manage for My husband in one blanket.

532
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:16,699
I said," Don't worry. I will set it right."

533
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:20,408
They had such a great problem about themselves and their daughter

534
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:21,951
but they were not willing to agree

535
00:49:21,976 --> 00:49:24,648
that their daughter had any problem.

536
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,408
As soon as they drink

537
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:27,944
they will start saying

538
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:30,976
 our daughter is best of all, don't say anything.

539
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:33,630
That girl was in complete devastation,

540
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:35,337
 because they were under the influence of intoxication.

541
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:37,426
When intoxicated they were not are not in senses.

542
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:42,795
That girl was completely devastated.

543
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,463
 At last she came to Me just now, crying.

544
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:48,258
She has been totally devastated.

545
00:49:49,613 --> 00:49:53,135
So it is like this that intoxication on account of drinking

546
00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:57,267
 increases intoxication all the more

547
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,638
 and in that the most intoxicating thing is that

548
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,953
 a man is devoid of love.

549
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:06,947
He doesn't love anyone.

550
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:13,110
 That is why everyone, in every religion, prohibited drinking.

551
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,964
But for example, as is the case with the Christian religion

552
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,917
everybody manages somehow.

553
00:50:19,942 --> 00:50:20,880
They say it is so in Hindu dharam,

554
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:23,606
 in Christians and in Mohammedans too.

555
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:26,553
So they said that when

556
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:31,696
 Christ had gone to attend a marriage,

557
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:34,372
in that marriage liquor was made.

558
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,586
 Absolutely false!

559
00:50:38,003 --> 00:50:39,748
That is why we drink.

560
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:43,771
 I was surprised in England that if anyone dies, they drink

561
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:46,091
 if anyone dies, even then they drink.

562
00:50:46,116 --> 00:50:48,458
If anyone is born, even then they drink.

563
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,855
 What does it mean, I can't understand.

564
00:50:51,947 --> 00:50:54,215
The habit that they have got used to

565
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,101
 and drink has become like culture.

566
00:50:58,126 --> 00:50:59,924
They have to write books about drinks

567
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:02,366
 which should be drunk when

568
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:03,432
 not this,that

569
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:06,665
 and  which type of glass should be used.

570
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,384
Now the condition of these drunkards that I have seen

571
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:16,851
 I think they are half human beings and half absolutely mad.

572
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:19,188
They are mad!

573
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:22,211
 But it is getting sanctified there.

574
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:24,285
It is topmost in France.

575
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,151
It became the culture of France.

576
00:51:26,176 --> 00:51:28,998
We don't have to learn anything from them.

577
00:51:29,023 --> 00:51:31,777
 Now what they talk about drinks;

578
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:37,664
Christ, when He went there that time,  that place

579
00:51:37,689 --> 00:51:40,166
 I have read this in HEBRU

580
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,256
 that the people

581
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:47,210
 used to drink the juice of DRAKSHA

582
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,198
 means, they used to take grape juice.

583
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:56,945
So He put His hand in water and made juice of grapes out of water.

584
00:51:57,089 --> 00:52:01,489
 Does that juice ever become a drink without rotting and softening?

585
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:06,742
Can a drink ever be made in two minutes in Sahaj?

586
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:09,095
 Till you do not rot the drink a lot

587
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,849
 and the more it is rotten, the more it is costlier.

588
00:52:13,373 --> 00:52:16,866
If it has been rotten for the past fifty years
 it is all the more better.

589
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:20,909
And if it is a hundred year old, it is rare.

590
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:24,571
 These notions about drinks were created by drunkards,

591
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:27,473
the drunkard writers and the drunkard tellers.

592
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:31,515
 With the lectures of the drunkards

593
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,522
 don't know how many people become fools.

594
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:39,698
But I have not seen any effigy erected of
any drunkard in any country.

595
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:49,506
 So all these people

596
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:55,292
 are not only against Shri Hanuman,

597
00:52:55,364 --> 00:52:58,511
but they attack Him.

598
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:00,689
 Then He also shows His power,

599
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,684
causing such heat in his stomach.

600
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:07,907
 It then causes Cancer and all the diseases.

601
00:53:07,932 --> 00:53:09,529
Drink more and more!

602
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:19,118
 This drinking and serving drinks to others

603
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:22,628
 is the custom of drinking that has started.

604
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:25,416
I am scared of this.

605
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:27,309
Manage Hanumanji

606
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,317
Don't know what He will do.

607
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:32,588
What disaster He may cause

608
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,848
is unpredictable.

609
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:40,521
I am afraid that one day He may put all the drunkards in the sea,

610
00:53:41,504 --> 00:53:47,006
 because  He has mercy, devotion and everything

611
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:49,746
 but those who are against Him

612
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,543
 he is not for them.

613
00:53:51,822 --> 00:53:53,948
For example Shri Ganesha

614
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:57,897
 if anyone has a bad character

615
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,312
 if any one acts badly

616
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,950
is attacked on his Mooladhara Chakra.

617
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:10,314
 But His case is different.

618
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:17,095
When He sees that he is playing with his own consciousness

619
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:25,706
 by drinking- consciousness is lost- then He chases him.

620
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:30,633
There will be conflict, quarrels and fights in homes

621
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:33,487
 and you see there will be fights on roads if you..

622
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,260
NOT CLEAR..

623
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:39,248
 two drunkards will be hitting each other

624
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:43,814
 and then it spreads all the more.

625
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,291
So Sahaja Yogis should not visit any drunkard's house

626
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,143
 that is an unholy place

627
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:58,206
 nor should keep any association with any drunkard.

628
00:55:00,393 --> 00:55:02,802
This is also fatal for Sahaja Yogis

629
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,397
 because on one hand you respect Hanumanji

630
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:07,624
 and on the other hand join drunkards.

631
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:26,863
Especially in Poona, I don't know
how many types of Hanumanjis have come  here,

632
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:32,042
people living in Poona should be very alert.

633
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:39,612
Once a Hanumanji group had come
and requested Me to deliver a lecture.

634
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:40,914
 I said ,"I won't come".

635
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:42,326
They asked, “Why Mother?"

636
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:47,598
 I told them that after having a drink you sing silly movie songs.

637
00:55:47,623 --> 00:55:51,405
Do you know who is this Maruti?

638
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,631
 When He will strangle throats of all of you

639
00:55:53,656 --> 00:55:55,523
 then only you will come to know.

640
00:55:55,548 --> 00:56:02,430
I have heard about Ganpati programs
 that  they don't allow anyone to drink.

641
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:05,216
 They drive away those who drink.

642
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:06,767
Just think,

643
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:09,146
 see their courage!

644
00:56:09,171 --> 00:56:13,149
In front of Hanumanji, they do all this business

645
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:16,566
 In front of Hanumanji!

646
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:20,053
What a courage!

647
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,550
and this

648
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:25,788
by doing everything

649
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:29,745
people think that they get money.

650
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:33,726
Those who deal in it

651
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:38,365
and those who drink, are its customers

652
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:43,867
everybody somehow absolutely

653
00:56:45,456 --> 00:56:51,194
useless, bankrupt , don't have a single penny

654
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,484
We will say, what is there so much in drinking

655
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:02,219
 because it is Shri Hanumanji's case.

656
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:06,869
What is the reason you are going against Hanumanji?

657
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:11,177
His power flows through your right side.

658
00:57:11,202 --> 00:57:14,449
Use that in balance.

659
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:18,859
 instead of upsetting your liver, spoil this and spoil that.

660
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,413
He will definitely get upset.

661
00:57:21,015 --> 00:57:24,259
 That means it is Hanumanji's job in subtle.

662
00:57:25,878 --> 00:57:29,478
People don't understand this in reality.

663
00:57:29,676 --> 00:57:31,655
 In reality it is such

664
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,774
that if you say something against drinking

665
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:36,749
 people will run to kill you.

666
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:38,470
If you don't drink

667
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:41,091
they will say you are a fool that you don't drink.

668
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:53,072
Oh!  behind him is standing such great Hanumanji.

669
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,053
If you attack him even once

670
00:57:56,078 --> 00:57:58,360
 you will be no more,  you will lose your life.

671
00:57:58,385 --> 00:58:00,560
 I think that if people start striking beforehand.....

672
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:03,272
How do people talk such nonsense?

673
00:58:06,635 --> 00:58:09,318
They will repeat the same thing again and again.

674
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:13,347
They are almost absolutely mad

675
00:58:13,372 --> 00:58:18,570
they are all together, have a party and they are all mad.

676
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:27,134
It may be marriage or marriage procession,
 everywhere it is prevalent.

677
00:58:28,815 --> 00:58:35,976
Now the person who works

678
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:40,695
one who thinks of the future, one who is thoughtful

679
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,412
 but is devoid of love towards everyone

680
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,150
 has no feeling of love, he is also in trouble.

681
00:58:48,762 --> 00:58:54,672
Because  the devotee of Rama

682
00:58:55,337 --> 00:58:59,875
 there is no whereabouts of Hanumanji.

683
00:59:03,598 --> 00:59:08,616
If you are a great worker

684
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:10,849
you are a well to do person, a nice person

685
00:59:10,886 --> 00:59:13,724
but you don't have love for anyone

686
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:18,151
it won't work.

687
00:59:19,277 --> 00:59:22,910
You have to love everyone

688
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:25,526
and that is why

689
00:59:25,681 --> 00:59:30,556
 Christ has said ,"Forgive everyone."

690
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:34,910
Who are you not to forgive?

691
00:59:35,495 --> 00:59:37,765
 You yourself are not Hanumanji.

692
00:59:38,026 --> 00:59:42,597
Yes, Hanumanji is with you and He is an ideal for you

693
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:51,588
 that He on the basis of His devotion
 has attained this high position.

694
00:59:53,691 --> 00:59:58,620
Wherever there is heat, people's brains get upset

695
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,848
 and the bond of love gets disrupted.

696
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,086
Every body should salute such Hanuman devotee, Shri Bajrangbali

697
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:20,827
 and should understand that whatever powers
 we have got from Sahaja Yoga

698
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:23,554
 we should keep in balance.

699
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:29,176
Love is such a thing

700
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:36,844
 that you can win over great personalities with the bond of love.

701
01:00:39,915 --> 01:00:42,652
I go on doing the same

702
01:00:42,677 --> 01:00:45,839
 because I have to face strange people.

703
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:51,882
Now handle them with such a trick of love that they will be ok.

704
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:54,843
Once I went somewhere.

705
01:00:54,882 --> 01:00:59,098
There was a famous but very short tempered saint;

706
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,124
All of them are very short tempered.

707
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:04,198
Then I climbed up and went there.

708
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:09,432
He was shaking his neck in anger.

709
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:17,650
Because he was egoistic that he could control rain.

710
01:01:18,149 --> 01:01:22,054
And as I climbed up and reached

711
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,016
I was drenched completely wet in rain.

712
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:29,447
Now, he was sitting in great anger.

713
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,295
I sat in his cave.

714
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,284
He came and sat

715
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:36,281
He was very angry.

716
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:39,730
I asked,"What happened, even if I got wet?"

717
01:01:39,755 --> 01:01:48,532
 He said, "You did not stop the rain to take away my ego.

718
01:01:48,557 --> 01:01:50,403
Because I can stop it.

719
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:52,489
I had this ego."

720
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:54,435
"There is nothing like that."

721
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:59,737
I said,"You are a Saint and you have purchased a saree for Me.

722
01:02:00,204 --> 01:02:06,415
I cannot take anything from a saint.

723
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:09,483
And you cannot give Me anything.

724
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,056
Then I thought it is better to get wet
nd I will have to accept it."

725
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:17,509
Because of that

726
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:21,988
tears came out of his eyes and he fell down at My feet.

727
01:02:22,726 --> 01:02:26,145
I said, ‘what should I have done?
 I had to just get wet.

728
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:29,453
Otherwise I too would not have accepted it.

729
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:31,367
 I said that it is better to get a little wet

730
01:02:31,392 --> 01:02:33,003
 then I will have to accept it’.

731
01:02:34,323 --> 01:02:36,563
Then he said, "Is it so?"

732
01:02:36,588 --> 01:02:41,172
I said you have purchased a peach coloured saree for Me

733
01:02:41,197 --> 01:02:43,984
and nauvar (nine yards) this you have done a good thing

734
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:49,089
because My petticoat too has got wet, so I can wear this nauvar.

735
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:52,465
He was very happy.

736
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,868
So, love is such a thing

737
01:02:56,043 --> 01:03:00,891
 that it brings down to earth even great people fuming with anger.

738
01:03:02,497 --> 01:03:07,923
There are so many earlier examples of it.

739
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:12,971
When they say," Basu"(Sit down),
the whole night will pass like that.

740
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,489
And even now everyday it happens so.

741
01:03:16,514 --> 01:03:18,821
Talk with love.

742
01:03:19,717 --> 01:03:21,562
How does it matter?

743
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:26,874
If you love others, their good qualities will transmit to you

744
01:03:27,163 --> 01:03:36,722
 and if you hate someone, their bad qualities will transmit to you.

745
01:03:37,262 --> 01:03:39,725
It is all give and take.

746
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:43,684
 This person is like this, that person is like that

747
01:03:43,709 --> 01:03:45,798
whosoever you see is not right.

748
01:03:47,399 --> 01:03:49,996
It is a custom with so many people

749
01:03:50,021 --> 01:03:51,492
It is their culture

750
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,824
that if someone comes to his home

751
01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:55,819
stays, has his meals and fun and everything is over.

752
01:03:55,844 --> 01:03:59,764
As soon as he leaves, comments follow that he is such a bad man.

753
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,291
Next came and sat down

754
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,894
especially among women it is too much prevalent.

755
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,420
He comes and sits.

756
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:07,569
You are very nice, very nice and now you can go.

757
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,408
Yes he is like that!

758
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:14,723
Oh! this outward love won't work.

759
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:20,780
If you shower artificial love, does he not understand?

760
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:27,204
 You have got the power to love by heart as you are a Sahaja Yogi.

761
01:04:30,026 --> 01:04:35,641
And when you will imbibe this

762
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:42,098
when the tree of love will bloom by itself

763
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:47,695
you will give joy to others and you too will enjoy its fragrance.

764
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:53,244
Except the ocean of love, you will not like anything.

765
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,891
So, what you have to learn from Bajrangbali is

766
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:06,338
His devotion and that power which He has given to you

767
01:05:06,363 --> 01:05:11,425
that nobody can touch you if your devotion is pure.

768
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:13,866
Nobody can touch you.

769
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:16,963
 There are thousands of such examples in Sahaja Yoga.

770
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:19,028
People call these miracles

771
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:23,540
 but I say that it is Shri Hanumanji's blessing.

772
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:33,686
So, now I give My blessings and love to all of you.

773
01:05:35,509 --> 01:05:39,785
 First love yourself and then others.

774
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,009
It doesn't mean my son, my this

775
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:42,766
No! No! No!

776
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:48,643
It means selfless love.

777
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:51,185
 Love that expects no return,

778
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:55,982
Which has no relation, is limitless.

779
01:05:56,007 --> 01:06:02,624
 Such a power of love has come to you, use it.

780
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:06,156
Lots of blessings!

781
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:31,554
Anant Aashirvad (Limitless blessings).
