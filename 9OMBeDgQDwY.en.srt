1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,480
Now, then you have to go further.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,570
See you find yourself that your right side 
is hot.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,690
What you do is put your right side towards 
the photograph

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,219
and the left side up towards the ether.

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,529
The ether takes away the heat.

6
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,630
But what actually happens is that

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,949
your right side gets the vibration and

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,699
the heat is pushed towards your left and passes 
out into the ether.

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,270
Now this heat comes from too much futuristic 
living.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,230
Those people who are too much futuristic, 
they have too much heat.

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,750
And too much heat has to go away,

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,730
and when this heat starts going away then 
you are amazed how it works.

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,760
For that there are various things we have 
to use,

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,640
but mainly for right-sided people they should 
not use any light at all.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,900
They should not sit in the sun.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,580
They should sit in the moonlight.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,040
They should read some poetry.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,820
They should not tie up watches.

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,320
They should not look at time.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,530
They should allow the time to pass,

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,390
and they should just become very, sort of 
emotional people.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,890
They should sing songs of bhakti.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,100
They should not do Hatha Yoga.

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,090
There are so many things they should not do 
if they are right sided.

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,710
You will be surprised how people have been 
helped through this kind of a treatment,

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,960
which treats one side of your being.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:40,790
On the left hand side people are the people 
as you know are the ones who are docile,

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,880
who bear up lots of things from others

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:51,560
and cry and weep and all the time are on the 
losers end.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,840
Such people have problems also because all 
their organs are lethargic

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,880
and they have problems of a lethargic heart,

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,860
lethargic liver, lethargic intestines.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,100
Everything becomes very lethargic.

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,450
All these left side things can be cured.

35
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,219
Plus they might have some sort of a badha 
in them,

36
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,859
in the sense they are possessed by someone.

37
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:19,079
Of course, some of them are possessed by right 
side also.

38
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,980
Not that only the left side is possessed.

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,239
But from the right side also they are possessed.

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,170
And left sided possessions are of a peculiar 
type,

41
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,069
because they give you pain in the body.

42
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,230
You get pains in the body.

43
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,659
Right sided person doesn’t get any pain 
himself.

44
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,319
He gives pain to others.

45
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,439
He is very sarcastic, he is very aggressive, 
he troubles others,

46
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,720
but the left sided people have pains themselves.

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,900
They get a pain here and a pain there and 
pain here.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,370
So left side has to be cleared, as you know 
very well through the light.

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,419
Light is put before the photograph,

50
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:57,870
left hand towards the photograph, right hand 
on the Mother Earth.

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,659
So the left hand gets the light

52
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,590
and the light passes through and the negativity 
of the left side passes to the right hand,

53
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,919
and the right hand is on the Mother Earth.

54
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:15,269
The Mother Earth is the one who sucks in all 
these negative forces of the left hand side.

55
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,579
So these are the two sides which we clear.

56
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,080
But once you have cleared these two sides 
then you can use the photograph.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,859
Sit with your both the hands towards the photograph 
and put both the feet in the water,

58
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,269
little bit of salt in it and about five ten 
minutes

59
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,449
you must allow the vibrations to clear you 
out.

60
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,180
Then wipe your feet.

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,579
Put the water properly into some disposal 
and then sit down for meditation.

62
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:48,639
If you can do that everyday, even ten minutes, 
is more than sufficient.

63
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,949
Don’t have to do anything in an extreme 
manner.

64
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:54,010
In the morning time,

65
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,970
you have to give yourself a bandhan when you 
are going out.

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,059
Don’t go out without giving a bandhan.

67
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:05,239
And attention should be all the time inside, 
in the sense that,

68
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,589
walking on the road people have habit of seeing 
this, seeing that, seeing like that.

69
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,790
The attention gets frittered away.

70
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,790
What you should see is

71
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,190
you should see about three feet or four feet 
at the most from the ground and not above.

72
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,590
Because you can see all the beautiful children, 
flowers everything.

73
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,379
There is nothing very beautiful above that.

74
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:29,720
So better is to see only up three four feet 
if possible, to fix your attention,

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,030
so the attention becomes concentrated.

76
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,870
And you feel very relaxed and relieved of 
too much of wobbling of your eyes.

77
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,970
Eyes are very important.

78
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,199
Very important, and as you will notice, because 
you are all realized souls,

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,460
that your eyes now have got a glint, a kind 
of a light in the eye.

80
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,590
And that light shows that you are realized 
souls.

81
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:03,050
But to keep it up you have to look at things 
which are not anti God,

82
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,820
which are not dirty, which are not filthy, 
which are against Sahaj religion,

83
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
which is against Sahaj culture.

84
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,120
If you can manage that, it is going to help 
you a lot.
