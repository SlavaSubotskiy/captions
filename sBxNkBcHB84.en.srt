1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,040
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,720
We cannot organize it, we cannot change it,

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,020
we cannot order it, we live to accept it

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,200
as it is. The Truth is that

5
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,740
this whole universe is guided,

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,740
organized by a very subtle power

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,440
that [UNCLEAR] had to plan it that Param Chaitanya

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,700
or as they call it as Ruh in Koran

9
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,480
or as [UNCLEAR - COOL BREEZE?] in the Bible.

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,900
In those days of Science, for a modern man is too much to accept

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,140
that there could be something

12
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,960
like a subtle energy which organizes

13
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Logically we can accept up to a point

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,460
to understand so many things which have no answer in Science

15
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,740
but beyond thought, beyond the intellect

16
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,400
if we can reach into another great truth about ourselves

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,760
- that is, if you become the Spirit, if you get your Atmasakshatkar,

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,260
then, you can feel

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,800
that subtle energy on your finger-tips, on your hands.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:34,180
Also, as a result of this power, the residual power of the Kundalini,

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,240
which is like this cord,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,040
which rises, pierces through six centers, passes through your fontanel bone area

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,820
you can also feel the cool breeze coming out of your own head.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,020
This is the ultimate goal of our human life.

25
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,100
You know the Absolute Truth not relative. What we know, is the relative truth.

26
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,320
Unless and until this happening takes place within us,

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,120
whatever we know is so relative that

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,660
one person may not agree with another person.

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,860
In one family there may be disagreement but once you reach to this state of Self-realization,

30
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,340
there is no difference at all in understanding it that [UNCLEAR]

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,960
It is a very ancient science of our country. In the West,

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,680
I would say,  the civilization grew like a tree

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,540
but the roots are here in the Orient and these roots are

34
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,380
like a knowledge of nourishment for [UNCLEAR]

35
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:24,540
If you allow the [UNCLEAR] to grow without finding out it's roots and the nourishment for it,

36
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:33,060
it's definite, that such a tree will have to get completely destroyed.

37
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,220
To understand that

38
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,440
what I'm saying is the truth, you have to have little scientific attitude towards it.

39
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:59,500
A scientist has to have an open mind to see for himself, that whatever I'm saying,

40
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,420
if it is true, then one has to accept it.

41
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,900
First this is like a hypothesis and if this hypothesis can be proved

42
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,080
then, as honest people you have to accept because this is

43
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,940
for the benevolence of every individual, of every society, of every country

44
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,780
and the whole of the human emancipation

45
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,700
because when this happening takes place, the

46
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,220
transformation of the personality - complete transformation.

47
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,560
It's very amazing because so fantastic that people cannot believe it that

48
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,440
one can be transformed but what is it?

49
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,800
Like a, if you take a [UNCLEAR] clean

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,840
[UNCLEAR] that it's just a box

51
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,740
but if you put that connected to the mains,

52
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,520
then you find, it's fantastic.

53
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,140
In the same way, a human-being is a tremendous

54
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,760
powerful personality within himself and the power is that of love

55
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,460
and compassion. You have never used the power of love - you have only used the power of hatred, so far.

56
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,440
Once the person gets transformed, he becomes dynamic, very dynamic,

57
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,540
relaxed, becomes like a witness of the whole play

58
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,440
and all that is described about saints, you can see all that working out within you.

59
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,020
And this man analyzes

60
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,660
and by not understanding it through mental capacity,

61
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,400
inhibit [UNCLEAR] up the idea

62
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,040
of God Almighty and His powers - that's not true.

63
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,180
Just for a short time at least the [UNCLEAR - GLANCE?] have come but whatever is done, has to accept it

64
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,780
and unless and until you find internal [UNCLEAR]

65
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,720
we are not going to be satisfied, we are not going to be happy.

66
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I don't know what Mr. Murthy has told you about but the first thing that happens

67
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,800
when this kundalini rises, is that you get [UNCLEAR]

68
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,380
your sicknesses are cured because all the sickness,

69
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,700
mental or physical, comes from the disturbances in the chakra

70
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,820
in the centers, in the subtle centers which are partly in our spinal cord

71
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,960
and partly in our brain.

72
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:50,400
If these centers can be put right and could be nourished by the awakening of the Kundalini,

73
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,140
then, you feel the well-being

74
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,340
of your health, also your mental capacity.

75
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,400
I can tell you many things that can happen.

76
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,180
We have known many children who were supposed to be very dull in their classes,

77
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,380
they stood first class first, they got schloarships, they're doing very well.

78
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,840
On the mental side there have been many people who suffered from mental extremes and diseases of [UNCLEAR] also manifest in the being

79
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,180
schizophrenia - they have been cured. There's a doctor in

80
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,860
Delhi, who has got now his MD, where he has shown that epilepsy can be cured through sahaja yog.

81
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,560
There are three doctors who have got MD

82
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,380
and surprisingly when we went to Russia, they saw all our papers and amazingly,

83
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,560
immediately they accepted sahaja yoga as an independent organization.

84
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,120
This is the only organization which is independent in Russia

85
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,820
and they say, they had no conditioning of any kind.

86
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,480
In our country we have conditionings of man made religions.

87
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,900
Most of these religions have nothing to do with the people who created [UNCLEAR],

88
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,500
they have nothing to do with the Incarnations, nothing to do with the prophets

89
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,640
and nothing to do with the saints. On the contrary all the saints, Incarnations

90
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,700
have [UNCLEAR] tortured by the same people who say that they are in charge of the religion.

91
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,060
I have seen in the West, that the religions are naturally

92
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,040
we came to atheism, we start telling the [UNCLEAR]

93
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,040
there's no God. The religion is within ourselves. The religion is our valency.

94
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,800
Like in the matter there are [UNCLEAR] up to eight valencies. In the human-beings there are ten valencies

95
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,440
and once these ten valencies get disturbed, you fall into trouble

96
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,000
and you start deteriorating in your health and also in  moral values.

97
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,960
So, to re-establish yourself, you have to have this last job of breakthrough in your evolution

98
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,680
from human awareness to this of, what we call as, the collective consciousness

99
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,300
which is just felt on your finger-tips. In the evolution [UNCLEAR] all about.

100
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,920
In any case, I'll be very happy if you can ask Me some questions today, so I could know what are the problems

101
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,580
that are affecting your mind, for sometime and then we'll have the Self-realization

102
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,820
after that. First thing, you should not be diffident; Everybody is capable of having Self-realization.

103
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Everyone can get Self-realization, so nobody should feel anyway diffident about it.

104
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,580
If you want, you can ask Me some questions now. I want to give some time for that.

105
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,800
If you people can come forward, it would be better because it is such a big hall. You just please - if you can come forward, would be better.

106
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,260
[ASIDE - Chashma de do, chashma]

107
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,560
Shri Mataji, I would like to know how to awaken the Kundalini?

108
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,480
That's very simple. That I will do, that I will manage - it's spontaneous.

109
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:09,480
It's like sprouting of the seed which is a living process - it's a living process.

110
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,860
Through a living process we have become human-beings from amoeba stage

111
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,760
and to go higher is also a living process. It just acts spontaneously.

112
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,320
First, I'll awaken your Kundalini - just not much to be done and then you can awaken the Kundalini of others.

113
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,580
It's very simple. Very good question.

114
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,200
Mataji, the Veda is the result of the deep meditation of our ancient sages

115
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,560
in the Ritambhara Pragya and Your sahaja yog samadhi also deals with this

116
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,800
and what is Your experience parallel to Veda of these vibes?

117
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:55,260
You see, Vedas were, I would say, there were three movements in our country in those days.

118
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,580
One was on the side of Vedas where - the first, first time that they said it that,

119
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,640
"If by reading and doing all these Vedas, if you do not get your Self-realization, it is of no use."

120
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:18,400
Then the same wave find, in those days there were three systems - one was, people were trying to

121
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,200
exploit or to find out the way to use the matter

122
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,260
and that's how the Vedas started to awaken the Vedas through spiritual powers

123
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,800
and that is what is the Vedas it is. And the another side is,

124
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,380
and that's the outcome of is is [UNCLEAR].

125
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:49,080
The another side is the one where we have bhakti. People used to do bhakti and

126
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,880
devotion. They used to go emotionally about finding God.

127
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,500
This, the central path was for, actually, redemption and for awakening the Kundalini

128
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:10,020
which was done by mostly the Nathpanthis like Machindernath, Gorakhnath, Adinath - these people did it.

129
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,720
Moreover, also you must have heard that

130
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,500
Janaka, the father of Sita, gave realization to one Nachiketa - only one person.

131
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:30,240
So, at that time there were very few flowers on the tree of life and that's why very few people got realization.

132
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:37,480
First of all, their basic cleansing [UNCLEAR] through the Vedas - cleansing it and awakening it.

133
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,520
The another side was, they tried to build their emotional side to receive the blessings

134
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,900
but the awakening of the Kundalini was done in very few people

135
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:59,740
and very few people, few people got realization in those days. Now the time has come that,

136
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,020
I feel, there's a blossom time and many people can get Self-realization.

137
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,660
So, the difference between the sahaja yoga that was followed long time back and today is this,

138
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,300
that in those days they had to cleanse like [UNCLEAR] from the body and out of that they used to get one person

139
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,980
and they would say that to be born again and again, come back again and again - cleansing was done periodically in different

140
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,020
lives and that's how then they got realization one person here and there.

141
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,840
But in sahaja yoga there are two things which we have been able to manage.

142
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:47,240
First thing, you can give en-masse realization. [UNCLEAR] Kundalini can be awakened

143
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,900
and it can pierce through your fontanel bone area

144
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,940
but in that little light you start seeing yourself.

145
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,620
As I said that, if there's a snake in your hand,

146
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,340
you're standing in the dark and somebody tells you, "There's a snake in your hand," you may say that, "It's not, it's a rope,"

147
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,600
but if there's a little light, you can see that, you will just drop it. So, the cleansing is done by you only

148
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,980
nobody else can do the cleansing - first. The second thing is that

149
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,360
you yourself get all the powers of awakening the Kundalini, you get all the knowledge about Kundalini,

150
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,120
so you can spread it fast. We can say that as it is a jet age

151
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,900
we also have to have a jet Kundalini and it has to work that way. So it has grown up to that.

152
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:45,240
My contribution to this is only, is this that I wanted to find out a en-masse way of giving realization to people

153
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,480
because one person is Atmasakshatkari, one person can say, "It's gossip."

154
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,840
Moreover, any discovery, say the discovery of electricity, if it was meant for one or two persons, it was

155
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,460
never accepted nor of any value. So the time has come for this en-masse evolution

156
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:12,640
and this is working out through this modern sahaja yog. There's no way we are discarding Vedas or the bhakti part of it

157
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,180
but the essence of it, the core of it was to receive Atmasakshatkara, which is achieved through sahaja yoga.

158
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,580
So we can say, this is the culmination of all these things in modern times.

159
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,840
Shri Mataji, how one could realize that Kundalini has been awakened?

160
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:39,780
That is what I was doing. That point you leave. I'm very happy to hear that; That's a real sadhaka - I see the question. May God bless you!

161
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,700
[UNCLEAR QUESTION FROM AUDIENCE]

162
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,560
[UNCLEAR] It wasn't very clear. Now some school of thought

163
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:01,680
believe that the Kundalini can be raised from the Sushumna through the spinal cord at the back of the body.

164
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,080
Now what we see in this picture, we raise from the Mooladhara up to the Sahastrara, in the front portion

165
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,000
so what is the difference of our Kundalini enunciation and here that...

166
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,960
[UNCLEAR]

167
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,540
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

168
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,660
No, no it is on the back. It is in the chart how to show the back so [UNCLEAR]

169
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,660
it is not - it is on the front. Of course, the Sushumna Nadi is the Brahmanadi.

170
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,180
The Sushumna has also got inside, a very sukshma nadi, called Brahmanadi. Through that only few,

171
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,560
few threads of Kundalini rises first and then it starts opening the chakra and then more threads come up

172
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,700
So, it is not in the front - it is correct.

173
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,780
- Veda gives us three aspects as You said - that is karma, bhakti and gyana. Gyana is the [UNCLEAR]
- Alright

174
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
and it has been accepted. So, but to acquire gyana no karma or no action is necessary?

175
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,580
- No
- Here this is also a mental action or how do You [UNCLEAR] this?

176
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,080
No, no, no there is nothing to be done. Who told you? Please sit down. Don't be aggressive - just try to understand.

177
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,700
Gyana is something that you feel on your Central Nervous System [UNCLEAR]

178
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,100
is Bodha - alright? Now, you don't have to do anything [UNCLEAR - IS THAT CLEAR?]

179
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,520
It is spontaneous, it's a living process.

180
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,200
You don't have to do anything. If you have to do anything, then it is not. Don't have to do anything.

181
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:52,240
Only thing, once you get your realization, you have to know where are your centers, what is your problem, how to correct them.

182
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:59,380
That is to settle because first you give a connection - suppose - and if it is loose, then you should know how to make it proper

183
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,560
because, as it is you know, human-beings have problems

184
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,200
and the Kundalini knows, because She is your individual mother. Every person has his own Kundalini

185
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,120
and every Kundalini has recorded what that person carries and that Kundalini

186
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,260
knows each and every thing about you, so when She rises - She rises although but then again She settles back

187
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,440
into the places where you have problems, so you must know how to fix it up - that's all.

188
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,740
Who, what made you think that you have to do something? Don't have to do. You can't even pay for it, you can't do anything.

189
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,280
It may work it may not work. There's no guarantee.

190
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,720
It may work, it may not work. In some people it does not work. In some people it works immediately.

191
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,020
So it has to do also [UNCLEAR] also [UNCLEAR] on

192
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,660
inner being. Suppose, you have some sickness

193
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,980
you have some mental problems, you have some terrible conditions, then it may not rise but we have to give it a chance.

194
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,820
Like, if there's a bad seed, it may not sprout. Then, there may be a seed which is not properly planted

195
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,180
something like that may happen but most of the people do get realization.

196
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
Any bad [UNCLEAR] is a good being [UNCLEAR]

197
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,540
[UNCLEAR]

198
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,800
That is not just now the problem is. You see, whatever you have written or whatever you have done, is alright.

199
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,800
Whatever you have done in the past, you have to forget. You have to be in the present. First thing you must know is to forgive yourself

200
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,180
and not to think what wrong you have done, what wrong things they have done or the other, sinner and all that nonsense you don't have to think about.

201
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,980
You must know that everybody can get realization - there's no problem.

202
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,920
Only thing, you just, if you start thinking about your past and blaming yourself or feeling guilty, then it's difficult.

203
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,980
Then you catch this center here - very difficult to raise the Kundalini. So, to raise your Kundalini, you have to

204
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,260
know one thing that you are a human-being and it is your right,

205
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,300
it's your birthright to get this Atma Sakshatkar.

206
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,460
There's nothing to worry about just now, about food. You see, after realization you will know

207
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,820
what sort of a person you are and then accordingly you have to adjust your food.

208
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,120
Supposing, if you are a right-sided person, then you have to take more of carbohydrates. If you are a left-sided person,

209
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,040
then you have to take more of proteins; It depends on what sort of a personality you are because [UNCLEAR]

210
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,840
So, first you have to know what sort of a personality you are and accordingly you should deal with it.

211
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,320
Mother, once the Kundalini has been risen, will it come down again?

212
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,700
- [UNCLEAR - PLEASE BE SEATED?]
- Suppose you're practicing meditation everyday then it comes to a certain state.

213
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,360
Now, I [UNCLEAR - STOP?] meditation for next one week or one month, will it come down or will it stay where it is?

214
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,340
It depends on you. Please be seated, I'll explain. I said, sit. The Kundalini certainly rises,

215
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,320
no doubt, it has risen but sometimes, you see,

216
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:29,040
in the beginning, as like a little sapling, it may die out if you do not look after it.

217
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,780
In the same way, in the beginning you have to be little careful, must know everything about it, respect it

218
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,980
and if it is established, it doesn't. Now, as you have seen Mr. Murthy, he came to Bombay

219
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,080
for his sickness is a [UNCLEAR] his wife also and that's how he came

220
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,520
because when he got his Self-realization, he came to Madras, he started giving realization to people. They had never seen.

221
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,000
All their Kundalinis are alright, working out but some people

222
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,120
even after coming to sahaja yoga do not pay so much attention to it and sometimes may,

223
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:14,400
sometimes may lose the chance. So, you have to be little careful that within seven days you can fix up yourself

224
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,380
but some people never lose it - it's just there. Supposing, somebody has a liver problem, then the Kundalini will go to the liver to [UNCLEAR] it first

225
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,320
and then to rise it later by in Her own working you must know how to raise it.

226
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:34,340
That's a very simple technique which you can work it out for which you don't have to pay anything, it's not [UNCLEAR].

227
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,620
[UNCLEAR]

228
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,880
- [UNCLEAR]
- Can you come forward please?

229
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,940
It's a very big hall na, so we can't hear you properly and echo is there. Kya keh rahin?

230
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,840
If through Kundalini awakening people can be cured, how is it that Incarnation

231
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,340
- have will be known to suffer from disease?
- No Incarnation has suffered

232
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:17,900
- Even Ramkrishna and Ramana Maharishi
- Ramkrishna and Raman Maharishi were not incarnations.

233
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,600
and they didn't have Mother to tell them - that's the problem - otherwise they could have cured definitely.

234
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,020
You see, somebody has to tell us also, so they suffered especially Ramana Maharishi

235
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,360
but nobody was there to tell them. As soon as you catch on anything,

236
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,240
immediately you know, as a sahaja yogi. That's why it is necessary to be a sahaja yogi, so you have  the full knowledge of the Kundalini - alright?

237
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,960
[UNCLEAR]

238
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,360
[HINDI - Usspe to aur bhi nahin sunai de raha] Just stand little away from it because of echoes.

239
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,500
[UNCLEAR] Atma-sakshatkar thereby completely absorbing ourselves

240
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:12,760
when you meditate for sometime and by forgetting everything and keeping everything inside, so how do you come to know that Atma-sakshatkar is taking place.

241
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,640
- (HINDI - Mujhe to samajh nahin aaya) I couldn't understand it.
- [INAUDIBLE]

242
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,400
Alright, when, how will you know? That's a good idea. Please be seated I'll tell you, please.

243
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,820
When you get your Atma-sakshatkara first thing happens, that you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

244
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Then you feel completely Nirvichar - first is nirvichar samadhi is established,

245
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:44,320
then you feel the cool breeze in your hand - all over you can feel the cool breeze; This is the beginning.

246
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:52,480
Sometimes you do feel little heat because it's liver problem, other diseases, then you might feel little heat but after sometime you start feeling the cool breeze.

247
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:00,460
Then you must use. By using this you'll be satisfied that you have got these powers.

248
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,700
One may go to samadhi and have bliss there but that is not the [UNCLEAR].

249
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,920
You see, Veda declared 'Satyam Gyanam Anantam'; these are the doctrines of Veda.

250
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,760
- That's why, that's why
- Satya is [UNCLEAR], Gyana is knowledge, Ananta means endless.

251
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,940
This is Your state. When this is the state in the state of samadhi, one have, have a little amount of bliss while in samadhi.

252
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:45,600
- When he comes back, when he comes back, you'll have to undergo the prarabhda so he has to [UNCLEAR]
- Alright, I'll tell you.

253
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:53,020
It means you have read too much but not felt anything - that's why but now either your prarabhda and your karmas

254
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:00,760
all these things can be sucked in by Kundalini - She's so powerful. How She sucks in that there's  the Agnya chakra - you see there.

255
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,180
This Agnya chakra - tomorrow I was going to tell you all these things but today you want to know, I'll tell you,

256
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:14,120
that on the left hand side is the Ida Nadi, the right hand side is the Pingala Nadi. Ida nadi is the

257
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,860
power of our desire and take us to our subconscious and collective subconscious.

258
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:26,760
The right side is the Pingala Nadi which caters to our

259
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,840
supra-conscious and collective supra-conscious - the future.

260
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,760
Now, left side is the one which is the Ichcha shakti, is the power of desire

261
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,420
and the another one, that's the Pingala Nadi, is the one is the reaction.

262
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,620
So, when you're doing something and you feel you are doing it, doing [UNCLEAR]

263
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:00,080
then that ego accumulates and forms an institution, as you see there, on your head.

264
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,100
Here all the conditionings - the kusanskaras - also form another institution

265
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,700
which is called as superego but you can say mana, so we have two things.

266
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,900
On one side is the superego, another is the ego. They cross each other at Agnya.

267
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,660
When the Kundalini rises, then She sucks these two things

268
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,400
by which your prarabhda, your karmas, are sucked in. It actually happens because

269
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,960
when these two are joined, this fontanel bone area becomes a calcified

270
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,640
but then the Kundalini rises, they open out like this. The limbic area is in between this [UNCLEAR].

271
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:50,800
It opens out like that and when it pierces through that, you get your Self-realization.

272
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,920
But it cannot pierce through unless and until sucked in. It sucks in quite a lot in the first beginning

273
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,200
but later on it goes on sucking more and more so you become ego-less

274
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:08,520
and all your prarabhdas and karmas are sucked in; That's the work of Kundalini - She does it.

275
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,800
It's not question of how much you have read. It's the question of experiencing -

276
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,100
you must experience. You know, even Shankaracharya, he was such a great soul

277
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:28,600
and how, there was Mr. Sharma got after him by discussion discussion so that he has written such a nice

278
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:35,400
treatise of Vivek Chudamani, which he gave it up and he just wrote Saundarya Lahiri because he knew that

279
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,780
this discussion will lead nowhere - there is no tarq about it. You have to experience.

280
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:45,060
By tarquas you are not going to reach there . You will only reach there through experience.

281
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,280
So, humbly one should ask for that experience.

282
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,900
By tarq you cannot.... logic can go up to a point because it is very linear. It moves only one direction and it again comes round.

283
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:06,420
It's rationality not logic even, it's rationality because logic could be supported by these people but it's just rationality.

284
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,460
So, one has to understand that whatever you have read has to be proved otherwise what's the use of reading everything.

285
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,320
Like Nanaka has said,

286
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,720
"Kahe Nanak bin aapa khoje mite na bhram ki khai."

287
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:30,060
Nanak says that, "Unless and until you find out yourself, the illusion will not go," so they go on reading

288
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,120
Now it's said, "You have got a headache, alright, you take Anacin." Then you go on reading, "Take Anacin, take Anacin."

289
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,960
By that your headache is not going to go; You have to do it, you have to take it. The experience has to be taken.

290
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,220
Unless and until you have the experience, it's just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and that has been quite a lot.

291
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:55,520
So, by only understanding mentally, you do not work it out. Everything that you have learnt now

292
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,220
through your books can only be actualized if you have your Self-realization otherwise it cannot be.

293
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,580
You must know all the saints they never went to any University, they never read any Vedas, nothing.

294
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,940
Like Gyaneshwara, at the age of 23 years, wrote not only Gyaneshwari but the great book called Amrut Anubhav.

295
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:21,480
I mean, two stanzas of that you cannot write, it's so deep; Only an Atmasakshatkari can understand the beauty of it.

296
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,900
and that is the level is so different from the normal level of intelligence, reading or anything

297
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:35,820
or even [UNCLEAR]. Like Namadeva, who was just a tailor; He never went to any university or anything

298
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:42,660
and he went to meet another saint called Ghora Kumhar, who was just a kumhar means a potter

299
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,260
and he was busy making some clay. With his feet he was just trying to

300
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,720
make some clay ready for his work. When Namadeva went and saw him he said,

301
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,260
"Nirguna cha bheti alok sa gunati," means, "I came to see the Nirguna, the Nirakara

302
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:10,620
and here I see in Saguna." Only a Atmasakshatkari can appreciate another Atmasakshatkari. We cannot, we cannot understand

303
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,980
because are not yet that [UNCLEAR]. Only a person who has felt this,

304
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:24,560
experiences Paramchaitanya, can make out this otherwise you cannot - we are all blind and that's why

305
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:32,100
Kabira has said, "Kaise samjhauun sab jag andha." "How can I explain, the whole world is blind," - is a fact.

306
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,500
That's why they killed so many people, tortured so many people, crucified so many; They couldn't see

307
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:47,820
because ignorance and we have to get out of the ignorance to the light, to the Truth and not just to the words - it is beyond that.

308
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,920
[INAUDIBLE]

309
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,580
- Kindly teach us the yoga today.
- Yeah, yeah She's going to tell you.

310
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,620
- Annh?
- Realization, whether You'll teach
- Very nice, please sit.

311
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,120
This is a real sadhaka, who doesn't discuss, who doesn't argue, nothing; He wants his realization. That is the sign of a sadhaka

312
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:26,440
otherwise you go on shifting from one to another all your thoughts. It [UNCLEAR] thoughts, you have to go beyond thought

313
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,360
to experience and it's for your benevolence, for the benevolence of the whole world and one must experience it.

314
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,380
So many people have written so many things, so many people have gone [UNCLEAR]. There have been five hundred

315
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,660
Gitas - what we understand Gita is very different.

316
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,660
From the way other people understand, is absolutely absurd; Somethings are so absurd

317
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,900
that surprisingly how people do not see what Krishna must have meant.

318
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,480
It's very surprising. So for that, your inner eyes have to be opened, your inner understanding has to be open,

319
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,760
your brain has to receive it's excellence, in understanding.

320
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,300
The excellence is only possible if your Kundalini rises, otherwise not possible.

321
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,060
You have spoken of the experience. The experience that we undergo in three states is very different that is the common experience of everyone,

322
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:31,320
all the audience here, so [UNCLEAR] a deep state. In deep state what happens we do not know.

323
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,960
Only in the morning when we will get up we will recognize what is the thing that has happened - we will be under the bliss.

324
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,960
So, in the two states, the former two states, we will be in the state of [UNCLEAR - PLURALITY?] all this

325
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,540
so, that is the Saguna function. Nirguna function is only in the deep sleep state.

326
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,760
Even then in that Avidya function we never come, so.

327
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,120
But this is all Avidya. What you're talking is real Avidya, I'm talking about Vidya - alright? Sit down.

328
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,600
So, I'll give you the Vidya, that's the point. You must ask for Vidya and not Avidya.

329
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,380
"Surdas ki sabhi avidya dur karo Nandlal," Surdas said this after writing the whole of Sursagar.

330
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,680
This is the situation [UNCLEAR]

331
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:26,780
But if I'm saying so, why not accept, why not accept. Supposing I say, "There's a diamond here

332
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:32,800
absolutely free available to you." Will you stop coming to that? Even from Australia you will fly out

333
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,360
but if I'm saying, it is available to you, why not have it? I mean, I can't understand.

334
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,300
I know it is fantastic. It looks something you cannot imagine

335
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,860
but is all predicted, is all predicted - it has to happen.

336
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,980
This is in Kaliyuga only you [UNCLEAR]. This is the time when people are in bhranti,

337
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,160
in illusion. This is the time it is going to happen; Is all predicted.

338
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,300
If you have read Nal Damyanti aakhyaan, once Kala was caught by

339
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:23,220
Nala by the curse of the Kali and he was so angry with Kali because he had to give up his wife and all that,

340
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,760
so he caught hold of, one day, Kali and asked him that,

341
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,840
"It's better that I kill you so that you do not put people into illusions and trouble them." So, Kali said, "Alright,

342
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,040
if you want to kill, you can kill me but you listen to my mahatma, my importance - what is my importance."

343
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,140
Said, "What is your importance?" He said, "Those people today who are trying to find, in giri, kandaras,

344
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,580
in the valleys and in the mountains, one day will be born as house-holders

345
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,980
and at the time when Kaliyuga will come, they will find the reality." But this is just, you can say, the mythology

346
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,060
but also in Nadi Granth, if you have read, by Bhrigumuni, he has clearly written - even the deities

347
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,060
are so clearly - there's one gentleman from your

348
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,260
Bangalore itself, his name was Bhujander, who has transcripted it and brought it to such an [UNCLEAR - UP TO DATE?] thing.

349
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:25,840
If you also see William Blake, he has also said the same thing and he has absolutely predicted the whole thing.

350
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:34,040
There's one [UNCLEAR] who has talked about it. Even the Rabindranath Tagore has talked about it. So, I mean, if you see to the

351
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,880
prophecies also it is to be done now and it is done. There are 40 nations who are following sahaja yoga.

352
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,720
Only unfortunate part is that in Bangalore I have come very late - that's what

353
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,920
but there are other places like Hyderabad and all that; We have lots of people who are following sahaja yog.

354
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,940
In Bombay there are 18 centers. There are 14000 people who are following sahaja yoga,

355
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,140
in Delhi there are 12000 people following, in Noida there are 14000 people following

356
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,500
so it's not something, something that is not happening

357
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:20,700
and they don't have to pay anything, they don't have to spend any money - little time has to be given - that's all.

358
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,700
About five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening and you establish yourself. It has to be, it has to be sahaja

359
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,840
otherwise in these modern times when we have not time for anything how is it going to work out

360
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,640
And it has to work out in modern times, so how do you work it out?

361
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,120
You must see if it works out or not. If it does not, you must come to the center it will work out.

362
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,620
So please, understand that it is for your benevolence. I don't need sahaja yoga,

363
00:40:52,820 --> 00:41:00,240
you need sahaja yoga. I've come all the way from England to give you sahaja yoga. So now, if you could understand

364
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:07,280
what is sahaja yoga is, it's for your benevolence, it's for your good - so why don't do it?

365
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,600
As a Mother I would say, "I've done the cooking for you." If you're hungry, you say, "Alright, Mother, let me have it."

366
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,220
But if you're not hungry, you'll ask Me, "From where did You get this, from where did You buy that, what did You get this, what did You..," but if you're hungry, "Alright, let me have it."

367
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,000
So the, all the audience is not of the same kind because they asked Me, "How do you get it?" - that's the point.

368
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,520
- Mother, as I understood [UNCLEAR]
- Come little forward

369
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,940
Mother, as I understood, the Kundalini shakti, the Grace by our meditation.

370
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,080
Now while we are doing this meditationing to raise the Kundalini Shakti, what is the purpose of this Kundalini they are raising it

371
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:16,540
to clean our karma. When the Kundalini shakti rises from the Mooladhara,

372
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,740
when it comes to the various chakras, it cleanses the karmas in those chakras

373
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,960
How does it clean? - like a car wiper going up and down, it cleans. It comes forward that is said to reach

374
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,860
the Sahastrara or whatever maybe. Now Mother, I ask you, whether

375
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,180
by stopping meditating for some days will it come down to Mooladhara?

376
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:45,500
- [Shri Mataji Laughs] Don't be so much. Listen, don't be so much worried.
- No, my point is
- You see, what I am trying to say

377
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,440
Just now let Me raise your Kundalini - alright. It won't come down normally but if you are a sick person,

378
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:00,160
- it has to attend and get there - you're sick there - you're not sick.
- Mother, my point was

379
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:08,480
the Kundalini rises and cleans a certain portion. Now [UNCLEAR] up to the Mooladhara

380
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,580
It has cleaned all the other chakras. I fall sick for one month

381
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,040
- then... No...
- Will it come down. It has already cleaned

382
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,100
- Then it will not.
- My second point is
- Hunh
- How I need for our

383
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:31,100
sakshatkar, Atmasakshatkar but we might find Atmadarshan. Now Atmadarshan will come only when all our karmas are clean.

384
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:39,420
Yeah. So, I tell you what is this that we call it the sprouting of the Kundalini is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar -

385
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:47,340
is the beginning. A small light comes in, you see and then gradually it grows and grows and then you

386
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,940
you get into a state, which we call as Nirvikalpa samadhi.

387
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:57,720
If you want you can call at that time Atmasakshatkara. It's no question of simply fighting with the words. No need to fight with the words.

388
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,820
Why say Atmasakshatkara, because in the beginning the light that comes to you is also for your Atmasakshatkar

389
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:10,120
so the sakshatkar starts. You see, if you should see Me from a distance or you see from here, it's the same.

390
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,800
Once you come closer, you see Me clearly - that's all

391
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:20,140
but to say that it is Atmasakshatkara, doesn't mean that it is a full fledged happening.

392
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,540
I understood it. The Atmasakshatkara is seeing your Atma in front of you.

393
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,820
achcha. Now what is the Atma? The same as Parbrahma. So, seeing Parbrahma in front of you is just seeing your Atma.

394
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,500
- Now what do You mean by ...
- You don't see your Atma. If you see something, then you are not that. If you see the light, then you are not the light but you become that.

395
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:50,040
Your Atma comes, the light of the Atma comes in your wisdom, which I will tell you tomorrow what happens in Atmasakshatkar

396
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:57,740
- but it is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar.
- Now next point is, we must spend most time, most of our time, precious time in meditation

397
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:05,840
- so we should not spend our time in the rituals like homa or going to the temple etc. Am I correct?
- Yes.

398
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,980
You see, once you enter in the hall, whether you are there or here, you are entered in the hall.

399
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:23,840
Alright. When you come closer in the front, you have a better view - that's different but once you've entered in the hall you are entered in the hall.

400
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,800
If you have jumped in the sea, you have jumped in the sea - alright? But how far you have gone with it, is a different point.

401
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,680
So now, I think, we can have the realization of oneself.

402
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,460
To begin with the Atmasakshatkara, which is the Kundalini awakening within us,

403
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:05,640
for that I have to make humble things to you that

404
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:14,460
you should also know what are the centers you have to cater and how to awaken those centers yourself.

405
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,260
So, it's very simple, it is a very simple method which I'll tell you. So also you can raise your own Kundalini in My presence

406
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:29,880
plus you will also know which are the centers you have to look after; It's very, very simple thing you have to do.

407
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:37,860
Nothing strenuous or in any way difficult - it's very simple. So, as I told you,

408
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,500
please you have to take the help of the Mother Earth, so you can take out your shoes - will help you a lot.

409
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,160
Just take off your shoes to touch the Mother Earth because She takes away most of our problems.

410
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,140
And take out the chappals and shoes and just put it like this.

411
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:02,260
So, best it would be that sit on the ground. If you have to sit cross-legged better to sit on the ground, just in front or put your both the legs.

412
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,300
Surprisingly, you are sitting already as people get realization; It's the blessings of the modern sahaja yoga.

413
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,980
Can you move forward some of you people? Better move forward - there's space - so man seats.

414
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,720
I wanted to a question to you all. While doing this, sometimes the mind just jumps out.

415
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,900
So, it's better now to quieten your mind.

416
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,540
Now, Kundalini is the power of Pure Desire. As you know,

417
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:09,700
Economics says that, "Desires cannot be satisfied - not satiable in general."

418
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,000
From one desire to another you try. So that means these desires that we have are not pure.

419
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:25,120
There's only one Pure Desire and the Pure Desire is, whether you know about it or not, whether you're conscious or unconscious about it,

420
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:32,820
is to be one with the Divine. Unless and until that happens, you can never be satisfied with whatever you might have.

421
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,120
So now, you have to put your left hand towards Me - it is symbolic;

422
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,400
This is very symbolic, saying, that you want your realization - this is a desire,

423
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,640
this is the desire, not pure desire, the desire that you want your Self-realization.

424
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,540
The another hand, as I told you, is the kriya, is the kriya shakti.

425
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,840
So, we have to use it to give confidence - with our confidence to nourish ourselves,

426
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:11,820
to nourish our centers on the left hand side - it is very simple. So, first you have to know that the

427
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:19,180
Spirit resides in our heart, so put our hand on the heart.

428
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,140
The peetha of the Spirit is here, on the fontanel - peetha,

429
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:30,080
is the seat but the Spirit actually resides here in human-beings, in the heart.

430
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:38,540
Now, you must know that you are the Spirit - that's true

431
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:47,100
but if you are the Spirit, also you are your master, your guru because your Spirit guides you.

432
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:56,420
So, then you put your right hand - we've got to work on the left hand side - on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

433
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,540
This is the center of our guru principle, guru tatwa, left hand side.

434
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,360
upper portion of your abdomen, over here,  upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

435
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,300
Now, this is the principle of your mastery. This is

436
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,780
been created by great saints and great masters  - satgurus.

437
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,040
Then, you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

438
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,120
which is the center of Shudh Vidya, of Pure Knowledge.

439
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:48,560
Now, this Shudh Vidya, pure knowledge manifests through your Central Nervous System. You become

440
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,180
conscious of it, know through your awareness, work through your Central Nervous System.

441
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,520
Then, you have to again raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

442
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,640
Then, you have to raise your right hand on your heart.

443
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:19,300
Now, you have to raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and  your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

444
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,220
Now, this is the center which is called a [UNCLEAR] guilt

445
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:30,120
when people say [UNCLEAR]. You forget the past - you have to forgive yourself,

446
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,980
forgive yourself absolutely. Turn your head to your right. Now, you have to

447
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:44,960
put your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides and put down your head.

448
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:52,680
You have to press it hard on both the sides. This is a center where you have to forgive everyone.

449
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,200
Now, you have to take this hand on the back-side of your head and push back your head,

450
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,640
look upward and here is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness

451
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,240
from the All-Pervading Power but you're not to feel guilty, you're not to count your mistakes.

452
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,620
Then you have to stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of this

453
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,560
fontanel bone area, which is taalu, which was a soft bone in your childhood, press

454
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:38,200
properly you put it there and push back your fingers, push back your fingers and press it hard.

455
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,360
Press it hard. Now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise,

456
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,400
slowly, clockwise, don't move your hand but move your scalp.

457
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,660
Vibrations through the scalp, push back your fingers - this is important - seven times

458
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:05,060
because there're seven seats of these seven centers in our brain.

459
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:28,080
Now, that's all we have to do. Now we have to close the eyes. Before closing the eyes,

460
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,840
I've to tell you again and again, that we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

461
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:41,380
We have to be prasanna because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God and we should not blame ourselves for anything,

462
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:48,920
we should not be sorry for anything but in the present you're sitting here

463
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,920
about to enter into the Kingdom of God, so you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

464
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:02,160
not  to feel guilty, not feel any way, feel diffident; Every person is capable of getting realization.

465
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:10,160
Some people may not get today but [UNCLEAR] if they come to the center, all of them will get and you all can get your Kundalini

466
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,980
properly fixed with Atmasakshatkar - no doubt about it.

467
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,700
It has worked in thousands of people, so why not it will work in you also.

468
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,760
So, if you have anything black thread or anything tied or something like tight on your waist

469
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,280
or tight on your neck, you can little bit loosen it or if there are any malas or anything - of course, mangalsutra you can have.

470
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,020
Rest of it, any malas of, say, Rudraksha or anything like that, please take it off - that's all.

471
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,660
Now, put the left hand towards Me. Firstly, you should be comfortable

472
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,740
and sit in a way that is not slouching, neither very straight but in a simple manner.

473
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,200
Put your left hand towards Me and the right hand

474
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,660
you have to put it on your heart. Now please, close your eyes.

475
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:29,920
[Hindi - Baat suno] Listen to Me. [INAUDIBLE]

476
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:38,880
[INAUDIBLE]

477
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:48,080
Now, please close your eyes and unless and until I'll tell you, please don't open your eyes

478
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,100
because your attention has to be inside that's why please don't open your eyes.

479
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:06,420
Here, you have to ask Me a question -

480
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,500
as we ask a computer we have to ask a question -

481
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,820
very important question - you can call Me Mother

482
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,180
or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

483
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:32,080
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question, three times, in your heart.

484
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,580
Ask this question, three times, in your heart, "Mother am I the Spirit?"

485
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,100
Ask this question three times. [ASIDE - Just a minute, hello.]

486
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:12,420
[INAUDIBLE]

487
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:22,920
[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] sit in the front. Go and see what's the matter.

488
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,940
Now, if you are the Spirit, if you are the Spirit

489
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,780
then, you are your master also, you are your guru.

490
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,460
Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

491
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,100
and press it hard on your stomach, left hand side.

492
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,840
Press it hard and here, you ask Me a question, "Mother,

493
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,740
am I my own guru, Mother, am I my own master?"

494
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:08,540
Ask this question three times. Please put your both feet apart from each other [UNCLEAR]

495
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:14,480
We should not be [UNCLEAR], please put them apart. Ask this question now, "Mother,

496
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:21,460
am I my own master, Mother, am I my own guru?" ask this question three times.

497
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,900
Now, I respect your freedom.

498
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:05,220
The Shudh Vidya or the Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you

499
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,140
unless and until you want in your own freedom - I respect it, so

500
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,400
now, put your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

501
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:29,760
and ask by saying, "Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

502
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,400
Please say it six times. Six times you should say. You should say it six times.

503
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:48,100
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

504
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,800
Six times because this center has got six petals.

505
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:14,360
As soon as you say that, your Kundalini starts moving upward.

506
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:19,620
Now we have to nourish the upper centers with our confidence.

507
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:31,320
Don't doubt, keep your mind open, keep your heart open, don't doubt, otherwise Kundalini will not rise.

508
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:44,420
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

509
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:51,240
Here, with full confidence, you have to say

510
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:57,600
ten times, "Mother,

511
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:06,020
I am my own guru, Mother, I am My own master," this is the [UNCLEAR - PROPHECY?] you are talking about.

512
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:19,320
I've told you at the very outset, that the greatest Truth is

513
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:27,200
that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind,

514
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,760
you are not this ego, you are not these emotions but you are Pure Spirit.

515
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:43,140
So now, raise your right hand on your heart and here,

516
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:48,980
with full confidence, you have to say,

517
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:00,860
twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

518
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,040
"Mother, I am the Spirit," please say it twelve times.

519
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:35,480
We have to know that this All-Pervading Power is the

520
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:42,500
ocean of love, of bliss and of joy.

521
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,980
It's the ocean of knowledge but above all

522
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:56,180
it is the ocean of forgiveness, so whatever mistakes we commit

523
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:04,500
or whatever, so called, sins we commit, can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

524
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:13,880
So, please forgive yourselves. Now, with full confidence, put your right hand

525
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:20,800
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn round your head towards the right.

526
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:26,480
Here you have to say, again with full confidence, three times

527
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,140
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say this.

528
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,580
"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " please say it - this is the worst center we have

529
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:43,880
and this all the kinds of problems like spondylitis, like angina.

530
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:04,640
Now, we have to forgive everyone.

531
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,560
You might say that it's not easy to forgive

532
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:18,440
but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - it's a myth - and when you don't forgive,

533
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:24,280
you play into wrong hands. So now, you raise your hand

534
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,920
and put it on your forehead across and

535
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,900
put down your head, as much as you can and press it hard.

536
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,660
Here you have to say, without [UNCLEAR - ASKING?] whom you have to forgive

537
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:52,660
or for what you have to forgive, you just - not how many times but from your heart,

538
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:59,720
"Mother, I forgive everyone." It's a very powerful center here

539
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,300
Get rid of all the [UNCLEAR - FANTASTICAL?] ideas.

540
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,440
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

541
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:27,500
and push back your head, as much as you can, on that line.

542
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:34,120
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes and things,

543
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,880
just for your own satisfaction you have to say,

544
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,440
"O Paramchaitanya, O All-Pervading Power of love

545
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,860
please forgive me if knowingly or unknowingly I've said something

546
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,860
or I've done something which is wrong." Just say it from your heart again

547
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:05,240
but don't count your mistakes, don't feel guilty.

548
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,600
Now, stretch your hand

549
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:28,420
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

550
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:34,780
which was a soft bone in your childhood - it is called as taalu. Now,

551
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:40,540
put down your head as much as you can, press it hard

552
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:47,760
[UNCLEAR] and push back your fingers. Now, you must know

553
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:56,620
[UNCLEAR] I cannot give you Self-realization, unless and until you want it

554
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:03,840
in your freedom, as this freedom as this freedom has to be respected for you to get the ultimate freedom.

555
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:10,620
So, you move your hand seven times clockwise saying ten times,

556
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:19,300
"Mother, please give me my Self-realization." Just say it seven times moving your scalp.

557
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,160
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

558
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:29,520
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

559
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,620
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

560
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,740
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

561
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,100
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

562
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,100
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

563
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,400
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

564
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,460
Now, please take down your hands. Open your eyes.

565
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,700
Put your right hand towards Me, like this and bend your head

566
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:17,680
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your scalp but don't touch it -

567
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:25,700
keep it away from it and see for yourself. It is you who has to certify; Nobody else is going to certify.

568
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:35,320
Just see if there's a cool breeze coming out. Some people might get some heat - doesn't matter. After sometime it will cool down. See for yourself.

569
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:47,900
Put your left hand towards Me and now again put down your head and see with your right hand.

570
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:54,120
Some people get it quite far it's like this. They just [UNCLEAR]

571
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:59,320
but start getting cool breeze slowly emitting from this.

572
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,900
We have no fans, nothing , so not to doubt. Now, again put your right hand

573
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:18,700
and again put your head down and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

574
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:32,740
Now, raise your both hands and ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

575
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,220
"Is this the cool breeze of the All-Pervading Power?"

576
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,060
" Is this the cool breeze of Param Chaitanya?"

577
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:49,380
Just ask these questions, any one of them, three times, looking upwards.

578
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:02,360
Now, take down your hands. Now, watch Me without thinking [UNCLEAR - IF YOU CAN DO IT?]

579
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:20,020
Now, those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

580
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,480
So nice to see. This is the experience!

581
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:39,680
Now, how to work it out? What is this Power? You have to come to our center.

582
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,000
In any case  you come tomorrow.Those who haven't felt, you have to feel tomorrow.

583
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:54,520
All of you will feel it and I'll tell you clearly what is this Power and how it works.
