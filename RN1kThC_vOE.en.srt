1
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:18,604
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

2
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:26,222
that the last work of the Divine,

3
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:31,298
of opening the last centre

4
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:41,444
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

5
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:09,578
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

6
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:30,597
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

7
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:49,294
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

8
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:55,120
how things are worked in the heavens.

9
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:12,967
It is your fortune and God’s love

10
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:18,582
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

11
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:33,074
Without this happening, there could not
have been

12
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:43,381
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

13
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:56,469
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

14
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:04,267
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

15
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:24,321
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

16
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:40,139
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

17
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:52,517
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

18
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:14,167
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

19
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:24,775
and, with the permutations and combinations

20
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:35,601
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

21
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,015
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

22
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:55,913
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

23
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,393
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

24
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:20,893
and the whole thing came on this Earth

25
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:28,785
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

26
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:42,759
with such a tremendous force,

27
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:52,505
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

28
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:05,035
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

29
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:15,966
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

30
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:43,171
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

31
00:08:50,870 --> 00:09:01,494
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

32
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:13,100
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

33
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:20,197
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

34
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:25,479
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

35
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:41,429
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

36
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:56,189
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

37
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,916
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

38
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:18,454
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

39
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,122
on their golden seats,

40
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:38,874
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

41
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,700
like a big dome,

42
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:53,348
and opened it,

43
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:57,980
and then this torrential rain

44
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:04,512
completely drenched me

45
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:16,333
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

46
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:32,006
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

47
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:37,209
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

48
00:11:51,701 --> 00:12:00,761
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

49
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:13,908
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

50
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,637
and I became absolutely silent.

51
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:39,123
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

52
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,233
But I saw all stones.

53
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:08,282
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

54
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:20,240
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

55
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:26,173
appearing like inflated flames.

56
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:39,887
It is a thing which is seen by many people

57
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:51,757
but to see it pour that torrential rain

58
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:01,772
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

59
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:11,376
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

60
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:21,707
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

61
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:33,383
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

62
00:14:37,064 --> 00:14:42,864
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

63
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:53,875
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

64
00:14:55,932 --> 00:15:00,694
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

65
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:04,411
you cannot see its beauty;

66
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:13,946
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

67
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:20,299
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

68
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:36,100
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

69
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:43,725
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

70
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,736
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

71
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:05,082
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

72
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:30,922
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

73
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:50,515
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

74
00:16:57,804 --> 00:17:05,996
and you are drawn out to people

75
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:14,923
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

76
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:30,890
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

77
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:46,012
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

78
00:17:51,887 --> 00:18:03,518
And even if you desire to ope
 the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

79
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:17,831
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

80
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:22,859
has to be through human beings.

81
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:37,120
The power could be with you,

82
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:42,886
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

83
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:56,824
All my life I had not known many
realised-souls.

84
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,401
How to get them?

85
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,971
How to work it out?

86
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:17,089
So I started looking out for people,

87
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:26,663
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

88
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:34,789
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

89
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:43,339
and when she came to me she felt
very peaceful.

90
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:50,476
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

91
00:19:53,676 --> 00:20:02,382
And in my company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

92
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:12,381
And her brain would be covered with clouds

93
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:17,847
and darkness.

94
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:24,321
Again and again I had to enlighten it

95
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,393
but she did not get her Realisation.

96
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:39,283
Most of the people who came to me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

97
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:47,945
This capacity I had from childhood.

98
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:54,602
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

99
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:03,228
but they had to be very earnest – aartha.

100
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,079
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

101
00:21:14,855 --> 00:21:17,717
because I was not living in the forest,

102
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:26,573
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

103
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:39,246
and they were not that earnest, that
aartha,

104
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:46,898
and I had to do this work among them.

105
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,617
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

106
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:01,066
and the false [one] in which they live?

107
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:17,740
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see me

108
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:24,654
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

109
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:33,385
and it worked in her.

110
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:41,736
That was not the happiest day,

111
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:50,288
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

112
00:22:55,474 --> 00:23:00,584
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

113
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:11,741
We had a programme in Bordi

114
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:17,150
in ’70,

115
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:24,602
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

116
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:37,068
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

117
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:45,564
and they started talking of favouritism.

118
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:54,722
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

119
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:06,936
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

120
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:15,434
I was in a great fury.

121
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:22,189
I had never gone into such a fury before

122
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,736
and I lashed all of them.

123
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:37,364
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

124
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:46,279
That was the greatest moment.

125
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:52,559
Then many got, one by one.

126
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:00,898
Three of them who were traveling back,
got Realisation.

127
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,655
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

128
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:17,792
So the mass evolution started.

129
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:26,847
Sahasrara is your awareness.

130
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,425
When it is enlightened

131
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:40,126
you get into the technique of the Divine.

132
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:44,753
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

133
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:49,084
and the technique that you follow.

134
00:25:55,521 --> 00:26:04,869
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

135
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:21,934
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

136
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:33,534
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

137
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:41,422
When your Sahasrara opens out

138
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:50,782
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

139
00:26:56,323 --> 00:27:02,626
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

140
00:27:08,581 --> 00:27:17,309
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

141
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:30,697
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

142
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:41,320
and your nadis get enlightened;

143
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:48,614
not all of them,

144
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,386
quite a lot of them;

145
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:56,058
not all the length,

146
00:27:56,877 --> 00:28:01,127
but quite the peripheries.

147
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:08,459
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

148
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:13,504
So many things happen

149
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:20,528
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

150
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:30,666
 With the light you see their relative
positions.

151
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:41,458
I mean you do not see, but it work
 in your conscious mind.

152
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:52,913
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

153
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:10,338
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

154
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,032
It becomes one with your attention.

155
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:25,509
Wherever your attention goes

156
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:30,648
you act in a collective way.

157
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:38,212
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

158
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:46,189
The attention itself is effective.

159
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:52,605
Your attention is very important,

160
00:29:54,948 --> 00:29:59,461
your desires are even more important.

161
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:10,926
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

162
00:30:16,184 --> 00:30:19,525
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

163
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:27,485
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

164
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,989
The priorities change very fast.

165
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:46,951
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

166
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:53,242
may not find that happening

167
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:01,129
but those who are over mentally developed,

168
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:09,057
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

169
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:15,287
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

170
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:20,146
They want to see that it is logical.

171
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:32,292
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all,

172
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,523
we have some people like that among us.

173
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,647
They just became and they never questioned.

174
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:54,115
They just settled down.

175
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,702
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

176
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:05,143
above all they are spiritual.

177
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,990
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

178
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:14,231
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

179
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:22,830
First of all you have to put down your ego

180
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:27,789
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

181
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,346
Also the super-ego must be reduced

182
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:42,409
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

183
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:52,506
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

184
00:32:52,739 --> 00:33:00,615
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

185
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:14,424
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

186
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:28,073
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

187
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:36,964
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

188
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:41,842
it closes back.

189
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:45,551
That’s like a poison.

190
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:52,240
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

191
00:33:56,353 --> 00:34:00,474
If you go about with the poison

192
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:06,925
then it again closes.

193
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:17,438
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

194
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,047
and all other problems of the ego,

195
00:34:23,248 --> 00:34:28,812
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

196
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:35,537
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

197
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:41,656
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

198
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:47,264
and wrong books,

199
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:50,594
from wrong parents maybe,

200
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:54,398
from a wrong country,

201
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,943
from a wrong livelihood

202
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:09,180
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

203
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:20,112
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

204
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,878
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

205
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:34,423
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

206
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:46,062
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

207
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:52,018
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

208
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:59,307
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of the nervous system,

209
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:03,534
central nervous system, our consciousness
itself.

210
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:16,518
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

211
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:26,910
We have to have more and more channels

212
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:34,027
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

213
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:45,980
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

214
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:59,450
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

215
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:09,547
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

216
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,271
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

217
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:29,703
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

218
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:41,033
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

219
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:48,868
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

220
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:04,895
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

221
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:09,232
that he should not have bad company,

222
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:18,861
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

223
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:25,531
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

224
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:32,304
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

225
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,929
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

226
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:56,274
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

227
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:17,852
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

228
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:30,617
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

229
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:37,838
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

230
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:46,244
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

231
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:54,141
If you are going to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

232
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:04,320
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

233
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:11,605
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

234
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:20,963
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

235
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:32,803
so all other things must drop out.

236
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,004
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

237
00:40:46,323 --> 00:40:49,572
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

238
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:56,260
that you can really correct yourself

239
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:11,799
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes part of the Divine desire

240
00:41:18,538 --> 00:41:24,233
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

241
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:33,276
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

242
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:40,912
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

243
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:47,842
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

244
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:53,774
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

245
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:05,940
For that tolerance is needed,

246
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,318
wisdom is needed,

247
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,521
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

248
00:42:21,444 --> 00:42:24,291
which you are,

249
00:42:27,538 --> 00:42:31,481
and you should talk like a prophet.

250
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:40,966
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

251
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:51,708
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

252
00:42:52,892 --> 00:42:58,899
This is not insincere or acting

253
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,761
because now you are awakened.

254
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:14,096
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

255
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:42,708
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

256
00:43:49,971 --> 00:44:00,386
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

257
00:44:05,753 --> 00:44:12,334
one has to watch one’s own growth.

258
00:44:15,288 --> 00:44:20,347
Never justify your wrongdoings.

259
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:31,826
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

260
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:39,956
We have no time to think about oneself.

261
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:48,061
You have to think of others

262
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:51,908
because others are also in your brain;

263
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:58,272
and when you start thinking of others,

264
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:04,429
talking to them about their resurrection,

265
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:17,178
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

266
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:27,709
The sensitivity will also increase,

267
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:31,595
the depth will also come in.

268
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:38,808
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

269
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:51,090
So you have to come out of your shells

270
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:58,258
and spread your wings.

271
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:04,292
All small things of mind

272
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:10,553
must be given up.

273
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:21,579
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

274
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:32,097
which has to give support,

275
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:36,815
guidance, help

276
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:41,868
and awakening to thousands.

277
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:50,250
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

278
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:59,731
establishes a new dynamism

279
00:47:01,439 --> 00:47:04,418
in this country,

280
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:08,016
I am sure

281
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:14,852
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

282
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:26,753
It will resound into their brains,

283
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:35,232
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

284
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:45,672
and they will start thinking afresh.

285
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:55,826
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

286
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:08,431
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

287
00:48:13,846 --> 00:48:17,267
They’ll come to right conclusions.

288
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:24,488
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

289
00:48:31,235 --> 00:48:35,882
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

290
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:42,532
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

291
00:48:45,257 --> 00:48:48,388
The way you treat your Spirit

292
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:54,203
is expressed in through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

293
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:09,925
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

294
00:49:14,197 --> 00:49:19,603
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

295
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,272
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

296
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:41,838
And then you can become a subtle being.

297
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:47,806
Through your conscious effort,

298
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:54,164
you can enter the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

299
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:04,539
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

300
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:11,893
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

301
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:20,310
When you start developing higher and
higher,

302
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:26,656
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

303
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:37,129
You may not have any interest in many
things

304
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:44,849
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

305
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:56,654
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

306
00:51:03,013 --> 00:51:12,184
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

307
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:25,414
So you become the master of your brain

308
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:31,712
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

309
00:51:33,684 --> 00:51:39,653
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

310
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:45,570
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

311
00:51:50,722 --> 00:51:55,024
And the light of that expands

312
00:51:56,082 --> 00:52:01,212
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

313
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:08,564
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

314
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:12,933
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

315
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:19,336
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

316
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:40,639
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

317
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:50,017
their obstinacy

318
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:54,401
and childish pranks.

319
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,304
Let the man rise

320
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:07,980
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

321
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:19,848
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

322
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:41,427
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

323
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:48,208
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

324
00:53:57,865 --> 00:54:01,843
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

325
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:06,941
meaning: must keep it clean, pure and
immaculate.

326
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:21,777
That is what is your job,

327
00:54:23,786 --> 00:54:29,442
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

328
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:41,975
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

329
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:50,891
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

330
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:08,808
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

331
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:14,721
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

332
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:22,226
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

333
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:38,826
neglected by all the deities,

334
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:45,856
because human beings really went very
wrong.

335
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:59,364
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

336
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:06,507
because this is the attention,

337
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:18,008
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

338
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:37,446
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

339
00:56:41,368 --> 00:56:47,821
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

340
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,318
and  towards the eternal life.

341
00:56:54,374 --> 00:56:58,745
Is [a] very important country,

342
00:56:59,938 --> 00:57:05,252
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

343
00:57:08,785 --> 00:57:15,564
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

344
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:24,670
They have to change their methods

345
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,529
and styles.

346
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:32,232
They should be very mild, gentle

347
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:37,127
and healthy people

348
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:44,738
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

349
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,840
so that when others see them

350
00:57:52,199 --> 00:57:55,749
[they] find that superiority in them.

351
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:04,037
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

352
00:58:04,238 --> 00:58:07,230
I am very happy about you.

353
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:16,303
May God bless you all.

354
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:21,521
Now I bless all the other centres,

355
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,871
who have prayed and are praying;

356
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:32,582
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

357
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:37,063
an enlightened one,

358
00:58:37,249 --> 00:58:42,261
that will separate them from their small
shells.

359
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:48,489
Let them expand so much,

360
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:55,456
that they become one with the whole.

361
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,791
May God bless you all.

362
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:08,846
May God bless you.

363
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:12,272
Good (…)
