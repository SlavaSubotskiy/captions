1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:16,500
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,630
See how cold it was about three o'clock.

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:33,620
Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna
did little mischief with Indra.

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:43,579
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God,
for looking after the rain.

5
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:49,060
So, Indra got very angry.

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:01:01,469
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

7
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:11,510
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger.

8
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:23,630
So he started pouring rain on all the gopas
and Shri Krishna, who were looking after the

9
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,340
cows.

10
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:42,090
And the rain was so heavy that they thought
that the whole land will be completely submerged.

11
00:01:42,090 --> 00:02:13,660
So Indra was very happy to spoil the game
of Shri Krishna, and he thought he was very

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,590
successful.

13
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:33,590
So, Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His
finger, and all these people who were getting

14
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,070
drowned, went under that mountain.

15
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:44,950
This is Shri Krishna's style.

16
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,810
My style is different.

17
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:56,380
I told Indra that you can't misbehave with
me, you can't.

18
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:06,180
So far I'm not harmed you in any way and
I'm not irritated you.

19
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:15,420
Of course it's going to be Shri Krishna's
Puja, but that doesn't mean that you should

20
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,600
try to show off your powers before me.

21
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Sometimes I wonder these Devas - Semi-Gods,
they are realized souls or not, because why

22
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,800
do they get angry like this for small things.

23
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Whatever it is, he could be reconciled and
now it's become warm, I must say.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:04:03,260
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do.

25
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:17,060
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

26
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,459
He started Sahaj culture.

27
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:31,710
Culture, I'm saying - He didn't give realization
to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

28
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,800
How?

29
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:48,660
- Before him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada
Purushotama, who was a man very particular

30
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,740
about everything.

31
00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:01,580
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

32
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,389
especially from His wife.

33
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:11,770
So He threw Her out - it was not Kali Yuga,
that's why.

34
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:25,120
And His father ordered him to go, not only
His father so much as His stepmother, to go

35
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,779
in an exile into a forest.

36
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:38,110
So He agreed, after all He was Maryada Purushotama.

37
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:46,590
So whatever His father said, He agreed, whatever
His mother said, He agreed, and went into

38
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,810
the forest, stayed there fourteen years.

39
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,780
This is the obedience to the father.

40
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,059
There was no need, His father was not God.

41
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:17,059
He was God, but in those days it was important
to make people, not only respect the parents

42
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:25,449
but also to obey them, that was the time.

43
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:37,590
In His time there were many munis, and many
saints and many also hatha yogis.

44
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:50,319
And these, even before him, used to make people
practice very strict type of discipline and

45
00:06:50,319 --> 00:07:00,879
if they did not practice the discipline, they
had to do a lot of penance.

46
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:09,759
And, so many people who tried also, never
reached the goal, because of the strictness

47
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:26,050
and complete discipline about following the
path of spirituality.

48
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,110
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior".

49
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:39,710
There they have described an American seeking
the truth, and the guru of that fellow really

50
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:48,389
really takes him to such a horrible severe
task - that my granddaughter said, I am very

51
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:52,759
angry with such a Guru, she couldn't bear
it.

52
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:01,150
So ultimately he finds that he is the existence.

53
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,400
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama.

54
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:17,990
People would leave their wives, children,
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice

55
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,960
meditation.

56
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:37,950
It was a very rigorously followed, or I should
say, a very moral society - so very moral.

57
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:49,600
But it was out of fear, the whole morality
came through fear, which is also repeated

58
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
in other religions.

59
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,350
Now I would say that Islam today, has taken
that form, it is the fear.

60
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,560
They are not doing it out of freedom.

61
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:12,080
Also Christians, same thing, and Hindus - I
don't know - halfway this side, and half way

62
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,550
that side.

63
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,810
Even among Sikhs there's terrible disciplining.

64
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:31,880
So much so that, as punishment you have to
clean the shoes of all the people.

65
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,630
I don't know if it is to beat yourself with
shoes or another.

66
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:42,440
But quite a lot of punishment is there.

67
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:56,510
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

68
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:08,690
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

69
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,740
for six days at least.

70
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:20,500
One day you might eat some sort of a food,
then you'll have to visit all kinds of places.

71
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:30,510
Now, recently they had to go, as you know,
to Amarnath, and so many died there.

72
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:38,710
So now they said "we have got Nirvana, we
died while doing this, so we have got Nirvana".

73
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:45,640
This kind of a very funny idea was existing.

74
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:54,160
That we have Nirvana now, we have achieved
whatever we wanted and now we are dead, so

75
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,020
many are dead, so those who were not dead
were repenting why they were not dead - it

76
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,850
would have been much better, they would have
got their Nirvana.

77
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:16,170
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent.

78
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:25,070
Even in India, people have very severe types,
especially in south I have seen, they do all

79
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:35,480
kinds of nonsense for the atonement or maybe
for something they are asking.

80
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,350
All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

81
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,600
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

82
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,480
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,230
So He's the one who started Sahaj culture.

84
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:13,780
He said "let us enjoy, we must have enjoyment,
Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

85
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,590
How do we have pure joy by?

86
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:29,470
- He had this rakhi bandhan by which, apart
from your wife, everybody is your sister or

87
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,470
mother.

88
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,570
I must say it is quite true about Indians.

89
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,340
Not in the north so much because of Islamic
influence, but in the south it is so.

90
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,520
In Maharastra it is so.

91
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:55,100
And then He started also this Holi, in which
you should play with colors, maybe to get

92
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,560
rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.

93
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,890
In America it is a very good idea to play
with colors and put some black on the whites

94
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:13,090
and some whites on the black and they can
see for themselves how stupid it is to fight

95
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:20,990
in the name of color.

96
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:32,630
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

97
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,170
He never tried to show off His powers.

98
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:47,170
He never tried to stand out, never would dress
up in a very special way, never.

99
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,990
Just like an out ordinary cowherd.

100
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:00,380
And His relationship with His mother, Yeshoda
- she was not His mother - was also extremely

101
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,310
beautiful.

102
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:11,940
There are so many beautiful poems written
about His childhood.

103
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:19,520
That, He's the one who is in charge of the
whole universe.

104
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:29,810
As a little boy used to put His finger into
His mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata

105
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:38,720
do that?

106
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,070
What is His thinking like a child?

107
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,190
All His actions of children.

108
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,010
Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.

109
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,470
All these little, little actions are described
very well.

110
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,040
Especially by another very great poet, Surdas,
who was blind.

111
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:05,560
His childhood is described in a very beautiful
manner and the description of His relationship

112
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,430
with His mother is very natural and very sweet.

113
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,510
It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet
is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled

114
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,130
it, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have
spoiled".

115
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:29,200
They have more interest in their things than
in their own children.

116
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:37,000
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

117
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,060
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away".

118
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:49,600
Never to scold a child for doing anything
which you think is destructive - because then

119
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,070
he will definitely become destructive.

120
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,310
So to understand a child, I think you must
read those poems, beautiful poems, which are

121
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,340
written about Shri Krishna.

122
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:14,410
I don't know how their imagination reached
that beautiful height of pure joy.

123
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:26,160
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.

124
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,590
But some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

125
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,990
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.

126
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:49,690
Now when He went to college, or we can say
in to the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.

127
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,120
The guru's wife was very kind.

128
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,880
But the guru was strict.

129
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:10,220
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

130
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:17,380
would go and bring some woods from the forest.

131
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,590
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing
is.

132
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:30,870
He went there and His friend was carrying
the food.

133
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:38,070
His friend was carrying the food and Shri
Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?

134
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:45,660
Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the
mother.

135
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,900
I mean, for the mother He could do anything,
He was God.

136
00:17:51,900 --> 00:18:01,940
So no work for the mother was menial or lower.

137
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:13,630
But the other fellow, the friend of His, he
was very hungry, so he ate all the food and

138
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,360
nothing was left.

139
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,680
So when he came down, he got very much worried.

140
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:29,710
He went and told his guru that "I ate all
the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".

141
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:40,580
The guru got very angry, very angry and he
said "now, you will be cursed with permanent

142
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
poverty".

143
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:53,750
But the mother said "no, not permanent - till
you meet Shri Krishna again".

144
00:18:53,750 --> 00:19:01,880
That's how she tried to give, we call it Upashad,
in that you give another curse, which can

145
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,870
neutralize partly.

146
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:15,640
The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very
very poor.

147
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:25,710
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

148
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:33,210
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

149
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,650
where he must be?

150
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:44,890
Now the friendship - He was a king, such intimacy
of feeling with a friend.

151
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,370
He said "I used to go with him, I used to
collect the woods.

152
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,250
I mean, imagine all these little, little things
had such a big importance for him.

153
00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,340
So, He was not only worried about the whole
world, as He should have been, but also about

154
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,640
Sudama - When will I meet him?

155
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,570
When will I see him again?

156
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,429
Where must be his house?

157
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:13,950
How he must be living?

158
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:24,020
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend.

159
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,330
Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

160
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:39,740
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

161
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:51,570
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

162
00:20:51,570 --> 00:21:03,840
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

163
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,840
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person.

164
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:20,650
How many of us know each other's names - I
mean He knows everybody's name - practically.

165
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:33,550
And how we care for them, how we respect them,
how we love them and how we have pure relationships.

166
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:42,580
Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which
is a very great thing that we should have

167
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,090
pure relationships.

168
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:57,660
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

169
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,670
and talk to men.

170
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:11,590
And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are
you women doing, talking to women only?".

171
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,760
So, I said what are we to talk to you?

172
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,670
You are talking about your office, we are
talking about our houses and homes.

173
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,690
What is there to talk to you?

174
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,710
The western culture is different, they will
force you.

175
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,460
They'll make one man sit here and next to
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,

176
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,480
then another man and then somebody else's
wife.

177
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,430
How can you have intimacy?

178
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:55,470
This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped
into immorality.

179
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:01,480
There's no need for men and women to sit like
that, what is the need, I just don't understand.

180
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,040
Compulsorily you have to sit.

181
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:15,840
I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's
job, I never liked it.

182
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,670
What is there to talk to these men, after
all, I don't know anything about banking,

183
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,880
I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange,
what it is.

184
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,750
Or I don't know profits, and this and that
- that part is zero.

185
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:39,860
Then, I don't know about office, I don't know
many other things men talk about, so what

186
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,809
is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.

187
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:53,120
And whenever I said something, I really dropped
a brick.

188
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:02,100
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

189
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,300
a soft drink".

190
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,910
So the valet came and gave me a soft drink.

191
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:18,010
The valet was having a bow, and a white shirt,
that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.

192
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:27,880
Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black
pant, all just the same - whether it is an

193
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,640
ambassador or a valet.

194
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,610
You can't make it out who is who.

195
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:56,890
So I drank, you know, and when it was finished
I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known

196
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,890
ambassador.

197
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:03,080
To me there was no difference at all, when
they are just say walking the same way, talking

198
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,910
the same way.

199
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,790
So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.

200
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:20,220
They say they have so many Embassies, for
what I don't know and there what they have,

201
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,730
always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake
hands.

202
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,730
Your hands will break, I tell you.

203
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,000
Most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.

204
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,120
Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you
know me.

205
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,840
Sometimes I used to get such heat.

206
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,510
Like yesterday you have shown that the ice
melted.

207
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,370
The same thing used to happen to me.

208
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,570
Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't
know what to do, I used to stand on one side

209
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,710
just feeling shy.

210
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:04,810
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely
A-Sahaj.

211
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:15,250
And worse than that is French method, is to
kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

212
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,450
Or to hug somebody.

213
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:30,010
The first time I gave realization to one English
gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.

214
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:43,630
I said " all right - it's just out of joy
he has done it, it's all right".

215
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:50,070
But there is no openness, there's no openness
of heart.

216
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,040
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

217
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,320
up like that, then you are useless.

218
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,420
If you go for a death also.

219
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,110
Somebody died, a great friend, a nice man.

220
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,120
So I was told I had to wear a black sari.

221
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,370
Black blouse, everything black.

222
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,620
I said, "I have no sari, black without border,
you know".

223
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,309
So they said "you don't go".

224
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,770
I said "Very good idea".

225
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,380
Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.

226
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:40,910
You are not supposed to cry or weep there,
no, you have to keep quiet.

227
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:49,960
Then when you go there, the body is lying
there, and after a prayer is said, you are

228
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,340
supposed to drink champagne.

229
00:27:52,340 --> 00:28:02,780
I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings,
for that body which is lying there dead.

230
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:09,490
And everybody very happy, and if somebody
looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong,

231
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,360
are you all right?".

232
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,750
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here.

233
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:23,290
This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to
grief.

234
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:38,870
When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it
comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.

235
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:50,370
We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever
we do, we do it spontaneously.

236
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,720
Not with deliberations.

237
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,670
We have some very anglicized people in India
also.

238
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:09,309
And the lady of the house died
and I went to see - and in India the body

239
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,950
is taken down on the ground.

240
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:20,870
So they were discussing what to do, what time
to start the funeral and all that.

241
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:27,330
So one lady, who is a very well known person
in India, she said "you should not do it before

242
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,100
twelve o'clock".

243
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,340
I said "why"?

244
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,570
She said, "Because I'll have to wear white".

245
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,280
"That's true".

246
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,560
"And I'll have to go to the bank to get my
diamonds to match with the white sari".

247
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,790
I said "What is this?"

248
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:56,470
Such filth of materialism.

249
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:07,309
It is going too far, we are going away from
our feelings, from our emotions, which are

250
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:16,240
genuine, which are there all the time, you
don't have to think about them, they exist

251
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,340
all the time.

252
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,600
But you think "Now, should I cry or not?

253
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,070
Should I laugh or not?

254
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:32,100
It's so spontaneous.

255
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,400
If you have joy, you are spontaneous.

256
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,090
You express your joy spontaneously.

257
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:54,040
Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in
a very cultured way.

258
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:02,340
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

259
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:13,740
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

260
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:26,990
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior.

261
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:45,830
It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea
of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as

262
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:56,860
a great relief to Indian people because they
were following Shri Ramachandra.

263
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,620
But then abandonment started.

264
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:15,110
The problem is, if you make them strict, they
become like starched clothes I think, that

265
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,600
you can't wear them.

266
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,980
Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy,
you must enjoy, all right, you allow them,

267
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,320
do what you like.

268
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,429
If you allow them to do what you like, then
they start doing all kinds of things.

269
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:44,090
In India, we had lots of horrible things,
which I dare not even tell you - in the name

270
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,090
of enjoyment.

271
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:55,400
But Shri Krishna Himself has been very much
misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.

272
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:03,049
He was a great poet and he used Krishna and
Radha as Romeo and Juliet.

273
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:11,330
That's the greatest insult to the purity of
their relationship.

274
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:17,309
You must have seen many pictures like that,
in Kangra Shaili, and this shaili, and that

275
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:18,309
shaili.

276
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:25,380
It's all nonsense.

277
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:40,740
They could not show the reality of their relationship,
but some sort of a very vulgar expression.

278
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:49,330
Because I think these poets and these artists
at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings

279
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:59,200
within themselves and they used Shri Krishna
for that.

280
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,940
All kinds of romanticism is attached.

281
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,320
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood
Shri Krishna.

282
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,200
But there's a nice story about Him.

283
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:28,929
That once, His wives, He had many wives, that
is also another controversial point.

284
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:39,030
He had many wives, because these were sixteen
thousand powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken

285
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:47,810
birth and were captured by one king and kept
in the prison.

286
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,270
So He had to release them, they were released.

287
00:34:54,270 --> 00:35:01,930
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,
He was a young man - so He married all of

288
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,990
them.

289
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,060
That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

290
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,980
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers.

291
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:22,710
For a young man to keep sixteen thousand women
like a harem, what people would have thought

292
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,210
of Him.

293
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,310
So He married all of them.

294
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:38,550
And another point about His life is, that
once these all these ladies, and He had also

295
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,700
five wives.

296
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:48,580
These five wives were the causal of the five
elements.

297
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,770
So He had to go.

298
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:04,000
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint.

299
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,560
And the river, which was there, was all completely
flooded.

300
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,480
So, they came to Shri Krishna and told Him
that "How are we to cross? - because this

301
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,600
is over flooded.

302
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,880
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

303
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,420
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

304
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,730
it in India nowadays, a big politics.

305
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:49,099
So you go and tell her that "Oh River, if
Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality,

306
00:36:49,099 --> 00:37:02,230
perfect brahmachari, if that is the truth,
you go down".

307
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:09,710
And the river went down - and they crossed
over.

308
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,220
Then they went and worshipped the saint and
when they came back to the bank of the river

309
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,359
it was again very much flooded.

310
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,990
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?".

311
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,020
He said "How did you come?".

312
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:31,859
They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked
us to tell the river".

313
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:40,960
"Alright, you go and tell the river that this
saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing",

314
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:49,830
while they saw him eating plates after plates,
if this is the truth, then you better recede.

315
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:57,540
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down.

316
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:04,060
They were amazed that this man ate such a
lot of things and this river has gone down

317
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,160
thinking this is the truth.

318
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:16,720
That means -
what has been their character?.

319
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,690
They're abhogis.

320
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:32,880
They're abhogis means, they do not get, indulge
into it, they eat, all right, but they don't

321
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,920
care, they don't have that feeling of eating,
and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing

322
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,150
of the kind, they are just eating.

323
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:54,480
And this gentleman with seventeen, I should
say sixteen thousand and five wives, is called

324
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,120
as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.

325
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:06,850
They are in Sar state.

326
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:14,900
With such a great immaculate personality like
Shri Krishna, the way they have created this

327
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,180
nonsense of romanticism.

328
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:32,990
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have.

329
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:43,450
As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became
free from all the rules, regulations and got

330
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,480
abandoned.

331
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:54,330
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

332
00:39:54,330 --> 00:40:04,470
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world.

333
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:11,119
They don't know what sin they are committing,
for thousands and thousands of people in the

334
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:23,450
world have taken to all kinds of very destructive
ugly ideas.

335
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:32,240
Freud, all right, he's ousted - finished,
he's done already a great harm.

336
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:44,619
But what about these films, they are now very
much impressing our Indian directors.

337
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:50,210
I think all these directors are guiding Indians
to hell.

338
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:55,609
The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.

339
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,810
For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.

340
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:12,339
Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it,
it has gone that bad.

341
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:18,900
Then other things have started with this freedom
that we have.

342
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:31,150
Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, He would
never have put any oil in His head, He would

343
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:36,020
have never combed His hair, as He must have
His [indistinct].

344
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:42,560
And He might have worn some mod dresses from
America.

345
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,599
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

346
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,760
All the junk now has gone all over the world.

347
00:41:50,760 --> 00:42:04,480
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing
countries.

348
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:12,099
Only thing, when it was declared that they
have AIDS - people used to buy even second

349
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:16,310
hand from the tourists - they threw away all
that.

350
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:23,810
They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs
all over.

351
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:29,050
It's a destructive force.

352
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:41,150
It's a destructive force, which is very active
in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many

353
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,920
Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.

354
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:57,440
And when they are destructive they are not
hypocritical, that's they think is a very

355
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
great quality.

356
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,990
But at least with hypocracy you can save some
people but when it's just an open thing everybody

357
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,790
starts doing that.

358
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:17,910
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

359
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:34,060
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

360
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:41,420
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

361
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
ten?

362
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,339
One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom
that is finished, third one comes up like

363
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:50,130
a mushroom.

364
00:43:50,130 --> 00:44:01,270
And the most fertile land is America.

365
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:07,480
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna.

366
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:17,220
Especially Shri Krishna should really start
using His Sudarshana Chakra, would be a good

367
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,440
idea.

368
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
The time has come.

369
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,310
That's why I gave you the conch.

370
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:30,150
To declare the time has come to clean this
America.

371
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,190
That is the thing we have to do.

372
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:42,070
Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must
awaken within you yourself that consciousness,

373
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:48,360
that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.

374
00:44:48,360 --> 00:45:00,470
And by your communication, because He's collective,
by your speech, by your songs, by all that

375
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:12,440
you use to communicate with others, should
carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion,

376
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,250
of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

377
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,960
MAY GOD BLESS YOU !!!
