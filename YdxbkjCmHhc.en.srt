1
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:09,953
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

2
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:15,956
we have gathered here

3
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:23,321
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

4
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:32,414
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

5
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:37,562
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

6
00:07:37,763 --> 00:07:42,835
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

7
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:47,551
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

8
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:54,380
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

9
00:07:54,581 --> 00:08:00,448
and that you can do this Puja performed.

10
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,599
It's your right.

11
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,615
You are chosen for this.

12
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:11,768
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

13
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,234
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

14
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:21,786
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

15
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:33,653
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

16
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,468
These are specially created cells

17
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,590
through the working of the Swadishthana.

18
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,988
Passing through all the chakras,

19
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,285
when they arrive at Sahasrara

20
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:09,717
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

21
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:18,892
without getting involved into

22
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:23,633
other elements in the body.

23
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:33,063
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

24
00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:40,282
are not to be involved with the other cells -

25
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:44,484
human beings,

26
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:49,044
of the body of this universe.

27
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:57,948
The first thing that happens

28
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,154
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

29
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:07,222
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

30
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:11,733
So, many things he transcends:

31
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,707
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

32
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,150
Time is his slave.

33
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:23,264
If you have to go somewhere

34
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:29,575
then suddenly you discover

35
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:37,393
that everything is working about the same time

36
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:41,273
when you are able to do it.

37
00:10:41,696 --> 00:10:50,104
Like you are, say, to catch a train

38
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:53,972
and you arrive late at the station,

39
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:58,918
you find the train is late for you.

40
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:05,902
Things work out in such a way that you feel

41
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:13,587
they are all active for your complete convenience.

42
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:18,295
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

43
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:22,473
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

44
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:28,500
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

45
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,419
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

46
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,284
you just don't do it.

47
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:38,502
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

48
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,299
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

49
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,062
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

50
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:52,893
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

51
00:11:53,094 --> 00:12:00,607
either with lust,
greed, at something,

52
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:04,407
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

53
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:17,039
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

54
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,958
means the attention loses its dharma.

55
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,165
The dharma of the attention are such that

56
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:36,839
we have to put

57
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,422
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

58
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:49,438
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

59
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,991
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

60
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:02,074
and when they attack us,

61
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:07,677
then

62
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:13,496
we have to have some measures to control it.

63
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:18,665
So we build up our dharmas,

64
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,702
our rules and regulation,

65
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:26,149
and control them, the dharmas,

66
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,217
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

67
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:35,621
This is the greatness of human beings,

68
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:42,472
that they have made their own dharmas

69
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,640
established on top of the lower dharmas.

70
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:50,005
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

71
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,344
It has to be in four valences;

72
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:55,130
it acts according to the four valences,

73
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,375
it cannot make it six.

74
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:04,207
But human beings can make

75
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,676
those valences established which are supposed to be

76
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:12,650
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

77
00:14:12,975 --> 00:14:18,002
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

78
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:21,117
means, you don't have need,

79
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,410
there’s no need,

80
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:29,050
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

81
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:31,378
You don't have to discipline,

82
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,910
but you get disciplined automatically.

83
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:38,560
That is the first sign of a person

84
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:44,146
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

85
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:47,037
Attention doesn't get attached

86
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:52,656
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

87
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:58,458
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

88
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:05,365
So you become ‘kalateet’.

89
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:07,977
You become ‘dharmateet’.

90
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:11,256
You become ‘gunateet’.

91
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:16,191
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

92
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:20,708
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

93
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:27,015
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

94
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:29,872
of your attention.

95
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:36,558
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

96
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,743
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

97
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:50,823
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

98
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:56,150
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

99
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:59,116
which is ‘satvika’.

100
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:04,336
Where a person tries to control

101
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:11,339
all his enemies of lust, anger,

102
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:18,529
pride, vanity, attachments

103
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,511
and greed.

104
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:29,372
All these restrictions

105
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,484
on the attention get lost

106
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:40,012
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

107
00:16:40,213 --> 00:16:45,541
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

108
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:55,472
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

109
00:16:55,673 --> 00:17:00,124
and you become ‘satgunis’-

110
00:17:00,325 --> 00:17:03,983
means virtuous,

111
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:10,798
but not by discipline,

112
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:14,484
but spontaneously.

113
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:18,061
You become righteous spontaneously.

114
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,652
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

115
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:26,131
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

116
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:33,807
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

117
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:38,070
in the sense, in front of the temples.

118
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:44,204
According to laws, we should not have temper,

119
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:50,778
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

120
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:55,198
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

121
00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:01,760
which is not to be analyzed,

122
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:06,536
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

123
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:11,322
the killing of the rakshasas,

124
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,725
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

125
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:18,894
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

126
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:22,891
they are all dead already.

127
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,976
They all get explained because you go beyond.

128
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:33,690
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

129
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,718
Only the one who can control is beyond.

130
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,794
The one who is in it cannot control it.

131
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:48,351
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

132
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:55,205
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

133
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:59,296
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

134
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:13,632
But, when it comes to the knowledge

135
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:18,690
about such a person, you cannot think,

136
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:26,289
because such a person is beyond thinking.

137
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,289
You cannot describe

138
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,169
because such a person cannot describe.

139
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:40,624
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

140
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:45,067
take the poison?

141
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:52,427
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

142
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:58,879
That's beyond human comprehension.

143
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,826
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

144
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:06,896
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

145
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:11,563
Your certificates come from God Almighty

146
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:17,115
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

147
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:23,136
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

148
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,818
So you reach a state

149
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,933
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

150
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,235
means ‘without’,

151
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:44,610
without.

152
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:52,006
So such a person

153
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:56,597
is without thought; he doesn't think.

154
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:07,460
Such a person is without greed,

155
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:12,973
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

156
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:21,202
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

157
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:30,709
out of which nothing is left out.

158
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,936
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

159
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:38,877
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

160
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:43,679
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

161
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,604
because it reaches a point all the time

162
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:52,424
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

163
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,328
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

164
00:21:56,753 --> 00:22:02,487
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

165
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,210
Vacuum of all the negative,

166
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:18,080
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

167
00:22:24,674 --> 00:22:28,736
Such a person is eternal being.

168
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:33,536
Nobody can kill,

169
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:39,611
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

170
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:46,582
The anger

171
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:52,648
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

172
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:56,777
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

173
00:22:56,978 --> 00:23:08,870
He is not elated by praises

174
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:14,915
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

175
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:19,201
the boons of the ego.

176
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:37,368
So the third state where he reaches,

177
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:43,273
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

178
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:45,359
Nihi.

179
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:53,482
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

180
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:59,409
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

181
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,297
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

182
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:06,906
But the word is 'Nihi'.

183
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:10,661
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

184
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:15,779
 ‘nih’ -

185
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:22,099
that means

186
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,956
‘sheer’.

187
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:36,666
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

188
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:46,371
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

189
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:53,806
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

190
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:07,007
Like when you say

191
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:15,048
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

192
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,663
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

193
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:23,153
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

194
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:29,979
But this word is used,

195
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,322
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

196
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:42,291
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

197
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:48,453
without or devoid of.

198
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:54,163
The another form is:

199
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:57,809
the only - absolute;

200
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:03,636
the absolute.

201
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,469
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

202
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,338
nothing but joy.

203
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,515
It's complete freedom.

204
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:20,852
So you have all kinds of joys,

205
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:27,281
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

206
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:31,302
the joy of the Spirit.

207
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:39,473
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

208
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,705
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

209
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:48,679
where you have the joy of the play.

210
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:55,906
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

211
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,779
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

212
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,011
means, sheer absolute joy.

213
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:08,426
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

214
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,905
it means absolute.

215
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:15,087
So when you put such an adjective before

216
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,978
anything else it becomes absolute.

217
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:34,081
Thus you become absolute.

218
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:42,998
And when you are at that state of absolute

219
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:49,409
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

220
00:27:56,051 --> 00:28:00,082
But let us see what is absolute.

221
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:09,587
That means it is not relative;

222
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,142
it has no relative qualities.

223
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:17,493
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

224
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:20,404
it cannot be compared.

225
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:26,258
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

226
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,886
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

227
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,621
anything else through which we can comprehend;

228
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:39,501
it is absolute.

229
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:49,738
Whatever way you try to know it

230
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:54,149
you go away from absolute.

231
00:28:57,572 --> 00:29:05,057
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

232
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:20,788
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

233
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,350
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

234
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:30,689
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

235
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,343
means the anand of the body,

236
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:44,038
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

237
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:50,868
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

238
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,459
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

239
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:00,811
But the state has now

240
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:04,998
to be established within us is of Niranand.

241
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:10,724
Then what is the question of fear?

242
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:16,416
What is the question of talking about it?

243
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:21,501
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

244
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:26,186
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

245
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,917
There are no words for absolute to describe.

246
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:33,737
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

247
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:37,305
what remains is absolute.

248
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:45,093
So you reach the state of absolute.

249
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,624
And that is the state

250
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:55,782
a complete communication is established

251
00:30:55,983 --> 00:31:00,719
and in that communication you have nobody else

252
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,193
but the absolute within you.

253
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:15,007
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

254
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,381
That is the level to which you should aspire.

255
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:27,158
That should be the ascent,

256
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,890
which should be established within ourselves.

257
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:35,441
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

258
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:39,060
we don't have to do anything drastic.

259
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:44,722
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

260
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:48,844
the only, ‘kevalam’.

261
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,934
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

262
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:08,095
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

263
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:14,288
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

264
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:19,627
Just by surrendering you become.

265
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,129
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

266
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:32,494
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

267
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:37,184
It is absolute love,

268
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:40,885
it is absolute compassion;

269
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,916
it is absolute power.

270
00:32:58,034 --> 00:33:00,340
The words stop,

271
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:04,916
the description stops;

272
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:09,904
you just become the absolute

273
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:16,951
and feel your absoluteness through it

274
00:33:17,152 --> 00:33:20,542
with that oneness.

275
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:27,448
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

276
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,217
There’s no company needed.

277
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:38,621
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

278
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:51,093
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

279
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:57,629
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

280
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:06,326
May God bless you.
