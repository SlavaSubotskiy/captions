1
00:01:54,587 --> 00:02:00,648
I bow to all those who have found the truth

2
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:06,854
and those who are still trying to find.

3
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:14,324
The greatest problem of human beings is,

4
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:18,974
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

5
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:22,402
They don’t know what powers they have.

6
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,088
They don’t know what properties they have.

7
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:29,514
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

8
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:35,486
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

9
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:40,257
If you could just peep in your heart

10
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:45,423
and start thinking about the spiritual life

11
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:51,381
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

12
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:56,294
 treasure of powers of love,

13
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:02,444
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

14
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:09,922
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

15
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:14,483
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

16
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:18,511
 that they do not realize what powers they have,

17
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,619
 and sometimes I find they are little shy
 to talk about Sahaja Yoga

18
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:30,170
 or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

19
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,620
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

20
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,969
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

21
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,295
Unless and until you face others

22
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:50,131
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

23
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:57,871
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

24
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:04,004
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

25
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,235
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

26
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:17,995
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

27
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:20,840
 you are cleansing yourself.

28
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:28,793
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

29
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:35,364
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

30
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:43,536
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

31
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,938
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

32
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:54,016
 that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

33
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:57,832
 they all drop out.

34
00:04:58,285 --> 00:05:01,152
But we must face ourselves.

35
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,846
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

36
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:09,137
that we can become a very great people

37
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:12,902
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

38
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,186
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

39
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:19,080
It’s not the outside ambition,

40
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,738
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

41
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:29,504
All of you are quite intelligent

42
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,496
and are experts, I should say,

43
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,224
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

44
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,903
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

45
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:44,041
Do you know about yourself

46
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:48,049
what you can do, what you are capable of?

47
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,384
That’s the point where we are missing.

48
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,353
All right, it is the urge within

49
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:57,679
 because you have got your self-realization.

50
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:05,072
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

51
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:07,919
that you know the truth.

52
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:13,901
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

53
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:17,785
is to spread the truth to make

54
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:23,868
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

55
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:27,675
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

56
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:33,003
 they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

57
00:06:33,003 --> 00:06:35,585
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

58
00:06:36,336 --> 00:06:41,913
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

59
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:46,709
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

60
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,391
 by giving realizations to others,

61
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,304
by making them understand what are

62
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:58,741
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

63
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,946
What they can achieve.

64
00:07:01,156 --> 00:07:06,181
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

65
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:10,943
But this fear that we may develop ego,

66
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:14,743
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

67
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,120
You cannot.

68
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:22,001
Because the more you will meditate,
 the more you will face yourself,

69
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:28,145
you will know that you have so many great things within you

70
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:34,255
 just like a storehouse of jewels.

71
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,011
You must respect yourself

72
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:42,464
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

73
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,501
Not what you want to achieve outside.

74
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:50,347
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

75
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,160
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

76
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,916
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

77
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:04,448
of great value system within you

78
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,831
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

79
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:12,347
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

80
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:17,277
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

81
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:22,005
But as it is I find,

82
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:25,451
 the people are either money oriented

83
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:29,514
or power oriented outside.

84
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,550
Not inside.

85
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:36,176
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

86
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,629
 inside everything that you can think of.

87
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:45,944
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

88
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,600
Now, they have become great speakers.

89
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:54,256
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

90
00:08:54,457 --> 00:09:00,145
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

91
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:03,910
and that with that knowledge you change others.

92
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:07,492
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

93
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,319
You have to spread out.

94
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:13,032
This power has been given to you

95
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:16,881
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

96
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:19,634
and to be kind and gentle

97
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:23,152
and talk to people in that way that they know

98
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,485
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:34,156
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

100
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,132
 but to know yourself fully,

101
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:42,480
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

102
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:47,318
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
 millions and millions.

103
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:50,506
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

104
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:53,594
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

105
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:58,094
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

106
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:01,102
that “there must be something in me

107
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:04,132
 that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

108
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,807
and to understand the subtle system."

109
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,804
It’s a very subtle system

110
00:10:08,997 --> 00:10:12,598
and it can be known only to very subtle people

111
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,969
 and not to gross people.

112
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:20,896
But if you yourself discover yourself

113
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:25,340
 and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

114
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,394
because you are not ego.

115
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:30,486
Those who have ego, as I told you,

116
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:34,139
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

117
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:40,311
to organize things something to promote them.

118
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:43,205
They are on a very different level.

119
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,350
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

120
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:52,133
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

121
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,340
What am I?

122
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,845
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

123
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:59,594
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

124
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:03,003
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

125
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:06,064
That means you are something great.

126
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:11,408
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

127
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:15,286
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

128
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:19,335
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

129
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:22,061
But you will be an ocean of love.

130
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,645
That’s what it has to be.

131
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,671
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

132
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:30,086
I understand that these are the worst days,

133
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:33,487
 it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

134
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:37,809
But why are you here during this time?

135
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,708
To enlighten people.

136
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,475
To give them the right ideas.

137
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:47,525
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

138
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,880
 that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

139
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:56,686
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

140
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:03,456
He realized in very young age that he has to

141
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:08,094
assert on others his own value system

142
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:11,049
 by showing his own example.

143
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,853
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

144
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:21,364
still he has shown such results.

145
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,480
I have read many lives of this kind.

146
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,466
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

147
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,971
We had everywhere one person like that.

148
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,100
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

149
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:37,627
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

150
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:39,993
 who used to respect Me so much.

151
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:42,778
People would wonder why should he respect Me

152
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,627
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

153
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,676
 because he realized what I was.

154
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:52,239
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

155
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,296
Now, you people have a chance.

156
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,441
All right, I am quite old now.

157
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:01,034
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

158
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,525
Till I live I’ll work very hard

159
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:08,255
to convince you about your own,

160
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,793
your own personality, your own self.

161
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,524
That’s what I am living for.

162
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:19,592
Till you are completely convinced.

163
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:23,327
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

164
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:27,234
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

165
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,769
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

166
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:33,337
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

167
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,149
 unless and until you find out what is your personality

168
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,681
 in the real sense of the word,

169
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:48,793
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

170
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,363
Sahaja means spontaneous.

171
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:54,011
It comes spontaneously to you.

172
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:58,588
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

173
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:02,738
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

174
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,348
But that torsion area is there behind you,

175
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:10,912
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

176
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:14,326
All of you have got this, but despite that

177
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,779
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

178
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,957
You have that power within you.

179
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:25,626
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

180
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:29,617
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

181
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,944
I should we have lost him.

182
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,547
So, one day he was going to another island

183
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:42,253
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

184
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:49,580
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

185
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,024
So he came out and he threatened them,

186
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,669
 “I am going for my Mother’s work.

187
00:14:56,903 --> 00:15:00,609
How dare you bring the rain?

188
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,916
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

189
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,139
And, it was surprising.

190
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:12,334
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
 came back after five hours.

191
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:15,815
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

192
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:21,840
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

193
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:23,596
It helps us.

194
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:28,076
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

195
00:15:28,258 --> 00:15:32,359
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

196
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:36,927
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

197
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:44,043
 but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

198
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:47,093
And that I am to be supported.

199
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:52,109
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

200
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:56,733
that you are the people who are here to

201
00:15:56,963 --> 00:16:01,364
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

202
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:05,637
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

203
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,024
But, how can I do it?

204
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,623
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

205
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,250
I have to have channels.

206
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:14,493
And, these channels who know their job,

207
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:19,563
 they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

208
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,358
You are special people no doubt.

209
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,690
Otherwise why are you here?

210
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:34,235
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

211
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,594
You are a wonderful conductor.

212
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:38,390
You are an expert on that.

213
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,233
It just works.

214
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,334
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

215
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:51,357
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

216
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,193
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

217
00:16:56,408 --> 00:17:01,033
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

218
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:04,226
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

219
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,973
I am just an ordinary housewife.

220
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,733
What? It’s just My love.

221
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:15,073
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

222
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,103
 that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

223
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:24,255
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

224
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,670
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

225
00:17:27,837 --> 00:17:31,494
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

226
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:35,355
The point is, I knew what I was.

227
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:40,047
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

228
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,582
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

229
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:49,415
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

230
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,065
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

231
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:58,950
 you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

232
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,741
All these drop out like that.

233
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,960
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

234
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:13,981
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

235
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:18,195
And we should get concerned about that.

236
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,793
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

237
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,122
I went to jail, everything I did.

238
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,159
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

239
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:31,717
That was different.

240
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:35,063
But after that independence what should have happened

241
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:39,621
is to make people realize what they are.

242
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:44,390
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

243
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,414
what is the need of that country.

244
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:55,947
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

245
00:18:56,287 --> 00:19:01,103
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

246
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:05,093
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

247
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:11,114
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

248
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,646
You are so empowered.

249
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:18,924
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

250
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:23,223
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

251
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:26,757
But still all of you have to do it.

252
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:31,907
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

253
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:36,340
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

254
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:39,918
I have not changed much because within Myself

255
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:45,235
 I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

256
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,710
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

257
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:54,775
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

258
00:19:55,085 --> 00:20:02,001
 that nothing is important than to know what you are.

259
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,172
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

260
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,006
Nothing matters.

261
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:10,053
What is important is to know yourself.

262
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:14,199
I’m surprised very little has been written

263
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:17,699
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

264
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,436
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

265
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:25,482
 about Tao and meaning that what you are.

266
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,209
Tao means what you are, and he describes

267
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,860
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

268
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,463
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

269
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:42,259
 how to reach that state was not given. He only described

270
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:46,710
 people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

271
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,876
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

272
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:53,646
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

273
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,489
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

274
00:20:56,605 --> 00:21:00,874
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

275
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:05,679
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

276
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:09,263
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

277
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:11,483
 he described so beautifully.

278
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:16,351
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

279
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,094
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

280
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:24,194
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

281
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:27,714
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

282
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:32,344
 it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

283
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:35,982
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

284
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:40,131
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

285
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:43,147
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

286
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:45,794
 that you should be in your balance.

287
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:49,339
Now many people say who have given up smoking

288
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:54,390
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

289
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:57,051
That means you have lost your maryadas.

290
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:01,441
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

291
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:04,790
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

292
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,076
You must watch yourself.

293
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:09,024
You call him, “Hello Mister.

294
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:10,964
So now, what are you up to?”

295
00:22:11,073 --> 00:22:14,259
Then you will see how your mind is working.

296
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:18,307
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

297
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:23,103
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

298
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,745
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

299
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:30,142
that ocean is the lowest thing.

300
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:34,530
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

301
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:38,103
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

302
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,274
So, it keeps at the lowest.

303
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:45,580
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

304
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:50,197
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

305
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:55,176
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

306
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:58,910
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

307
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:05,143
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

308
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,081
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

309
00:23:09,246 --> 00:23:13,084
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

310
00:23:13,354 --> 00:23:18,344
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

311
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,078
At the lowest point.

312
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:25,178
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

313
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:28,206
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

314
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,820
But see that you are the lowest.

315
00:23:30,907 --> 00:23:36,055
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

316
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,191
that everything will come to you.

317
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,570
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

318
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:48,441
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

319
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,627
that you know that you are the highest.

320
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,290
You are the highest

321
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:58,900
But you are highest because you stand at the lowest point.

322
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:03,210
It’s true that I have tremendous love for the poor people.

323
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:07,760
It’s true also that I have been really very much yearning to do something

324
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:13,413
for that and that’s how we have started at least sixteen projects in India.

325
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:21,762
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

326
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:25,465
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

327
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:28,028
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

328
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:31,067
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

329
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:34,038
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

330
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,891
What is the problem there?

331
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:39,952
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

332
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,527
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

333
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,199
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

334
00:24:55,683 --> 00:25:01,656
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

335
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:07,738
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

336
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,788
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

337
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:17,275
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

338
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:24,611
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

339
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,127
And why not?

340
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:29,233
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

341
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,102
You are My children. You can do it.

342
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:36,131
But the confidence should be there that as

343
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:41,810
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

344
00:25:41,953 --> 00:25:45,649
 because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

345
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:49,543
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

346
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,456
which stands at the lowest point.

347
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,158
In the same way, it works out.

348
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:57,955
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

349
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:03,237
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

350
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,601
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

351
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:11,500
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

352
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:16,307
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

353
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:19,405
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

354
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:24,386
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

355
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,099
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

356
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:31,635
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

357
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,772
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

358
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:40,952
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

359
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:44,600
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

360
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,457
 in case your peace is established.

361
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:54,362
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

362
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,939
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

363
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:05,173
and findout what is lacking.

364
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:11,648
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

365
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:17,872
They can explode all the myths of the world.

366
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:19,483
I know that.

367
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:25,054
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

368
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,654
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

369
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:33,308
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

370
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:38,114
 then give Me this, that you show your confidence

371
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,723
 and you work it out wherever you are.

372
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,652
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

373
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,373
You don’t have to change anything.

374
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:48,833
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

375
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:54,813
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

376
00:27:55,646 --> 00:28:00,032
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

377
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:05,302
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

378
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:09,791
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

379
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:14,637
 subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

380
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:16,624
May God Bless you.
