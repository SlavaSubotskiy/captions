1
00:01:54,634 --> 00:02:00,695
I bow to all those who have found the truth

2
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:06,901
and those who are still trying to find.

3
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,370
The greatest problem of human beings is,

4
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:19,020
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

5
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,448
They don’t know what powers they have.

6
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,134
They don’t know what properties they have.

7
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:29,560
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

8
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:35,532
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

9
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:40,303
If you could just peep in your heart

10
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:45,469
and start thinking about the spiritual life

11
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:51,427
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

12
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:56,340
 treasure of powers of love,

13
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,490
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

14
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:09,968
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

15
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:14,529
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

16
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,557
 that they do not realize what powers they have,

17
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:23,665
 and sometimes I find they are little shy
 to talk about Sahaja Yoga

18
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:30,216
 or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

19
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:37,666
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

20
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:43,015
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

21
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,341
Unless and until you face others

22
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:50,177
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

23
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:57,917
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

24
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:04,050
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

25
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:11,281
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

26
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,041
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

27
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,886
 you are cleansing yourself.

28
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:28,839
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

29
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:35,410
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

30
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:43,582
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

31
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:47,984
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

32
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:54,062
 that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

33
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,878
 they all drop out.

34
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,198
But we must face ourselves.

35
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:04,892
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

36
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:09,183
that we can become a very great people

37
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:12,948
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

38
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:16,232
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

39
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,126
It’s not the outside ambition,

40
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:24,784
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

41
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:29,550
All of you are quite intelligent

42
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:33,542
and are experts, I should say,

43
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,270
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

44
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:40,949
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

45
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:44,087
Do you know about yourself

46
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,095
what you can do, what you are capable of?

47
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:51,430
That’s the point where we are missing.

48
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,399
All right, it is the urge within

49
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,725
 because you have got your self-realization.

50
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:05,118
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

51
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,965
that you know the truth.

52
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,947
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

53
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,831
is to spread the truth to make

54
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:23,914
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

55
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:27,721
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

56
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:33,049
 they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

57
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,631
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

58
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:41,959
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

59
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:46,755
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

60
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:50,437
 by giving realizations to others,

61
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:54,350
by making them understand what are

62
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:58,787
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

63
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,992
What they can achieve.

64
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:06,227
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

65
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:10,989
But this fear that we may develop ego,

66
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,789
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

67
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,166
You cannot.

68
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:22,047
Because the more you will meditate,
 the more you will face yourself,

69
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:28,191
you will know that you have so many great things within you

70
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:34,301
 just like a storehouse of jewels.

71
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:38,057
You must respect yourself

72
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:42,510
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

73
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:45,547
Not what you want to achieve outside.

74
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,393
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

75
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:55,206
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

76
00:07:55,395 --> 00:08:00,962
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

77
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,494
of great value system within you

78
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:07,877
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

79
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:12,393
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

80
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:17,323
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

81
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:22,051
But as it is I find,

82
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,497
 the people are either money oriented

83
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:29,560
or power oriented outside.

84
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:31,596
Not inside.

85
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:36,222
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

86
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:40,675
 inside everything that you can think of.

87
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:45,990
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

88
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,646
Now, they have become great speakers.

89
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:54,302
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

90
00:08:54,503 --> 00:09:00,191
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

91
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,956
and that with that knowledge you change others.

92
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:07,538
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

93
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:10,365
You have to spread out.

94
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,078
This power has been given to you

95
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,927
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

96
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:19,680
and to be kind and gentle

97
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:23,198
and talk to people in that way that they know

98
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:26,531
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:34,202
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

100
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:37,178
 but to know yourself fully,

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,526
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

102
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:47,364
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
 millions and millions.

103
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,552
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

104
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,640
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

105
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:58,140
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

106
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:01,148
that “there must be something in me

107
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,178
 that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

108
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:06,853
and to understand the subtle system."

109
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:08,850
It’s a very subtle system

110
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,644
and it can be known only to very subtle people

111
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,015
 and not to gross people.

112
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:20,942
But if you yourself discover yourself

113
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:25,386
 and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

114
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,440
because you are not ego.

115
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,532
Those who have ego, as I told you,

116
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:34,185
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

117
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:40,357
to organize things something to promote them.

118
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:43,251
They are on a very different level.

119
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:48,396
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

120
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,179
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

121
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:54,386
What am I?

122
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,891
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

123
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,640
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

124
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:03,049
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

125
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,110
That means you are something great.

126
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:11,454
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

127
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,332
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

128
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:19,381
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

129
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,107
But you will be an ocean of love.

130
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,691
That’s what it has to be.

131
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:26,717
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

132
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,132
I understand that these are the worst days,

133
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:33,533
 it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

134
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,855
But why are you here during this time?

135
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:40,754
To enlighten people.

136
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:43,521
To give them the right ideas.

137
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:47,571
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

138
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,926
 that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

139
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:56,732
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

140
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:03,502
He realized in very young age that he has to

141
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:08,140
assert on others his own value system

142
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:11,095
 by showing his own example.

143
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,899
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

144
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:21,410
still he has shown such results.

145
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:24,526
I have read many lives of this kind.

146
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,512
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

147
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:30,017
We had everywhere one person like that.

148
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,146
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

149
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,673
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

150
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:40,039
 who used to respect Me so much.

151
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:42,824
People would wonder why should he respect Me

152
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,673
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

153
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:48,722
 because he realized what I was.

154
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:52,285
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

155
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:54,342
Now, you people have a chance.

156
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:57,487
All right, I am quite old now.

157
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:01,080
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

158
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,571
Till I live I’ll work very hard

159
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:08,301
to convince you about your own,

160
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:13,839
your own personality, your own self.

161
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,570
That’s what I am living for.

162
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,638
Till you are completely convinced.

163
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,373
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

164
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:27,280
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

165
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,815
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

166
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,383
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

167
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:39,195
 unless and until you find out what is your personality

168
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:41,727
 in the real sense of the word,

169
00:13:42,077 --> 00:13:48,839
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

170
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:51,409
Sahaja means spontaneous.

171
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:54,057
It comes spontaneously to you.

172
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:58,634
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

173
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:02,784
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

174
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:07,394
But that torsion area is there behind you,

175
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:10,958
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

176
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:14,372
All of you have got this, but despite that

177
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:18,825
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

178
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,003
You have that power within you.

179
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,672
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

180
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:29,663
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

181
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,990
I should we have lost him.

182
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:37,593
So, one day he was going to another island

183
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:42,299
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

184
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:49,626
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

185
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,070
So he came out and he threatened them,

186
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:56,715
 “I am going for my Mother’s work.

187
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:00,655
How dare you bring the rain?

188
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,962
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

189
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,185
And, it was surprising.

190
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:12,380
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
 came back after five hours.

191
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:15,861
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

192
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:21,886
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

193
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,642
It helps us.

194
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:28,122
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

195
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:32,405
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

196
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:36,973
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

197
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:44,089
 but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

198
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:47,139
And that I am to be supported.

199
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:52,155
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

200
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:56,779
that you are the people who are here to

201
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:01,410
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

202
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:05,683
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

203
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:07,070
But, how can I do it?

204
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,669
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

205
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,296
I have to have channels.

206
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,539
And, these channels who know their job,

207
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:19,609
 they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

208
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:22,404
You are special people no doubt.

209
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,736
Otherwise why are you here?

210
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:34,281
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

211
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:36,640
You are a wonderful conductor.

212
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:38,436
You are an expert on that.

213
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,279
It just works.

214
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:47,380
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

215
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:51,403
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

216
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:56,239
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

217
00:16:56,454 --> 00:17:01,079
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

218
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:04,272
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

219
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,019
I am just an ordinary housewife.

220
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,779
What? It’s just My love.

221
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:15,119
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

222
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:20,149
 that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

223
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,301
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

224
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,716
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

225
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:31,540
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

226
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:35,401
The point is, I knew what I was.

227
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:40,093
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

228
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,628
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

229
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:49,461
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

230
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:54,111
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

231
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:58,996
 you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

232
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:01,787
All these drop out like that.

233
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:07,006
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

234
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:14,027
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

235
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,241
And we should get concerned about that.

236
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:21,839
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

237
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:24,168
I went to jail, everything I did.

238
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:30,205
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

239
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:31,763
That was different.

240
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,109
But after that independence what should have happened

241
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:39,667
is to make people realize what they are.

242
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:44,436
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

243
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,460
what is the need of that country.

244
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:55,993
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

245
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:01,149
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

246
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:05,139
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

247
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:11,160
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

248
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:13,692
You are so empowered.

249
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:18,970
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

250
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:23,269
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

251
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:26,803
But still all of you have to do it.

252
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:31,953
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

253
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:36,386
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

254
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,964
I have not changed much because within Myself

255
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:45,281
 I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

256
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,756
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

257
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:54,821
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

258
00:19:55,131 --> 00:20:02,047
 that nothing is important than to know what you are.

259
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:05,218
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

260
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,052
Nothing matters.

261
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,099
What is important is to know yourself.

262
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,245
I’m surprised very little has been written

263
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,745
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

264
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:20,482
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

265
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:25,528
 about Tao and meaning that what you are.

266
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:29,255
Tao means what you are, and he describes

267
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:34,906
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

268
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:38,509
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

269
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:42,305
 how to reach that state was not given. He only described

270
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:46,756
 people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

271
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,922
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

272
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,692
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

273
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:56,535
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

274
00:20:56,651 --> 00:21:00,920
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

275
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,725
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

276
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:09,309
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

277
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,529
 he described so beautifully.

278
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:16,397
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

279
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,140
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

280
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,240
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

281
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:27,760
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

282
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,390
 it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

283
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,028
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

284
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:40,177
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

285
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:43,193
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

286
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:45,840
 that you should be in your balance.

287
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:49,385
Now many people say who have given up smoking

288
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:54,436
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

289
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,097
That means you have lost your maryadas.

290
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:01,487
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

291
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,836
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

292
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,122
You must watch yourself.

293
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,070
You call him, “Hello Mister.

294
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,010
So now, what are you up to?”

295
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,305
Then you will see how your mind is working.

296
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:18,353
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

297
00:22:18,568 --> 00:22:23,149
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

298
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:26,791
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

299
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,188
that ocean is the lowest thing.

300
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:34,576
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

301
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:38,149
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

302
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:41,320
So, it keeps at the lowest.

303
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,626
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

304
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:50,243
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

305
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,222
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

306
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:58,956
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

307
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:05,189
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

308
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:09,127
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

309
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:13,130
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

310
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,390
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

311
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,124
At the lowest point.

312
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:25,224
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

313
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:28,252
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

314
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,866
But see that you are the lowest.

315
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:36,101
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

316
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,237
that everything will come to you.

317
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:43,616
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

318
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:48,487
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

319
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:52,201
that you know that you are the highest.

320
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,280
You are the highest.

321
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:59,975
But you are highest because you stand at the lowest point.

322
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:04,216
It’s true that I have tremendous love for the poor people.

323
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:08,901
It’s true also that I have been really 
very much yearning to do something for that

324
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:14,328
 and that’s how we have started
 at least sixteen projects in India.

325
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:21,933
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

326
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,386
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

327
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,949
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

328
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:30,988
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

329
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,959
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

330
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:35,812
What is the problem there?

331
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:39,873
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

332
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:48,448
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

333
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:55,120
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

334
00:24:55,604 --> 00:25:01,577
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

335
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,659
Same in our country, same in your country 
and everybody’s country.

336
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:12,709
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

337
00:25:12,836 --> 00:25:17,196
and we must have Sahaja Yogis
 who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

338
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:24,532
To be very much confident of the fact
 that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

339
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,048
And why not?

340
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,154
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

341
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:32,023
You are My children. You can do it.

342
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:36,052
But the confidence should be there that as

343
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:41,731
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

344
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,570
 because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

345
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:49,464
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

346
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:52,377
which stands at the lowest point.

347
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,079
In the same way, it works out.

348
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,876
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

349
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:03,158
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

350
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:06,522
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

351
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:11,421
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

352
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:16,228
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

353
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,326
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

354
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:24,307
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

355
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,020
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

356
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:31,556
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

357
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:36,693
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

358
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,873
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

359
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,521
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

360
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,378
 in case your peace is established.

361
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:54,283
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

362
00:26:55,025 --> 00:27:00,860
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

363
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:05,094
and findout what is lacking.

364
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,569
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

365
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:17,793
They can explode all the myths of the world.

366
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,404
I know that.

367
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:24,975
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

368
00:27:25,181 --> 00:27:28,575
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

369
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:33,229
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

370
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:38,035
 then give Me this, that you show your confidence

371
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,644
 and you work it out wherever you are.

372
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:42,573
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

373
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,294
You don’t have to change anything.

374
00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:48,754
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

375
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:54,734
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

376
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:59,953
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

377
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:05,223
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

378
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:09,712
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

379
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:14,558
 subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

380
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,545
May God Bless you.
