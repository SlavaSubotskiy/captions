1
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:26,274
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,649
Some of you have found the truth,

3
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:43,274
some of you have not found it fully,

4
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:48,023
and some of you have not found it at all.

5
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:58,024
But if you look around in today's situation,

6
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:03,767
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

7
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,017
Countries after countries are taking

8
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,891
to all kinds of wrong things.

9
00:47:13,392 --> 00:47:16,267
Lot of cold war is on,

10
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:20,017
people are killing each other,

11
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:26,642
destroying beautiful places,

12
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:34,392
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

13
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:41,267
They are all human beings created by God.

14
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,891
God Almighty has created them

15
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:49,392
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

16
00:47:51,517 --> 00:47:53,392
At this juncture

17
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:59,017
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

18
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:08,892
This is, where have we to reach --or

19
00:48:10,142 --> 00:48:12,891
is it our destiny?

20
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:18,891
Is this the destiny of human beings,

21
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:23,267
to be destroyed by each other

22
00:48:25,142 --> 00:48:28,517
for land or for anything else?

23
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:33,267
Think of the whole world as one,

24
00:48:34,517 --> 00:48:38,392
and think what's happening all over:

25
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:41,517
every day we read newspaper,

26
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:46,142
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

27
00:48:46,392 --> 00:48:50,642
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

28
00:48:51,017 --> 00:48:53,142
for no rhyme and reason.

29
00:48:57,892 --> 00:49:02,142
We have to think, what is the destiny?

30
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,891
Where are we going?

31
00:49:07,142 --> 00:49:13,267
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

32
00:49:15,392 --> 00:49:19,892
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

33
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:26,017
What's wrong with human beings is

34
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:35,891
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

35
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,891
I would call it ignorance.

36
00:49:40,142 --> 00:49:42,892
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

37
00:49:44,517 --> 00:49:47,767
they are doing these horrible things.

38
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:54,767
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

39
00:49:56,142 --> 00:49:59,642
is nothing but complete destruction.

40
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:03,517
Is that our destiny,

41
00:50:03,892 --> 00:50:07,392
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

42
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:11,267
What good are we doing?

43
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:17,517
Under the name of some sort of nationality

44
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:20,767
or maybe some religion

45
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:25,267
-- all kinds of things which are good --

46
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,891
but we are doing all wrong things.

47
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,017
Fighting.

48
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:34,767
Fighting is not the only thing.

49
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:37,517
We hate.

50
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:44,142
Anybody who can excite our hatred

51
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:51,642
is very much adorable, very much liked,

52
00:50:52,017 --> 00:50:55,517
and under his guidance we form groups.

53
00:50:57,392 --> 00:51:03,767
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

54
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:08,142
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

55
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:13,891
And this Last Judgment will really decide

56
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:19,017
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

57
00:51:20,392 --> 00:51:23,891
It's a very, very serious thing.

58
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:32,891
All of those who are aware should think about it.

59
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,517
Little patchwork here

60
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,891
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

61
00:51:39,891 --> 00:51:41,891
Whatever you may try,

62
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:46,891
unless and until you transform human beings,

63
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:49,267
they cannot be saved.

64
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:58,767
This transformation is not an impossible thing

65
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,392
-- it's not difficult.

66
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,891
This is the time for transformation,

67
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,891
this is a chance for transformation.

68
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:14,142
And within us is placed the power,

69
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:18,517
as Tao has described,

70
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:22,142
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

71
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,017
All of them have described it,

72
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:29,517
I'm not the first person to say that;

73
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:35,891
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

74
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:41,891
to understand it or to accept it,

75
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:44,891
that it should happen to you.

76
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:53,891
You are born not only to be human beings,

77
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:57,767
but you have to be superhuman.

78
00:52:58,891 --> 00:53:00,892
You have to enjoy yourself.

79
00:53:01,392 --> 00:53:05,017
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

80
00:53:05,517 --> 00:53:07,517
It should not be a curse:

81
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:11,517
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

82
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:16,517
That is why you are created.

83
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:20,891
God had no intention of creating people

84
00:53:21,392 --> 00:53:25,392
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

85
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,767
how to fight, how to save;

86
00:53:29,017 --> 00:53:33,892
but people who will live in complete harmony,

87
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:37,142
peace and joy.

88
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:41,267
That's why we are created.

89
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,891
That is our destiny -- that is,

90
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:48,142
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

91
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:56,892
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

92
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:01,017
This transformation is not difficult.

93
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:08,767
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

94
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:12,891
Hindus will go to the temple;

95
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,642
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

96
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:18,392
Christians go to the church;

97
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:20,892
they'll think they have done very good.

98
00:54:21,642 --> 00:54:25,267
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

99
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,891
What have they achieved?

100
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:30,767
Face yourself, please.

101
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:34,891
Face your limitations.

102
00:54:35,267 --> 00:54:37,392
Face your tribulations.

103
00:54:37,767 --> 00:54:40,892
Face your problems and see for yourself:

104
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:44,267
have you been able to solve your problems?

105
00:54:47,642 --> 00:54:53,891
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

106
00:54:55,392 --> 00:55:00,892
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

107
00:55:01,642 --> 00:55:04,891
who are doing harm, maybe.

108
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:08,767
That may be the wish of God.

109
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:11,892
But what is your wish?

110
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,891
Why don't you think that

111
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:21,642
"I have to be a person who is a store,

112
00:55:22,017 --> 00:55:27,017
who is a source of joy and love"?

113
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:33,142
I am not only talking, but I want you all

114
00:55:33,642 --> 00:55:35,767
to get your Self-realization.

115
00:55:36,392 --> 00:55:37,891
What is Self-realization

116
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:41,891
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

117
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,767
You don't know.

118
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:47,892
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

119
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:49,892
-- can you imagine?

120
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:52,142
You don't know what you are.

121
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,767
You don't know that you are the spirit,

122
00:55:57,017 --> 00:56:02,517
and that you are the source of knowledge,

123
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:04,767
of pure knowledge.

124
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,767
I find people sitting in a meeting,

125
00:56:08,267 --> 00:56:11,642
listening to some babaji

126
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:16,142
who is telling them some story, very happy.

127
00:56:16,891 --> 00:56:22,767
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

128
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:26,392
If you want to have reality and truth,

129
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:29,017
then please try to understand

130
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:31,892
that something has to happen

131
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:35,892
to you, some transformation has to take place.

132
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:38,891
You are not yet subtle enough,

133
00:56:39,392 --> 00:56:41,267
you haven't got those subtleties,

134
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:43,891
till you reach that point --

135
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,892
for which you don't have to leave your family,

136
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:51,142
you don't have to leave your children,

137
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:59,142
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

138
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,891
There's no need to do all that.

139
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:07,017
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

140
00:57:07,642 --> 00:57:10,517
and give all that belongs to you to me."

141
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:15,267
It's such a stupid idea.

142
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:19,891
These are emergencies today.

143
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:25,767
We are living in a very emergent conditions

144
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,642
-- try to understand.

145
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:30,142
And I want to warn you

146
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:33,017
that if you don't go deep into yourself

147
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,267
and find out what you are,

148
00:57:37,892 --> 00:57:41,392
and take to your transformation,

149
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,892
anything is possible.

150
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:48,267
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

151
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:53,142
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

152
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:57,392
all kinds of national problems are there,

153
00:57:57,892 --> 00:58:00,891
all kinds of international problems are there,

154
00:58:01,392 --> 00:58:04,267
that people can't help it.

155
00:58:05,517 --> 00:58:12,767
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

156
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:16,142
a personality of truth.

157
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:18,767
We don't know what is the truth is.

158
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:25,891
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

159
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:30,017
while our eyes are closed.

160
00:58:31,392 --> 00:58:34,892
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

161
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:38,642
but to make you alert and aware

162
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:42,392
that human beings have to change.

163
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:46,892
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

164
00:58:47,392 --> 00:58:51,017
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

165
00:58:51,517 --> 00:58:54,892
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

166
00:58:56,767 --> 00:59:01,642
But when I see the destiny,

167
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:05,017
I don't know how many will be ruined,

168
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,142
how many will be finished.

169
00:59:08,767 --> 00:59:10,642
What will happen to them?

170
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:13,267
What diseases they will get,

171
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:16,392
what problems they will get?

172
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:19,017
What will happen to their children,

173
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:22,392
what will happen to their country,

174
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:25,517
and what will happen to the whole world?

175
00:59:26,891 --> 00:59:29,767
Just widen your vision.

176
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:35,642
My vision is that all the people of the world

177
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,517
should get transformation.

178
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:43,767
We have enemies within ourselves,

179
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:48,267
and when they talk of jihad,

180
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:52,392
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

181
00:59:52,892 --> 00:59:54,892
What are these enemies?

182
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:59,892
These days, the worst is greed.

183
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:03,642
There is greed.

184
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:09,392
With that greed people can do anything they want to

185
01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:13,892
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

186
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:19,517
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

187
01:00:19,892 --> 01:00:24,767
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

188
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:28,017
that you don't even see what you have.

189
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:32,892
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

190
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:36,392
deceive your government,

191
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:40,267
deceive everyone and manage it.

192
01:00:45,891 --> 01:00:52,517
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

193
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:57,767
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

194
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:04,517
We develop anger for small things:

195
01:01:05,891 --> 01:01:09,892
like you have come to this country --

196
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:18,891
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

197
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:23,892
I can't understand.

198
01:01:24,642 --> 01:01:27,017
God has made different colors;

199
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:31,642
other we all would have looked same, like military,

200
01:01:32,517 --> 01:01:34,892
and life would have been miserable.

201
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:38,142
So the color has been created by nature.

202
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:44,017
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

203
01:01:45,517 --> 01:01:47,891
I just don't understand.

204
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:54,142
Because such a myth is going on.

205
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:58,267
With this myth we are fighting.

206
01:01:58,891 --> 01:02:02,017
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

207
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:05,017
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

208
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:14,392
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

209
01:02:16,517 --> 01:02:18,891
getting skin cancers.

210
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,517
I just don't understand.

211
01:02:21,892 --> 01:02:24,892
There's no logic, there's no balance

212
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:28,891
in us to see that what we are doing.

213
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:34,892
Why are we wasting this precious time,

214
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:38,142
when we have to get transformation?

215
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:42,392
This anger can be with anything;

216
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:47,891
anything one can develop anger.

217
01:02:48,392 --> 01:02:53,642
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

218
01:02:54,891 --> 01:02:58,267
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

219
01:02:58,891 --> 01:03:02,392
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

220
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,891
they could be aggressive.

221
01:03:05,267 --> 01:03:09,142
So they want to have this anger within them,

222
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:14,017
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

223
01:03:16,017 --> 01:03:18,142
This is the biggest problem:

224
01:03:18,767 --> 01:03:22,891
why do we want to dominate others,

225
01:03:23,392 --> 01:03:25,891
why do we want to oppress others,

226
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:29,642
and why do we want to take control of others?

227
01:03:30,017 --> 01:03:32,017
We can't control ourselves;

228
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,642
why are we wanting to control others?

229
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:38,017
What is the need?

230
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:44,392
Then, there are attachments:

231
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:50,267
attachments to their houses,

232
01:03:50,642 --> 01:03:55,642
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

233
01:03:56,142 --> 01:04:02,392
But tomorrow you won't be here.

234
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:06,892
You'll go with open hands.

235
01:04:07,517 --> 01:04:10,767
You can't carry anything with you.

236
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:17,267
So such attachment to things:

237
01:04:18,517 --> 01:04:21,517
they're very particular about their cars,

238
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,642
about their house, maintain it.

239
01:04:24,891 --> 01:04:29,891
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

240
01:04:31,017 --> 01:04:37,017
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

241
01:04:38,517 --> 01:04:40,892
Why are you wasting your energy

242
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:52,142
in getting angry with others?

243
01:04:57,517 --> 01:05:07,267
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

244
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:19,892
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

245
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:25,392
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

246
01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:28,891
or women having for men.

247
01:05:30,017 --> 01:05:33,642
To get attractive, for what?

248
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:37,267
Everybody has to get old.

249
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:44,267
What have you achieved by running after women,

250
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:48,891
running after other sex?

251
01:05:50,017 --> 01:05:54,891
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

252
01:05:55,392 --> 01:05:58,267
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

253
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:00,891
you are regarded wonderful person.

254
01:06:02,267 --> 01:06:03,891
This is not the way.

255
01:06:04,392 --> 01:06:07,891
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

256
01:06:08,392 --> 01:06:10,392
why are we doing this,

257
01:06:10,891 --> 01:06:13,891
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

258
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:23,767
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

259
01:06:24,017 --> 01:06:26,392
some of them are full-mad.

260
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:29,892
And what they tell Me, that

261
01:06:30,392 --> 01:06:32,767
they wanted to marry a particular woman

262
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:34,892
and a particular man or anything,

263
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:39,017
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

264
01:06:41,892 --> 01:06:43,892
That's not being very great.

265
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:50,392
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

266
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:55,517
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

267
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:59,267
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

268
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,392
You can be very strong,

269
01:07:02,891 --> 01:07:04,642
you can be very healthy

270
01:07:04,891 --> 01:07:06,892
and you can be absolutely balanced,

271
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:09,142
if you become the spirit.

272
01:07:10,642 --> 01:07:14,642
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

273
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:20,891
-- but have you reached that point?

274
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:25,642
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

275
01:07:25,892 --> 01:07:30,642
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

276
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:36,892
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

277
01:07:37,517 --> 01:07:39,892
Not yet. Not yet.

278
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:42,891
You have to know that;

279
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,767
because you are very great,

280
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:48,892
you are very precious,

281
01:07:49,517 --> 01:07:52,891
and you are so beautiful within.

282
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:56,267
But you are not aware of it.

283
01:07:57,392 --> 01:07:59,517
You have to become that.

284
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:03,892
That becoming is very important,

285
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:09,892
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

286
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:15,017
which is called as kundalini,

287
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,892
which can be awakened,

288
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:24,267
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

289
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:29,392
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

290
01:08:29,891 --> 01:08:34,017
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

291
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:35,892
And when it is free --

292
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:39,267
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

293
01:08:41,891 --> 01:08:44,891
-- when it is absolutely free,

294
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:48,892
why don't you take your Self-realization,

295
01:08:49,642 --> 01:08:52,517
and why don't you grow?

296
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:56,142
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

297
01:08:59,142 --> 01:09:02,642
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

298
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,142
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

299
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:12,142
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

300
01:09:13,767 --> 01:09:15,891
Are they speaking?

301
01:09:17,142 --> 01:09:19,392
Hindus know about it,

302
01:09:19,891 --> 01:09:22,892
that we have to get our Self-realization.

303
01:09:23,642 --> 01:09:27,891
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

304
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:37,767
All this kind of rituals

305
01:09:38,892 --> 01:09:41,892
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

306
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:44,517
what have we achieved? Nothing.

307
01:09:47,245 --> 01:09:50,642
So now, it's important for us to know

308
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:56,891
that we have to have our evolution,

309
01:09:58,517 --> 01:10:01,891
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

310
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:06,891
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

311
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:11,142
If we were self-realized people

312
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:14,142
there would have been no problem.

313
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:17,891
All kinds of selfishness,

314
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:24,017
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

315
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,517
all kinds of conditioning and ego

316
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:33,891
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

317
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:37,392
we have to get over it.

318
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:40,230
And once you get over it, you get united.

319
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,355
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

320
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:47,479
You lose all misidentifications.

321
01:10:50,228 --> 01:10:52,228
The time is running short.

322
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:54,978
I've been now here for the last,

323
01:10:55,353 --> 01:10:57,353
I don't know, twenty years or so.

324
01:10:57,978 --> 01:11:00,227
I worked very hard,

325
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:04,603
but what I find that people don't realize

326
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:06,978
what they are supposed to do.

327
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:16,228
They like people who will just say something very simple

328
01:11:16,978 --> 01:11:19,978
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

329
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:26,978
So the whole humanity has to understand

330
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:34,228
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

331
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:38,228
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

332
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:44,478
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

333
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:48,227
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

334
01:11:48,728 --> 01:11:51,103
don't have to work out anything.

335
01:11:52,478 --> 01:11:54,603
You take your Self-realization,

336
01:11:55,227 --> 01:12:00,603
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

337
01:12:03,103 --> 01:12:08,978
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

338
01:12:09,353 --> 01:12:13,227
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

339
01:12:13,603 --> 01:12:18,227
It's against God's wish,

340
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:22,228
it's against humanity

341
01:12:22,728 --> 01:12:26,353
and it will destroy all the human beings.

342
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:32,728
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

343
01:12:33,227 --> 01:12:36,603
and you have to know that we are all one.

344
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:42,227
We are all one, we are all global,

345
01:12:43,603 --> 01:12:47,478
we are not separated by color,

346
01:12:47,978 --> 01:12:52,227
race or religion, nation -- no.

347
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,227
We are all one,

348
01:12:55,353 --> 01:13:00,830
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

349
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:03,202
or by shouting,

350
01:13:03,227 --> 01:13:06,728
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

351
01:13:09,603 --> 01:13:12,228
It's not artificial.

352
01:13:12,728 --> 01:13:16,227
It has to be real, very real oneness,

353
01:13:16,603 --> 01:13:19,227
and that comes to you once you realize

354
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,478
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

355
01:13:24,853 --> 01:13:30,853
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

356
01:13:31,228 --> 01:13:35,353
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

357
01:13:38,478 --> 01:13:40,603
Why, why?

358
01:13:41,227 --> 01:13:44,353
Human beings have diverted themselves.

359
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:49,728
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

360
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:59,478
Because of complete greed of oneself:

361
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:06,853
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

362
01:14:07,228 --> 01:14:09,603
or your relation.

363
01:14:11,853 --> 01:14:14,145
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

364
01:14:14,311 --> 01:14:16,227
You are the spirit.

365
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:23,227
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

366
01:14:24,478 --> 01:14:27,103
is the ocean of love,

367
01:14:28,227 --> 01:14:31,103
is the ocean of all blessings.

368
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:35,228
So we have to decide.

369
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:38,478
Today I have to request you,

370
01:14:39,103 --> 01:14:41,853
that there's not so much time left.

371
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:47,228
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

372
01:14:47,853 --> 01:14:50,603
That's all the religions have taught.

373
01:14:51,103 --> 01:14:57,603
But how to do it was not so much explained,

374
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:01,103
and it didn't work out.

375
01:15:01,478 --> 01:15:05,353
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

376
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:07,978
Nobody listened to them.

377
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:11,478
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

378
01:15:12,978 --> 01:15:19,978
But now, please, all of you try to understand

379
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:22,728
the value of your life.

380
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,228
Why are you a human being?

381
01:15:26,603 --> 01:15:28,478
Why are you created?

382
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:31,103
What is the purpose behind it?

383
01:15:31,353 --> 01:15:35,978
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

384
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:47,203
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

385
01:15:47,228 --> 01:15:51,978
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

386
01:15:53,228 --> 01:15:56,603
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

387
01:15:58,603 --> 01:16:02,728
The problem is, you'll get your realization

388
01:16:03,103 --> 01:16:06,978
in the sense the power within you will rise.

389
01:16:07,353 --> 01:16:09,227
It's very well organized;

390
01:16:09,603 --> 01:16:12,728
actually, God is a great creator.

391
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:18,978
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

392
01:16:19,478 --> 01:16:22,227
Every individual He has done it.

393
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:27,728
With that happening, is not sufficient.

394
01:16:29,227 --> 01:16:32,227
You enter into, say, a palace

395
01:16:32,728 --> 01:16:36,228
and then you go round and see for yourself

396
01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:39,103
how beautiful you are,

397
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:42,853
what beautiful things God has made for you.

398
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:46,853
Then grow into it.

399
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:49,978
Once you have grown into it,

400
01:16:50,478 --> 01:16:55,853
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

401
01:16:57,103 --> 01:17:05,227
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

402
01:17:06,478 --> 01:17:08,227
There have been some

403
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:11,853
-- they have become just statues.

404
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:17,728
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

405
01:17:18,227 --> 01:17:19,853
how they were there.

406
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:30,886
So, tonight we can have the experience,

407
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:35,227
the experience of the spirit.

408
01:17:35,603 --> 01:17:39,353
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

409
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:41,728
It never used to happen like that.

410
01:17:42,227 --> 01:17:45,728
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

411
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:52,103
Please, be ready for that,

412
01:17:52,478 --> 01:17:56,603
accept it, take it, and become.

413
01:17:57,227 --> 01:17:59,228
Becoming is the point.

414
01:17:59,728 --> 01:18:02,228
What you become is the point.

415
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:08,978
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

416
01:18:09,478 --> 01:18:13,103
is your problem, not Mine.

417
01:18:14,353 --> 01:18:16,728
I can help you.

418
01:18:17,227 --> 01:18:19,227
I can work it out.

419
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:26,603
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

420
01:18:29,228 --> 01:18:31,227
It's much better,

421
01:18:31,728 --> 01:18:35,228
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

422
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:40,103
So it's better such people leave,

423
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:43,603
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

424
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,227
May God bless you all.

425
01:19:16,227 --> 01:19:18,853
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

426
01:19:21,728 --> 01:19:25,227
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

427
01:19:27,728 --> 01:19:32,603
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

428
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:38,103
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

429
01:19:39,728 --> 01:19:42,227
But how many will grow?

430
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:47,228
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

431
01:19:48,728 --> 01:19:52,853
then you have to practice it in the centers

432
01:19:53,353 --> 01:19:55,978
-- and it works out.

433
01:19:56,478 --> 01:20:00,353
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

434
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:04,603
and to this global problem.

435
01:20:06,227 --> 01:20:08,603
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

436
01:20:09,227 --> 01:20:13,227
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

437
01:20:13,853 --> 01:20:17,103
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

438
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:20,478
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

439
01:20:21,103 --> 01:20:26,603
But this dedication will make you so much

440
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:30,353
one with yourself,

441
01:20:30,978 --> 01:20:33,227
with the whole universe,

442
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:37,353
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

443
01:20:37,853 --> 01:20:40,853
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

444
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:47,227
So please don't stay here

445
01:20:47,478 --> 01:20:49,853
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

446
01:20:50,353 --> 01:20:52,228
Nothing will happen to you.

447
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:58,103
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

448
01:21:11,478 --> 01:21:17,228
What you have to do is not to do anything;

449
01:21:18,978 --> 01:21:21,603
to put just your hands towards Me.

450
01:21:23,603 --> 01:21:26,603
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

451
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:30,103
because Mother Earth is very important.

452
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:34,228
Please put both the hands towards Me.

453
01:21:48,228 --> 01:21:50,228
You don't have to pray,

454
01:21:50,728 --> 01:21:52,227
you don't have to say anything; just

455
01:21:52,728 --> 01:21:55,227
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

456
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:12,227
Now please close your eyes.

457
01:22:12,853 --> 01:22:17,978
It is important. Please close your eyes.

458
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:32,728
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

459
01:22:35,227 --> 01:22:39,227
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

460
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:48,728
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

461
01:22:49,228 --> 01:22:52,728
and ultimately pierces through

462
01:22:56,853 --> 01:22:59,728
the fontanel bone area

463
01:23:00,103 --> 01:23:02,478
which was a soft bone in your head,

464
01:23:03,227 --> 01:23:05,478
on top of your head.

465
01:23:10,478 --> 01:23:13,728
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

466
01:23:14,228 --> 01:23:17,227
It pierces through that,

467
01:23:18,978 --> 01:23:21,853
and enters into the subtle energy

468
01:23:23,853 --> 01:23:31,353
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

469
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:36,978
They call it by different name.

470
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:42,603
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

471
01:23:44,227 --> 01:23:47,603
Some call it as "ruh."

472
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:54,227
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

473
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:58,228
Once you get connected with you,

474
01:23:59,603 --> 01:24:03,603
when you start feeling on your fingers

475
01:24:05,853 --> 01:24:07,728
some sort of a breeze.

476
01:24:08,227 --> 01:24:11,227
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

477
01:24:12,728 --> 01:24:14,853
but then it cools down

478
01:24:15,227 --> 01:24:18,978
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

479
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:23,728
And it starts flowing.

480
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:29,228
You can now raise your left hand

481
01:24:29,728 --> 01:24:33,353
on top of your fontanel bone area.

482
01:24:33,978 --> 01:24:37,227
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

483
01:24:37,478 --> 01:24:41,978
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

484
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:53,853
You can move your hand.

485
01:24:57,103 --> 01:24:59,353
Now see with your right hand

486
01:25:00,227 --> 01:25:02,853
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

487
01:25:03,227 --> 01:25:06,353
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

488
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:09,728
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

489
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:11,728
See for yourself.

490
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:14,353
Bend your head; better is to bend.

491
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:16,978
Please bend your head.

492
01:25:18,728 --> 01:25:21,978
Again put your right hand towards Me

493
01:25:23,478 --> 01:25:29,228
and see for yourself with the left hand,

494
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:35,728
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

495
01:25:36,227 --> 01:25:39,228
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

496
01:25:39,728 --> 01:25:43,103
It is coming because of the heat within you.

497
01:25:59,603 --> 01:26:04,603
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

498
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,728
in their hands or on their fingers,

499
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:10,853
or out of the fontanel bone area

500
01:26:11,227 --> 01:26:13,227
-- this is the real baptism --

501
01:26:13,353 --> 01:26:16,227
please raise both your hands.

502
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:26,603
Just imagine:

503
01:26:27,227 --> 01:26:31,103
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

504
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,227
from its destruction.

505
01:26:34,728 --> 01:26:36,853
Try to understand your importance.

506
01:26:38,353 --> 01:26:40,853
You can put down your hand.

507
01:26:41,228 --> 01:26:45,227
Everyone practically has felt it.

508
01:26:45,728 --> 01:26:47,728
That means you are already matured

509
01:26:48,227 --> 01:26:50,103
to get your spiritual life.

510
01:26:50,353 --> 01:26:53,103
You are just on the brink of it.

511
01:26:53,603 --> 01:26:55,728
That's how you got it.

512
01:26:56,227 --> 01:27:01,228
It's last jump to reality.

513
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:06,227
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

514
01:27:07,227 --> 01:27:09,228
what is your spirit

515
01:27:10,228 --> 01:27:14,103
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

516
01:27:14,353 --> 01:27:16,478
what are spiritual powers.

517
01:27:16,978 --> 01:27:18,728
For this I would request you

518
01:27:19,227 --> 01:27:21,603
to first to come to the follow-up program,

519
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:26,853
and after that you can join any one of the centers

520
01:27:27,227 --> 01:27:30,353
which are closer to you and work it out.

521
01:27:30,978 --> 01:27:33,228
We have to work for the whole world.

522
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:37,228
You should know there are eighty-five countries

523
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,227
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

524
01:27:40,728 --> 01:27:45,978
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

525
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:49,227
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

526
01:27:49,603 --> 01:27:52,353
Only three years back I started there.

527
01:27:52,853 --> 01:27:57,227
And in England it's more than sixteen years

528
01:27:57,728 --> 01:28:02,228
I've been working here, and after that also:

529
01:28:02,728 --> 01:28:05,353
all the time, every year.

530
01:28:05,978 --> 01:28:07,478
But somehow

531
01:28:13,103 --> 01:28:17,853
their growth is very much there,

532
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:26,978
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

533
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:36,978
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

534
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:40,227
very much enjoy the reality.

535
01:28:40,603 --> 01:28:44,353
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

536
01:28:45,978 --> 01:28:47,853
May God bless you.

537
01:28:52,478 --> 01:28:54,228
They want to sing one song

538
01:28:54,978 --> 01:28:58,478
which was written in the twelfth century

539
01:28:58,978 --> 01:29:02,227
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

540
01:29:02,478 --> 01:29:05,103
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

541
01:29:06,228 --> 01:29:10,228
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

542
01:29:10,853 --> 01:29:13,353
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

543
01:29:14,103 --> 01:29:15,353
-- give me the union.

544
01:29:16,728 --> 01:29:21,228
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

545
01:29:21,853 --> 01:29:23,227
You don't have to do it.

546
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:26,227
Now you'll give up automatically.

547
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:30,603
The light that you'll have, itself,

548
01:29:30,978 --> 01:29:34,728
automatically you will give up, automatically.

549
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:36,978
You don't have to do anything.

550
01:29:37,228 --> 01:29:39,978
But you have to meditate.

551
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:44,227
About ten minutes, it's not much.
