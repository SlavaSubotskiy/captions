00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:09,087
Being Bandhamukta,  A free personality and Evening Program

2
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:14,074
Ganapatipule (India), 5 January 1988.

3
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:28,745
From yesterday's program

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:35,420
and all these days we must have realized

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:45,743
that to get your Kundalini working out,

6
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:53,576
to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara

7
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:59,981
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi it

8
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:08,197
is not necessary that you should sit for meditation for 3 to 5 hours.

9
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:12,075
Of course, you must meditate for a short time

10
00:01:12,276 --> 00:01:18,005
because that is at a point

11
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:24,054
where you are alone one with your God.

12
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:34,899
But otherwise in the collective when you merge into it

13
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,802
then the Kundalini rises the same way.

14
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:50,717
It's a very discrete way of understanding what happens.

15
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:55,189
In the collective when you are,

16
00:01:55,389 --> 00:02:00,276
you compensate each other, compliment each other

17
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:10,841
and the subtler side of the cosmos starts manifesting in you.

18
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,086
Then if you could really emerge

19
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:19,677
there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit language or in Marati language

20
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:24,405
is very good is 'ramamaana'.

21
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,812
I don't think merging with joy

22
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:36,510
but there is no 'with' you see, merging into joy.

23
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,701
So if you can merge into the joy

24
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:45,469
of anything that is Sahaj

25
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:53,946
you can become

26
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:59,813
a meditative personality.

27
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:10,375
You can achieve that meditative mood within yourself.

28
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:15,336
With that mood, with that force,

29
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:22,710
new subtler dimensions start breaking out within you.

30
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,504
Your different kind of conditionings,

31
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:34,306
which are like shackles binding you down,

32
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,760
just open out

33
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:42,490
and you become a free person - 'Bandhamukta'.

34
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,324
With that force everything breaks, your ego breaks,

35
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:58,120
your conditioning breaks and you become one with the

36
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,891
joy of life, divine life.

37
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:14,617
This you can experience

38
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:23,403
but to retain it within yourself

39
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:31,635
is only possible if you do your practices in Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:37,855
To control your attention,

41
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:42,934
to keep your attention to higher values,

42
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:47,197
to the higher things.

43
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,013
Let us see what are

44
00:04:53,213 --> 00:05:02,343
the low value system that we get into

45
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:07,686
which is regarded as something very important otherwise.

46
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:22,828
The first in the modern times is the consciousness of time.

47
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:27,596
What is the time now? What time we have to reach?

48
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:31,088
Oh God what is the time we are going to start it?

49
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,691
What time are we going to sleep?

50
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:37,335
Now we have experienced that yesterday we went home about

51
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,335
6 o'clock and slept at 6 if we slept at all.

52
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:46,126
You were quite tired till 2 o'clock I think

53
00:05:46,327 --> 00:05:50,870
then that gondhal business started

54
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:56,580
and you again relived the whole sequence

55
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,518
with a greater gusto I must say.

56
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,558
So at that time those people who try to keep dignity

57
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:09,565
and try to keep out of it

58
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:13,690
are still keeping down their conditionings.

59
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,064
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

60
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:23,771
for example, quite healthy, young can dance.

61
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:26,890
I mean old people need not do all that but they can

62
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:33,406
at least break through very well into the barriers of conditionings.

63
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:37,046
but such a person starts thinking "what's this going on" and

64
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:42,081
"oh, it is nonsense, how can I join this?"

65
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,478
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something not very decent,

66
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:53,551
decorous, like a waltz, but

67
00:06:53,996 --> 00:07:01,051
It's extremely natural and child like, innocent.

68
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:08,875
You can make out the people who are still in the barrier.

69
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:13,722
They even find it difficult to say "Jai Mataji!".

70
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:20,435
Such people are still bound down by the shackles

71
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,016
of the worldly life.

72
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:25,416
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, "What is the time?"

73
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:28,188
And again getting a headache. At such times,

74
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,603
you should never see the time. Because you will get a headache

75
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:33,793
if you see it.

76
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,825
Realizing it’s very late, you see,

77
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:41,763
and you say: "Oh God, it's 4 o'clock, we are still here."

78
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:49,651
So it is important for all of us not to have any watches

79
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,977
and even if we have, not to see them.

80
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:57,256
Or even you see them, they should be stopped.

81
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:01,885
So you go beyond time.

82
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:06,655
You go beyond time. You don't feel the time.

83
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:11,991
You don't feel the tiredness of time

84
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:17,801
and you just forget yourself,

85
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:22,715
which is tied down by time all the time.

86
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:33,176
Now then the second one is we talk so much.

87
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:36,779
"Oh we should have no religions, no jati (caste), no pati,"

88
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,303
like that we say, all of us, "you should have no caste system",

89
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:43,212
Indians especially: "Caste system is the curse."

90
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:46,473
People will talk like that and when it comes

91
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:50,769
to their own daughters' wedding they will not go beyond their caste.

92
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,503
"Caste system is bad." "Your religion is bad,

93
00:08:53,704 --> 00:08:55,920
this is bad, that bad",

94
00:08:56,121 --> 00:09:00,333
but when it comes to actual understanding of religion,

95
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,009
you can easily scratch them [beneath the surface] and find out

96
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,802
from where they come.

97
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:13,612
Worst of all the conditioning is, of so-called religions!

98
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:19,500
And this has to be broken completely

99
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,383
because they are all false.

100
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:28,103
Based on something solid. Supposing you have

101
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:33,374
a very solid foundation on that you put up a

102
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:38,255
house of, say, a pack of cards, as they say.

103
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:41,485
How long it is going to last?

104
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:44,261
If you go to the foundations you find all the foundations

105
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:49,104
are just the same but this pack of cards are different.

106
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:53,914
And they are the greatest delusions for human beings

107
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:57,335
which we are seeing every day, in every religion,

108
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,946
in every country, in every caste.

109
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:05,534
But still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

110
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:09,962
something historical or I don't know what.

111
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,986
We don't want to give up that.

112
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:23,302
That’s another very big binding force

113
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:27,830
to very low grade life.

114
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:32,621
I mean, say two caste people meet, same people,

115
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:37,025
how do they talk? “Oh so you are of the same caste?”

116
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,003
He says, “Yes I am.” “Then you must be knowing this man,”

117
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:44,015
“Yes, yes. He’s my father's brother's, this thing’s, this thing.”

118
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:48,719
In Marathi they will say “sakhaa”.

119
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:55,361
“Satyakla sakhaa”. “Manje kai?” (Marathi: “Means what?”),

120
00:10:56,623 --> 00:11:02,349
Like that: “Oh, so you are the cousin’s sister's,

121
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:07,070
this thing, that thing, real husband!”

122
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:15,449
And such terrible talks! I don't know, they go on for hours together.

123
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,410
And then I don't know what is the satisfaction out of it.

124
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,766
Then ultimately they did this, this - they,

125
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:28,615
they find out sometimes, or mostly,

126
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:35,130
that both of them are related to a dacoit (armed thief)

127
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,684
or to a thug or some sort of a bankrupt

128
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:45,337
or some sort of a horrible man and then they recede back.

129
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:50,140
Then they don't want to show any relationship.

130
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:54,075
So this kind of a nonsensical talks,

131
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:58,664
for example, if the ladies meet “oh,” they will say,

132
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:01,308
“where did you buy this Sari?” “I bought it there.”

133
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,227
“Oh, I went there. How much you paid?” She said, “This [much]”

134
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:08,575
Such waste of time goes on and on and on and on and on.

135
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,051
The whole life is wasted

136
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:16,635
in such a low-grade understanding of life's value.

137
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,361
Then they will also talk ill [of others], do this -

138
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:22,872
I mean you can build up on that all the filth.

139
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,570
It's something like the fungus growing.

140
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,004
From the dead, with little heat the fungus starts growing,

141
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:34,115
mutation takes place, and the fungus becomes aggressive,

142
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:36,627
can become cancerous, this, that.

143
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:42,668
In the same way all this low grade life starts.

144
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:56,024
Then this low grade life can extend in every walk of life,

145
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:59,603
like politics, economics, everywhere,

146
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:04,849
because it is like plastic.

147
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,766
Plastic can get into cloth, can get into trees,

148
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:12,126
can get into everything.

149
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,512
In the same way this horrible low-grade business

150
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:22,592
goes into these various things

151
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:25,377
and a person cannot rise

152
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:33,109
above this built-in plastic bondages we have.

153
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:40,230
At this time when we have such kind of programmes,

154
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,880
everything breaks off

155
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:53,474
and you really dissolve into the love of God.

156
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,153
There are so many other mundane things if you see how people talk,

157
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,353
how they joke and all that.

158
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:05,739
You will think it’s all filth going round you.

159
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:09,462
Slowly you will gradually recede from it.

160
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,676
That is how you prepare yourself

161
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:17,204
for retaining this joy within yourself.

162
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:23,559
Now we are coming to the fag-end of our tours

163
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,717
and when you will be going to your countries

164
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:31,900
you should see for yourself what's happening around

165
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,622
and just laugh and get out of it.

166
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:40,383
You have to remember those beautiful days of Ganapatipule

167
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,953
and you have to get into that mood

168
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:48,844
and know that you belong to the Kingdom of God.

169
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:53,943
I know we had very little time to talk

170
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,991
but music was even better. I could communicate better

171
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:59,191
through music to you.

172
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:02,380
 I’m working on you all the time

173
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,930
but still there are some people who are caught up.

174
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,628
I would request you, for all the leaders who find out

175
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:11,596
there are caught up people in their groups -

176
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,801
please don't call them for the pujas.

177
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:18,032
They should be kept back if you think they are not alright.

178
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,279
And they should not also feel bad

179
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,020
because they will be helped much
more if they don't come to the puja.

180
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,450
So tomorrow is going to be the great day for our puja.

181
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,990
I hope it will be convenient for all of you to come

182
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,755
and be seated here.

183
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:37,970
I think tomorrow, before coming to the puja don't talk too much

184
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,430
and don't discuss too much.

185
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,927
I think you must have had enough discussions today

186
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:49,284
and have reached some conclusions.

187
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:52,847
I would like to know if some questions were not answered.

188
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,520
If there is any I would like to answer them now

189
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,298
and after that we’ll start our programme. For about five minutes,

190
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:02,244
are sufficient for answering.

191
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:16,721
All questions were answered?

192
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:22,252
Is there any questions that was not answered?

193
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:29,392
Please stand up, I can't see
if there is anybody

194
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:41,042
Oh, ho, that's Sahaj.

195
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:46,432
Sahaj people have no questions. They have to only answer.
