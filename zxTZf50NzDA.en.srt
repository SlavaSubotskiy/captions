Advice to Sahaja Yogis
on Hygiene and other Topics

2
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:26,510
Alpe Motta, Italy
May 4, 1986

3
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:36,190
These are the songs they are sung in Himalayas,
and to be sung here is something really remarkable,

4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,190
isn’t it?

5
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,240
You brought it all the way to be sung here.

6
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:49,870
Now, I think I have already given you a very,
very long lecture and a speech as you call

7
00:01:49,870 --> 00:02:00,270
it, but some reactions were very good, and
some could absorb it very well.

8
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,579
But some, they said, were sleeping.

9
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,680
Now these things happen because of negativity.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,970
You have to fight your negativity, because
negativity is the thing that asks questions.

11
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,890
When I am talking I am telling the truth,
absolute truth, but it asks questions and

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,390
it reflects.

13
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,690
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes in
the head because you are left with the past

14
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,680
sentence, and the present you are not with
it.

15
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:39,010
So the whole thing boils down to something
like an escape, and then you escape and you

16
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,010
sleep off.

17
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,209
I mean, I tried My level best today to put
you onto your conscious mind.

18
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:51,340
You have to be conscious, you have to be alert;
and that’s the point, is that unless and

19
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,440
until you are conscious you cannot ascend.

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,760
Any abnormal person cannot ascend.

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,950
You have to normalize yourself.

22
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:09,900
So many of you had lots of abnormalities which
were brought out and thrown away, and many

23
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,269
have been cleansed, but now if there are some
still lingering with it, they must work it

24
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,269
out.

25
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,739
They cannot just go on justifying it.

26
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,400
Normally negative persons attract a negative
personality.

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,370
So if you have such a negativity of any kind
within you, you should never sit next to a

28
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,640
negative person, never go near such a person.

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,730
Keep away, but stick on to the positive person.

30
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:45,290
Like I said, stick on and support your leaders
without question, without questioning.

31
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,900
But this is the trouble is that you start
fighting your own leader.

32
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,769
If the leader says something to you, you quarrel
with the leader and you argue with the leader,

33
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,430
so it’s finished.

34
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,849
I speak through the leaders, so you don’t
question it.

35
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,760
If you question it, then there will be a problem.

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,030
You have to stick on with your leaders, who
are positive people.

37
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,599
And if you start questioning them, then you
will be nowhere – no link between you and

38
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:21,430
Me.

39
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,910
And this is everywhere: I was told in Switzerland
it is like this, in France now is better but

40
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,570
used to be like that; everywhere, except for
Italy – I think Italy has the best results.

41
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,979
So don’t fight with your leaders, don’t
argue them.

42
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,340
Do not reflect about Sahaja Yoga – what
can you say, what do you know, how can you

43
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,870
reflect?

44
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,740
What is your knowledge?

45
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,260
Do you question your chemistry teacher when
he says hydrogen has got two atoms or one

46
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
atom?

47
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,120
Do you?

48
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:09,390
And when you start doing this with your ego,
you are thrown out of the realm of evolution.

49
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,690
So do not reflect, just listen, and try to
take it inside.

50
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,530
These are all mantras; take them inside.

51
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,501
Instead of that you start questioning, arguing
with your leaders, giving them advices.

52
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:25,139
Please don’t do it – stop it now.

53
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:33,710
This is not politics, where everybody can
advise, everybody has to say something.

54
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:40,000
Mostly the bhoots are such; the bhootish people
go on advising and having their own say.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,110
And they go against the leader throughout.

56
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,310
Now specially for the elderly people, I would
say, because you are more grown up sometimes

57
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,940
than the leaders are.

58
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,650
Then you think you have a right to correct
your leaders – it’s not so.

59
00:05:52,650 --> 00:06:01,170
In Sahaja Yoga it is not how much you are
old, but it is how much you are evolved.

60
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:07,470
So when you start questioning your leaders
and reflecting on their behavior or anything

61
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:15,160
like that, and answering them back or also
giving your ideas, you are gone.

62
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,080
It’s like a link.

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:27,240
Say, there’s a link between the chakras
and the cells, say it like that.

64
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:37,370
Now if you deny the chakras, how one has to
work it out; because I am connected with them,

65
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,250
and through them you are connected.

66
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,780
But when you deny them, then you fall out.

67
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,229
I know what to do with the leaders, I choose
them, I arrange them, I organize them, I change

68
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,880
them; I know what to do.

69
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,639
Now you people do not challenge them – is
nothing but your ego.

70
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,630
In India it doesn’t happen at all, doesn’t
happen.

71
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,980
Once Mother has appointed somebody it’s
accepted, because for them this is the truth

72
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,419
that they have been seeking.

73
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,091
The all other is nonsense, is all complications;
and because you are so complicated, to you

74
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:18,530
other things look nice, you think you’re
surrendering your personalities – not at

75
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,889
all.

76
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,060
Is developing, surrendering yourself to the
sap of life, to the vitality, to the vital

77
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,680
force of life.

78
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Surrender, accept more, accept more.

79
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:38,820
This ego can never allow you to take inside
anything – be careful on that.

80
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:43,080
This will never allow you to sleep, this will
never give you peace.

81
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,090
It will never allow you to grow, it will never
take you to your own goal.

82
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,770
So surrender that your ego of yours.

83
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,229
So one thing I have to tell you: don’t fight,
don’t quarrel, don’t question, don’t

84
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:06,270
reflect about your leaders to begin with;
or otherwise you will be cut off.

85
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,160
Keep in his good book, try to support him.

86
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,330
Ask him what does he want, what help he needs.

87
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:19,742
The more you get attached to him, the more
you get closer to him, the more you will get.

88
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:26,039
But you see, people are very wasteful.

89
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,770
They have wasted their lives in drugs, this,
that, all nonsense.

90
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,300
And the women have another bad habit, is to
gossip.

91
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,610
They want to gossip: gossip about this person,
criticize that person.

92
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,199
It’s a very bad habit of women to gossip.

93
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:52,770
I never pay heed to anyone who gossips, and
I don’t like a person who gossips.

94
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,610
So don’t gossip about things – cheaply,
frivolously talking about others.

95
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,170
It’s not necessary you should be educated,
it’s not necessary that you should come

96
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,199
from a very well-bred family, nothing is necessary;
as long as you are a Sahaja yogi, you can

97
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,120
be a diamond.

98
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,650
But allow yourself to be cut into the diamond.

99
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,080
Allow!

100
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,940
So the reaction of some people was very good,
they absorbed what I said, they took everything

101
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,130
inside; but some of them went off to sleep.

102
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,670
Now, if those who were struggling at that
time may not have understood – it’s a

103
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,130
difficult subject, I told you, it’s a very
subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

104
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,591
But those who have been like that should look
after themselves, should find out.

105
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:49,360
I’ve found out one thing with the left-sided
people: if they can put a candle near their

106
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,210
left Swadisthana, a little far, and put one
candle before the photograph, and put left

107
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,930
hand towards the photograph and right hand
on the Mother Earth, it works.

108
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,220
And the candle at the back should be kept
a little far away because it makes sounds,

109
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,089
it goes this way, that way, burns.

110
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,860
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD
but other drugs, which are drowsy people who

111
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,970
feel sleepy, whose brains are destroyed by
drug, all those people can benefit a lot by

112
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,970
this.

113
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,790
Do it every day.

114
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,900
Going into drug you never felt you’re surrendered
to drugs, never felt that way – which was

115
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,770
something that was going to kill you completely.

116
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,980
You know how so many people are killed, so
many are dying, but you wanted to do that,

117
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,440
I don’t know, because your ego said, “All
right, go ahead, try this.

118
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,510
You will be the one who nothing will happen
to you.”

119
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,030
That’s the ego suggests.

120
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,030
So you did it.

121
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,530
All right, doesn’t matter.

122
00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:03,060
Whatever has happened has happened, let us
clear it out, because we are seekers.

123
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:12,860
So those who have really felt one in the lecture,
without any questioning, should know that

124
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,600
they are doing well.

125
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,480
Those who were questioning, reflecting, should
know they have ego, and those who were dozing

126
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,110
out should know that they are left-sided.

127
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,089
Left side is worse than the right side, because
the right side can be easily corrected: it

128
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,190
shows, it shows outside.

129
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,290
People don’t like it.

130
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,280
Such a person is criticized, everybody says
he’s egoistical, he’s this, that.

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,580
Everybody knows that such a person goes out
like Hitler.

132
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,010
But the left-sided person, you see, is very
pitiable and you’ll have very great pity

133
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,400
for such a person and you sympathize, and
you get lost with that person.

134
00:11:52,400 --> 00:12:00,950
They are more dangerous, and difficult to
be cured, very difficult.

135
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,060
So it’s not a easy task, you have to work
it out.

136
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,549
I am trying My level best.

137
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,620
You should also help Me.

138
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,079
I was thinking that if you can start using
a little oil for your head will be a good

139
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:16,079
idea, in the night.

140
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,490
As Sahaja yogis you should.

141
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,049
I think the hairstyle should be changed for
Sahaja yogis.

142
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,650
This modern fashionable style won’t suit
us.

143
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,480
Because this will, we’ll have all bald heads
one day, I can tell you, and you will see

144
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,120
the Sahasrara with a big dimple here.

145
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,930
Better use some nice coconut oil, rub in your
head nicely, and in the night and in the morning

146
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,820
– after all, it doesn’t show much – and
comb your hair in a proper way.

147
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,380
Because also I think, if your dresses are
like bhoots, your hair are like bhoots then

148
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,660
the bhoots will take over thinking, “Oh,
this is a bhoot sitting down here, I better

149
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,570
take hold of that bhoot.”

150
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:58,640
So dress up in a way – shouldn’t have
hair on your forehead at all, keep it straight,

151
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,000
make it nice, and have it absolutely clean
foreheads.

152
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,679
We are Sahaja yogis: we have to change our
dresses, we have to change our styles, we

153
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:14,160
cannot become fashionable like these stupid
punks.

154
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,130
So we are a type, by our hairstyle people
should know that these are Sahaja yogis.

155
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,850
So before you start getting bald, better try
putting some oil in your head.

156
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,319
That’s one very important thing the Sahaja
yogis have to do.

157
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:34,770
They can take vibrated oil if you like and
I think olive oil is good, but better than

158
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:42,110
olive oil, I find, it is coconut oil is better
for the growth of the hair.

159
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,699
But sometimes you can also put almond oil,
is also good, almond oil for you; because

160
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:56,189
if you have any problem that you feel exhausted
or your nerves need attention, you are nervous

161
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:59,620
type of person, then almond oil is good for
you.

162
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,640
And for people who have teeth which are troubling
them, they must look after them.

163
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,140
No use going to the dentist, because dentists
create problems.

164
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:18,870
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some
salt, and rub it on your gums nicely every

165
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,150
day before sleeping.

166
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,690
That will keep your teeth all right.

167
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,300
You’ll be amazed, till today I have not
been to any dentist.

168
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:34,150
Never been to a dentist, and I hope I won’t
go to a dentist.

169
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,880
So, but one thing is that I have certain bad
habits, one of them is that I brush my teeth

170
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
quite often.

171
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,770
But don’t use electrical brushes and all
that, but use brushes or use your fingers,

172
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:54,209
is the best way is to rub with the salt and
the oil, it’s very good for you.

173
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,610
And then allow the whole thing to come out,
and then wash off.

174
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:05,660
Then the third thing I find in Europe, that
you people do not clear your throats, and

175
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,830
your tongues, which is another thing very
much against Vishuddhi.

176
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,420
And that must be one of the reasons why your
Vishuddhis are bad.

177
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:20,559
So, though it is not in fashionable here in
the West, but very important thing is to put

178
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,880
your two fingers in the mouth and rub your
– fingers, not the thing, fingers – and

179
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,370
clean your tongue in such a way that everything
comes out in the morning.

180
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:36,000
Is important, because that accumulates and
then it rots.

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,510
So this has to be done.

182
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,809
And may be that you might think that this
is doing, you make a noise and all that, doesn’t

183
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,809
matter.

184
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,470
You have to clear out your throat; I mean,
that’s how you will keep your Vishuddhis

185
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,470
very clear.

186
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,130
This is one of the things.

187
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:56,059
And another thing is that you must always
use water as much as possible, for washing:

188
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,240
when you go for your morning ablution, water
must be used.

189
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,030
The paper is a very dirty and unhygienic habit,
very dirty and unhygienic habit.

190
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,150
But even if you use paper, you must use water
after that.

191
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:16,390
It’s very important that all the time the
water should be used as much as possible;

192
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,830
for Sahaja yogis it is a very, very important
thing.

193
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:32,480
Now for some people who will find that they
are on a subtler level quite on the verge

194
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,260
of collapse, in the way that they still have
those problems that they want to sleep with

195
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,329
other women and they want to do all these
things: they should give up Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,150
Best is to leave us alone.

197
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,809
We can’t have such useless people with us.

198
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:51,610
So they should give up Sahaja Yoga and don’t
trouble us; because we can get thousands and

199
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,120
thousands in India, we have no problem.

200
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,150
For them it is not difficult, they are already
there.

201
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,020
So those who are still like that, who are
trying to have relations with other women

202
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,431
and having their eyes on other women, and
all the women like that, you see, all this

203
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:14,260
kind of maniacs – I call them maniacs only
– should give up Sahaja Yoga and should

204
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,720
spare us.

205
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,079
This is for definite.

206
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,110
Now, we have always been saying that those
who are very negative people will have to

207
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,449
leave Sahaja Yoga, and the day will come.

208
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:29,110
So for all of you it is very necessary that
you should try to clean yourself, and never

209
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,990
sit with a person who is negative.

210
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,440
Never make friendship with a person who is
negative.

211
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
Try to be more helpful to a person who is
positive.

212
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:49,240
Clear out yourself, clean out yourself, look
after yourself, respect yourself, love yourself.

213
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,720
Live with your dignity.

214
00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:00,760
Cheapish thing, frivolous thing, useless thing
should not be done, and make your ego be challenged.

215
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,940
Let somebody insult you and see that, that
you do not answer back.

216
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,560
Just see it, not to get into temper.

217
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,480
Try that your ego doesn’t react.

218
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,780
That can be achieved very easily if you try
in the mirror, look at yourself and laugh

219
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,050
at yourself, make fun of yourself.

220
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,340
What do you think of yourself?

221
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,480
Who are you?

222
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
What do you have?

223
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,030
Nothing.

224
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:40,510
Now today’s lecture was really, was not
only was a great lecture, but also it was

225
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,150
like mantras, all good for the brain.

226
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,280
And I would say that this lecture must be
listened to again and again, and to be taken

227
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,030
in, not to be questioned.

228
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,910
Not to be questioned – to be taken in, to
be absorbed.

229
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,160
I hope that you understand this.

230
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:09,720
Now after this Sahasrara Puja I hope you people
try to maintain the position you have reached.

231
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:22,030
I would expect all of you to support, to glorify
your leaders and not in any way debase them,

232
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,020
argue with them, give them ideas.

233
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,100
Even the wives I have said are not to argue
with the leaders.

234
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,910
It’s like pulling each other.

235
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,910
Like they said there were some scorpions sent
for investigation from different places.

236
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,350
And they saw one jar was open, and they said,
“What is this?

237
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,800
This, from this jar all the scorpions will
jump out.”

238
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,840
They said, “They cannot, because one comes
up, the another pulls him down.”

239
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,670
In the same way we behave.

240
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:04,570
So if there’s a leader, this is ego that
makes you jealous, and this is ego that says

241
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:09,440
that you know better, you better give a suggestion.

242
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,740
Not that you cannot suggest – people tell
Me also things, but if he doesn’t accept,

243
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,750
well and good.

244
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,860
That’s a challenge to your ego.

245
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,190
It’s better that he says no to you so that
you see for yourself, “Is it my ego still

246
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,310
insisting on that position?”

247
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:32,850
Now, on the second thing that I have said,
that we should not be drawn by convention.

248
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:40,370
Like the convention was that, say now, this
time the English felt, the English leaders

249
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:48,130
felt – which was a big mistake – that
Italians would be inconvenienced if they stay

250
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,130
over.

251
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,380
Italians are very large-hearted people, like
Indians are, they’ll be overjoyed if they

252
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,380
stay over.

253
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,640
But it is the English mind.

254
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,110
It’s the English who cannot tolerate one
person staying for two days.

255
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,800
They’ll ask you immediately as you go, “What
time are you leaving?”

256
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,540
So it is their mind that worked out that way
that it will be inconvenience, because they’ll

257
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
be inconvenienced.

258
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,890
Though they were told “you could stay here
till Monday, there’s no problem, you have

259
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,310
to just pay just ten pounds”; but – “I
thought” – like that.

260
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:27,160
You see, it’s an English image of being
good to others; because to them anybody staying

261
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,360
in their house, finished!

262
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,450
They won’t even allow anybody to come inside
the house.

263
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,430
Let there be snow or anything outside, they’ll
just see and talk to you and then they’ll

264
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,430
say.

265
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:43,260
I’ve seen it Myself.

266
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:50,440
One day we had, I had gone out; it was snowing,
and I saw a lady standing out on a doorstep

267
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,700
with a pram, and there was a little baby.

268
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:03,290
And the other lady was an old lady talking
from inside, just from the chink, in a way

269
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,050
that the door was not completely opened out.

270
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,190
And when I came back after an hour or so,
still that lady was standing outside and talking.

271
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,720
This lady didn’t have sense to say that
“you come in.”

272
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:28,880
But this another lady did not mind it also,
because she must be doing the same!

273
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,350
So the large-heartedness of anything they
cannot understand.

274
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,580
Moreover there was no problem, it was suggested
that you can stay here and you can be here.

275
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,730
Now today we had to hurry up a lot, the whole
thing was quite inconvenienced and we had

276
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,940
to do it, because of a slight mistake that
they should have asked Me.

277
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,430
And I thought you all were staying on Monday,
because it’s logical, it’s sensible.

278
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,590
But because of the conception that “we should
not inconvenience” ….

279
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,010
It is not only with English, it is possible
with anyone of you.

280
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,520
When you start thinking “I thought,” you
are gone.

281
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,820
So these concepts that you have about things
are actually very dangerous things.

282
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:22,030
I’ve been having experiences of experiences
of these stupid conventions people have.

283
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,420
“I thought.”

284
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,520
They try to be good, but ultimately try to
be nasty.

285
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,030
They are nasty.

286
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,800
So that means there’s something definitely
wrong with the convention they have about

287
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,740
things.

288
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,090
And that’s why people, if they were right
when they were thinking, world would have

289
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,370
been a different thing.

290
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:56,480
But they are thinking at a level where it’s
just everything is sloping down, and you are

291
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
going downward.

292
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,950
As soon as you start thinking, you go downward.

293
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:08,160
Such is the defect of your thinking, because
it is bound by the tags of your conventions.

294
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,240
Wherever you think, you see, you are bound
by your conventions, and you go down.

295
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,210
I didn’t touch many points today which I
could have touched, like art, I was saying:

296
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,800
I was amazed, an exuberance like this, a flower
like this makes Me so very happy to see a

297
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
garden.

298
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,190
But to a sophisticated mind is Baroque or
something nonsensical.

299
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,100
To them one flower somewhere, because the
rest of the area should be their space for

300
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,830
their ego.

301
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:50,520
So they cannot see the beauty: “it’s too
much, too much.”

302
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,950
Even Sahaja Yoga: “there’s too much for
us.”

303
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,960
What are you, a little baby or what?

304
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,330
What is too much?

305
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,059
You see, as if like a baby we give a bottle,
so much of milk, so much of milk, so “Sahaja

306
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:05,870
Yoga is too much for me.”

307
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:11,050
You are dwarves or what?

308
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,670
And there’s no substance in this kind of
a nonsense.

309
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,200
That’s why “this is sophisticated,”
“this is nice,” criticize everyone.

310
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,100
People are so frightened even to decorate
their houses, because it will be criticized.

311
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,080
“Better keep it plain, white.

312
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,400
Just white.”

313
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,141
Even the nose they don’t like, they want
to cut out the nose, eyes, everything, just

314
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,350
have plain!

315
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:47,970
And imagine, it’s the play of the ego which
wants an individuality.

316
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:55,150
How they are in juxtaposition with what they
want to do – see this, clearly.

317
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,210
If you go in a garden they’ll have one,
you see, tree somewhere hanging in the air.

318
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,050
This is supposed to be garden.

319
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,110
You say, “Where is the garden”?

320
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,110
“This – garden.”

321
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,450
Microscope: “Where is the garden?”

322
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:16,550
“Oh no, we put only one thing at a point,
you see, so it becomes important.”

323
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:21,860
So this is only a tree here and then you move
up, there will be another little bush, then

324
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,350
another tree.

325
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,790
Everything is too much, why?

326
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,160
Because the ego is too much in the head.

327
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,470
That’s why everything is too much for them.

328
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,220
This stupidity has to go now.

329
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,340
You have to take whatever is good, too much
you must take, and give up whatever is too

330
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,550
much in you.

331
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,980
That has to be understood.

332
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:56,101
All these stupid ideas, all kinds of stupid
ideas – like you want to buy a house, so

333
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:58,490
it’s all right, you go and buy a house.

334
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:07,940
I went round, and most of the houses are about
seven-and-a-half feet height, but they like

335
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
it.

336
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
I said, “Why?”

337
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
“It’s very old.”

338
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
I said, “So what?”

339
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,000
“But it’s an old house, it is this and
that, and the old houses ...”

340
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,650
“But why do you like?”

341
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,990
New houses are eight feet, at the most.

342
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,360
So there’s no choice.

343
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,520
But why do you want to have a house which
is old house?

344
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,980
Victorian houses they don’t like.

345
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Why?

346
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,540
Because they are not so conventional, they
are not so fashionable.

347
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,670
You must have a house where you should break
your neck.

348
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:46,020
Walk into the bathroom in an awkward way,
you can’t even sit or stand; halfway you

349
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,540
hang in the air.

350
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,660
That’s the very house of a character.

351
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,720
And a character is that which makes you awkward
and feel funny: that person “has character.”

352
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,140
I mean, a person if he’s absurd, he’s
queer, weird, he’s strange, he’s a man

353
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,010
of character.

354
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,950
This is the situation today.

355
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,300
He’s a man of character and he’s weird,
absolutely a strange personality.

356
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,000
How is it?

357
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,340
“You know, he came on a bicycle with a half-pant.”

358
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
I said, “Really?”

359
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,040
“He’s a man of character.”

360
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,340
Here he is getting arthritis with it.

361
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,800
Being queer, funny stupid things is regarded
as something of personality.

362
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,600
Now as Sahaja yogis you have to realize that
you are not that stupid.

363
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,990
You are crowned with your Self.

364
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,640
Now you are not going to behave like these
stupid people and their fashions, so give

365
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,860
it up.

366
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,900
They laugh at you, you laugh at them!

367
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:03,703
In a lunatic asylum if you go, all the lunatics
will say, “Oh, so you have also come here

368
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:04,703
to join us, isn’t it?”

369
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:09,320
They all think they are the wisest, and you
get lost with them.

370
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,990
You start thinking, “Am I a lunatic myself?”

371
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,080
So you all, when you see such a person you
should just laugh at him.

372
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Like a lady, you see, she thought her to be
very fashionable, she came with her dress,

373
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,110
you see, very open, her body with all her
bones showing, and this and that.

374
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,420
And we happened to go to see that house, Myself
and My husband.

375
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,550
So as soon as he saw her, he came back and
vomited.

376
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
I said, “What’s the matter?’”

377
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,000
“I saw her – I vomited.”

378
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,940
And we got into the car, we didn’t enter
even, came away.

379
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,690
And she thought she was a very fashionable
lady, showing her bones, all her body – horrible.

380
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,451
Imagine, like a dead body standing before
you!

381
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:08,760
But the dead body is regarded as fashionable,
so everybody wants to behave like a dead body.

382
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:17,534
Now you should see the sense in it, otherwise
you are not Sahaja yogis.

383
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:25,600
You must see the nonsense that is going on,
and you are not a nonsensical personality.

384
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,520
So all these things now, if you see from a
new angle – as I’ve told you now that

385
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,240
you are higher personalities, that you have
achieved a new awareness of your chakras – you’ll

386
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,850
be amazed, your reactions will be very, very
different.

387
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,170
If you see something like this: “Ah!”
you’ll say, “beautiful!”

388
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:52,290
But till you have those horrible conventions
with you, you cannot.

389
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:57,980
A house which is dilapidated, absolutely going
to fall on your head, is “what a character!”

390
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,570
The whole character will fall on your head!

391
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:08,410
Absurd ideas people have.

392
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,450
And then they want something modern which
is absolutely weird and nonsensical.

393
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:20,320
You see, there was a lady, she built a house
– modern, and we had to climb up her steps,

394
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,460
and every steps she has divided into smaller,
smaller pieces.

395
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,330
We were so much worried that we’ll all fall
off.

396
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,170
You see, every step was made of small, small
pieces like a step, you see, every step was

397
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,809
made into steps.

398
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:38,260
So when you put your foot there you don’t
know where you are putting your foot, you

399
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
see.

400
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,680
And she must have spent a lot of money making
that kind of a nonsensical thing; but to her,

401
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,500
she would show everyone, “Now, come along,
see this.”

402
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,550
I refused to go up.

403
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,790
I said, “I have nothing to do.”

404
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,370
I went back.

405
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,470
Yes, yes, doesn’t matter.

406
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,470
As they show resentment, you must show resentment.

407
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,470
Stupid!

408
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:07,930
It doesn’t appeal to Me, it doesn’t appeal
to Me these things.

409
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,770
I have seen and I don’t like it these things,
the way there’s one flower hanging somewhere,

410
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,790
and anything if I see, I don’t like it.

411
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,679
I don’t enjoy it at all Myself.

412
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,110
And if I am the criteria, if I am the one
who can judge things, then I would tell you

413
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,590
I don’t like all this nonsense.

414
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,490
The way people dress up these days they look
like clowns to Me, lunatics, like I can say

415
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,240
brats, or you can call them – what do you
call them?

416
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
– tramps.

417
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,230
You cannot make out one from the another.

418
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:40,340
Their lousy pants, you see, some grandfather’s
pant they are wearing, and their grandmother’s

419
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,170
blouse on top, and the ladies walking on the
street.

420
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:51,690
See, is you feel there’s some funny, queer
people walking across – and they think it’s

421
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,690
fashionable!

422
00:32:52,690 --> 00:33:01,630
I think from India we should get all old clothes
here and sell them off for a high price!

423
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,850
It’s very queer.

424
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,190
You just look at it, see from this angle.

425
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,240
Standing on the hilltop you look at these
mad people, see how lunatic they are, stupid

426
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,690
they are, how they are behaving, what is their
fashion.

427
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:28,410
I mean, if you see in the olden times people
used to dress up well with all kinds of frills,

428
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:35,300
all kinds of things, but this is what they
don’t like.

429
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,190
Whatever is God has given us should be decorated
and respected.

430
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:46,470
I mean, yesterday the way you did the hall,
I mean today the way you did the whole of

431
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:52,600
the hall and all that, so beautiful it looked,
so nice it looked.

432
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,210
But somebody would say, “Oh, let us have
absolutely plain thing for Mother: some dilapidated

433
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,000
wall behind, which is about to fall down.

434
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,470
That would be real character.”

435
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,270
How can these ideas be acceptable to Sahaja
yogis?

436
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,399
This I just don’t understand.

437
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:20,530
And they pay for it.

438
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,700
They pay for these conventions and they pay
for all these kinds of odd things, they do

439
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,000
pay for it.

440
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,919
Supposing there’s a fashion today to have
your hair cut like this on top, they’ll

441
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,050
pay for it.

442
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:38,230
Then you cut them another way, they pay for
it.

443
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,649
You have to pay for all these misdoings also.

444
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:47,450
The fashion is: supposing somebody invites
somebody to your house, you must have a different

445
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:55,530
type of a glass cup and a glass for this,
otherwise you are not all right.

446
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,980
And then what you find, there’s another
group of these hippies and all those have

447
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,600
come, they will give you the dirtiest possible
mugs that you cannot drink anything.

448
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,100
So either you accept this nonsense or that
nonsense.

449
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,590
It’s absolutely absurd!

450
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:19,860
And you know, I have seen Indians when they
are in England, they just don’t understand,

451
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:26,550
they just “Cancel them, all right, cancel
them.

452
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,670
They’re mad people.”

453
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:40,990
The quality of personality is very, very low,
very low, take it from Me – very low.

454
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:51,400
You might have ego, might exist with that
ego, but it’s very low here, accept it.

455
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,790
Innocence is missing, auspiciousness is missing,
cleanliness is missing.

456
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:06,630
The, the attraction of simplicity is missing
– so artificial.

457
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,190
Even the idea of simplicity is artificial.

458
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:17,540
With artificiality how can you have a quality
of human life?

459
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,580
How can you?

460
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,590
You become artificial people.

461
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:28,020
So give up all these conventions.

462
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,980
I am not here to propagate Indian culture
as such, but I must say if there is any culture

463
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,930
it is in India, because this is no culture.

464
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:44,680
All becoming – if you walk about, I mean
you look like, when I see the people around,

465
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,760
they look like host of mad people walking.

466
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,000
You see them on the streets, not one person
is normal.

467
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,670
America is even worse.

468
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:02,940
They must be doing like this, or this like
this; not one person has a proper face.

469
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,710
Is a fact, I tell you!

470
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,440
With Sahaja Yoga your quality has come up,
it has come up.

471
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:22,310
You’ve become that now, so great.

472
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:28,390
That’s why you do not feel here there is
lakshmi.

473
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,120
You have money, but no lakshmi.

474
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,370
There’s no beauty of that.

475
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:45,370
It’s so desolate, like a barren land.

476
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:52,320
Your ego has blown off everything that was
beautiful.

477
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,480
You could not tolerate anybody’s art, so
you would not have anything artistic things

478
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
in the house.

479
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:07,630
You need not have many things at all, so you
have plastics.

480
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,150
Beauty has run away from your lives.

481
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,810
When you talk also it’s fashionable to be
arrogant.

482
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:26,780
Imagine – to be arrogant, to be very dry:
there’s no beauty in it.

483
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:41,830
Is all put-up show; there’s no bravery in
it, nothing sublime.

484
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,580
On the subtle form you have lost it, that’s
why in the gross form you don’t see it.

485
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:57,780
Whatever you have lost inside is shown outside
– bankruptcy, complete bankruptcy.

486
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,080
So when you see that with others – when
I am saying “you” I am meaning the others,

487
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,500
those who are not yet Sahaja yogis in the
West – try to understand they are at a much

488
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,260
lower level than you are, and don’t take
to their ideas and their ways and methods.

489
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,760
Just keep yourself aloof.

490
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
And then you will see they’ll run after
you.

491
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:25,820
Ego is like a donkey: if somebody is ahead
of them, they know somebody is ahead of them,

492
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,310
then they bend their head to that.

493
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:37,290
And if they see somebody is behind them, then
they kick.

494
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,540
So you have your dignity, you have your special
style, you live with a special style.

495
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,930
Don’t be one of them.

496
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,990
Dress up properly in a proper way.

497
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:54,619
You may have only two shirts, you may have
only three shirts, you need not have many;

498
00:39:54,619 --> 00:40:11,470
but have in something sensible, normal, comfortable,
and also which is not jarring to others.

499
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,990
We are the ones who are going to encourage
our art, we are the ones who are going to

500
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,290
bring back all that is lost.

501
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,490
We can’t have Rembrandt anymore, we cannot
have Leonardo da Vinci, we cannot have Michelangelo

502
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,750
again – finished them all completely.

503
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,490
But everybody thinks they are Michelangelo!

504
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:51,410
We can’t even have, say, Gorky; we can’t
have William Blake, can we – of that courage?

505
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:58,200
We cannot have Abraham Lincoln, can we have?

506
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:05,160
All dwarfs, useless people.

507
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,740
You scratch them and you find they are good
for nothing, useless.

508
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,810
Out of you all these great people have to
come out now.

509
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,820
And their speciality about them, they had
their own personality, and they would not

510
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,280
give way to any fashions or anything.

511
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,440
They wouldn’t give way to any cheap popularity.

512
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:35,130
Out of you people all these great personalities
are to be born.

513
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:42,030
So for you and for your progeny you have to
think, what are we doing in such a great work

514
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,030
as it is.

515
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,911
It’s not only for your enjoyment that we
have a seminar, nice music, nice food, nice

516
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:51,910
place, we come, we enjoy – no.

517
00:41:51,910 --> 00:42:04,230
Enjoyment is just an advertising department.

518
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:13,220
You have to really work hard inside, not outside.

519
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:20,250
No arguments of any kind.

520
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,640
Useless!

521
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,609
Simple thing, if I say I have to carry, say,
this box, somebody will come out and start

522
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:32,310
saying, “All right, then I think we should
get a van.”

523
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,990
“No, but a van is too much.”

524
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,460
“Then what should we do?”

525
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,690
They’ll go on arguing till that the box
is gone, everything is done, and I come back

526
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,849
and say, “Now, what are you doing?”

527
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:45,460
They are still discussing how to take the
box – it’s already gone!

528
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:58,849
Such wasteful habits we should give up.

529
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:02,090
We have to have new wisdom within us.

530
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,500
All this old wisdom, you just throw it away.

531
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,780
Unless and until you do that, your ego won’t
go away.

532
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,590
It won’t leave you, unless and until you
decide to throw away all those ideas which

533
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:22,770
to you appear to be the ego.

534
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:30,950
You have to be like children, trying to learn
something new all the time; we are to be open

535
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,550
to learn something new all the time.

536
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,400
You have to learn – you have lost it.

537
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,920
You had something that you have lost, so many.

538
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,849
Instead of going ahead, you have lost it.

539
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:48,200
You were doing all right; if you had remained
on the right path you would have achieved,

540
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,280
because after all, some countries are traditionally
very old.

541
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,280
They also got lost – like Greece, you can
say is lost.

542
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,790
Horrible Greek tragedies: I mean, you sit
down and cry for nothing at all.

543
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,880
Nothing has happened, everything is perfect;
people just go and sit down and cry.

544
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,430
It’s like you make somebody say that “This
one is dead.

545
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,020
Let us now feel that he’s dead.

546
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,119
Sit down, all of us should cry.”

547
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,290
Stupid as that!

548
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:24,480
It’s all artificially-created problems and
artificially-created gloom, because you have

549
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,690
no real gloom, you have no real problem.

550
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:33,000
You have got food to eat, you’ve got everything
– that’s why you are creating problems

551
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,369
for yourself.

552
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:39,859
That’s why you need psychiatrists, you need
drugs, you need this, you need that; because

553
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:45,130
you have no problems, so you want to have
some problems – as simple as that.

554
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,040
Those who have problem have to fight with
it.

555
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,190
They have no time for all these nonsensical
things.

556
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,190
You have too much time.

557
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,150
All your problems are solved as far as the
material things are concerned, but still you

558
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,350
are very much involved into it.

559
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:10,920
So now face it, face it clearly, that we are
not that any more.

560
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,410
We are different people.

561
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:20,680
We are no more worms in the mud but we are
lotuses, we have fragrance, we have powers,

562
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,470
we are specially blessed.

563
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,310
We have a special sense of joy.

564
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:40,930
Let’s enjoy that and give it to others and
be glorified with it, feel the dignity of

565
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:43,230
it.

566
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,520
I’m sure it is going to work out this time.

567
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:55,950
I have done My level best, I think, and this
lecture should really go through you all.

568
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,860
All right, any questions?

569
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,180
(Please have some water.)

570
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,109
Any questions you have?

571
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:11,349
(Water.)

572
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:19,750
They might be thinking that I’ll drink from
here!

573
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,690
Modern idea maybe that I drink from here!

574
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:30,869
So there’s no need to have glass, Mother
may like to drink from there!

575
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:48,849
All right, any questions?

576
00:46:48,849 --> 00:47:02,340
In thoughtless awareness.

577
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,150
Now keep it up, keep it up in thoughtless
awareness – absolutely you’re blasted.

578
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,099
Keep it up.

579
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:12,060
Keep yourself blasted.

580
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,260
That is this ego business.

581
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,070
Little bit is still there, rudimentary: keep
it out.

582
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:30,200
This is meditation, where there’s no ego
any more, you are in thoughtless awareness,

583
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,190
absolutely stunned.

584
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,190
Can’t think.

585
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,750
But that I have done, is not good – you
should do it.

586
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,670
That is the point I am commenting on.

587
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,050
Have your own personality.

588
00:47:45,050 --> 00:48:07,780
If punks could behave like that, why can’t
you behave sensibly?

589
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:19,841
And also I have to say few words about how
we behave in our day-to-day life; because

590
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:25,170
a Mother has to see that they are, children
are not to be ill-bred.

591
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,410
People should not say that Sahaja yogis are
ill-bred, you see.

592
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:36,400
Now the first sign of an ill-bred child is
that he leaves his bed in a mess.

593
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,220
He leaves all his things in a mess.

594
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,270
While coming I saw all the beds.

595
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:50,880
What are we doing here?

596
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,010
Nothing.

597
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:58,890
So put yourself into a discipline of leading
a neat life.

598
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,349
As a Mother I have to tell you this.

599
00:49:02,349 --> 00:49:08,720
It takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes, but
just tell yourself this is meditation, do

600
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
in meditative way.

601
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,280
We in India think that the Western people
are extremely neat and tidy.

602
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,090
Really!

603
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,090
They can’t believe it.

604
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:24,800
They think you are on top of the world, you
must be the neatest people ever lived.

605
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:34,610
They’ll say ten times “thank you”, but
even once you will not keep your bed all right.

606
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,210
Your things should be neat.

607
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:46,670
You must keep yourself neat, appear neatly.

608
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:51,270
Then second thing I have seen, noticed this,
which is told by many people which I have

609
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,390
also noticed, that you go to somebody’s
house.

610
00:49:54,390 --> 00:50:00,980
Then an ill-bred person will start using the
phone without asking.

611
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:07,440
Certain things are important to understand,
like entering into the kitchen, eating everything.

612
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:18,200
It’s a very common thing people are noticing
this, that you get the food – like paupers,

613
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,220
like beggars they come in the house.

614
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:30,340
I had at least twenty-one bottles of honey
which people had given Me as present, and

615
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,820
when My son-in-law came there was not even
one bottle to give him honey.

616
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,820
So who ate?

617
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,210
All the Sahaja yogis who came ate the honey.

618
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:47,089
I mean, it’s all right, but you must ask.

619
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,530
You polish off everything in the house.

620
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:53,710
All right, you have come, if there is a food
cooked for you, just have your food.

621
00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:03,960
If you 
go in the larder or you go anywhere, you find

622
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,610
everything is missing.

623
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:13,200
You buy from the whole mart, you find everything’s
polished off.

624
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,359
So an ill-bred person can be made out like
that.

625
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:24,790
But you’ll be surprised, a good-breeding
person, even if this much is left of another

626
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:30,810
person, that person will keep it and keep
it till it is passed over.

627
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,890
I’ll tell you about My own husband who is
– he need not worry about this thing, but

628
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:41,410
if he knows we have something of another person,
he’ll put it in lock and key and see every

629
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:49,150
time it is there, till he returns it to him.

630
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:57,980
And same I can say about My children, or anybody
I know of.

631
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:03,510
But this is beggarish that you take somebody’s
things, misuse it, throw away where you feel

632
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:05,330
like, break everything.

633
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:12,890
But I have seen with My own things; so when
the leaders have been complaining to Me that

634
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,560
“they come to our houses, they polish off
everything from our fridges” and all that,

635
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,340
I was not surprised.

636
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:28,839
The Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort for
all the beggars and the paupers of the world,

637
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:29,839
because it is free.

638
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:37,349
All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga,
and you have to nourish them and look after

639
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:38,349
them.

640
00:52:38,349 --> 00:52:40,119
It should not be such.

641
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:47,920
You may be poor, but you must have dignity.

642
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,580
Even the servants are in India better.

643
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:56,100
They wouldn’t touch your things without
asking.

644
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:02,660
They have much more breeding.

645
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:12,400
An ill-bred person is a person who is a rude
person, arrogant person.

646
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,010
You can say the same thing in a proper manner.

647
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:24,890
As a Mother, to give Me real glory is that,
that people should say that you are very well-brought-up

648
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:27,800
children.

649
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:43,540
A kind of system must exist.

650
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,020
A spartan system.

651
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,070
It’s a spartan system.

652
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:53,130
It’s not all a sort of a lousy system, it’s
a spartan system.

653
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,010
You are yogis.

654
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:03,750
Should be neat, tidy, all the time clean,
with few things.

655
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:10,240
Like in India, people are quite shocked: you
carry such big, big bags, and it carries all

656
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,761
the – for ladies specially – all the paints
and this and that.

657
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:20,020
Where are you going to use before the villagers
there, these paints?

658
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,690
They don’t understand.

659
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,130
All these things we have to see for ourselves.

660
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:39,020
We have to be dignified, we have to be people
with a kind of a personality.

661
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,280
Supposing somebody is a saint.

662
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:48,220
He might be a poor man, but you can make him
out by his dignity.

663
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:53,970
There was a saint called Tukarama whom, which
you have heard about him – this all may

664
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:59,290
be, I don’t know, was coming from his music.

665
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,760
He was poor and very generous also.

666
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,210
He used to give away everything, and always
left with very little.

667
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:17,800
So Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji came
down to his place, brought lots of ornaments

668
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,230
and things and presentations, and gave it
to his wife and children.

669
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,770
He was out.

670
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,720
She was very happy to wear all these things
because he gave.

671
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,200
He said, “This is ...” Of course, in the
beginning she also said that it’s not all

672
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
right.

673
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,420
But he said, “No, I am just trying to sort
of pay my respects to you, this, that, and

674
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,420
give.”

675
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,420
And she wore it.

676
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,420
He came.

677
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,450
He said, “No, I am a saint.

678
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,450
You take this.

679
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,620
You are a king, and you have to live like
a king.

680
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:56,310
All right, as a king you can have it.

681
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:01,109
But not – as a saint I don’t need all
these things, my wife doesn’t need all these

682
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:02,109
things.

683
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:07,810
Because you are living like a king, you – maybe
you are a realized soul also, but you are

684
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:14,290
a king, so live like a king.”

685
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:21,990
But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga
you are not to move like a barren personality

686
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,990
also.

687
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,530
You have to be properly dressed, properly
appearing.

688
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:36,300
You should not look like beggars, but you
should look like dignified people of the society.

689
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:42,440
Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess,
and the Goddess has to wear I don’t know

690
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,380
how many ornaments just to adorn Her chakras.

691
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,530
I mean, I have lots of ornaments Myself of
My own.

692
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:59,940
But only for puja I wear, otherwise I don’t
wear: I am supposed to wear lots of things.

693
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:00,940
Why?

694
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:07,440
Because it may not be that – all right,
may be dignified, but may not be that all

695
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,140
right to wear all those things all the time.

696
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,440
But I am supposed to wear.

697
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:20,700
Like You are supposed to wear many more things
in the hand here, rings on the feet, everything.

698
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:28,730
All the time You have wear gold in the – what
do you call the – you don’t have that

699
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,460
ornament here which we tie up like a belt.

700
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,720
But I don’t do it.

701
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,190
I keep it to a marginal point; only in puja
I wear some things out of it.

702
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:55,480
So you must have that discretion: what to
wear, how to wear, how far to go, how to look

703
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:06,900
dignified, how to be well-bred, so that you
glorify the breeding of your Mother.

704
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:16,340
This time I hope when you all come to India,
you will notice all these things among Indians.

705
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:22,940
You will never see them eating, you’ll never
see them having their baths, you will never

706
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,300
see them sleeping.

707
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,640
You don’t know how they live, where they
live, how they work out, everything.

708
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,010
They are just there on the spot whenever you
are there.

709
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,170
Isn’t it true?

710
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:41,590
They take their baths, they finish everything,
early in the morning, about four o’clock

711
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:47,120
or five o’clock they are out – spartan.

712
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:54,450
And always clean: whether he’s a villager,
whether he is a scheduled caste or a brahmin

713
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:59,940
or anything, they’re all neatly dressed,
you cannot make them out.

714
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:08,050
Clean white clothes they’ll wear, clean
white cap they will have.

715
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:18,589
They’ll never have dirty clothes.

716
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:27,579
So this is another side, which is not so sublime
on your side and not so subtle and, but it’s

717
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:40,310
very important; because whatever is in the
subtle expresses outside.

718
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:51,490
In all your behavior this would shine, like
thousand facets of a diamond, because you

719
00:59:51,490 --> 01:00:00,830
have attended now the Sahasrara Day – let’s
see; what are the thousand facets will show.

720
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:13,640
Love each other, respect each other, respect
yourself, and all the time say one mantra

721
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,260
within yourself, “I am a Sahaja yogi.”

722
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:21,859
It says everything about your responsibilities,
what are your aspirations, what you are.

723
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:34,290
You 
are a Sahaja yogi, being reborn by Adi Shakti

724
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:46,110
Herself.

725
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,700
Any personal problems you have you should
write to Me, and I’ll try to answer.

726
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:55,359
If I do not answer, then think that answer
I have managed.

727
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:59,150
If I do not answer, then think that I have
managed the answer; but if there’s anything

728
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,380
to be suggested I will definitely inform you.

729
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,590
Any other problem.

730
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:10,329
But like a lady today came, she was crying
about her husband.

731
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:14,820
This she did before also, again today she
is crying – she’ll go mad.

732
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:18,800
A Sahaja yogi should not cry.

733
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,999
Overcome your problem, try to handle your
husband, try to handle everything.

734
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:28,880
I do not very much like the divorce part of
it, but if somebody’s a gone case is all

735
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,880
right.

736
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,480
If I say it’s a gone case, you divorce.

737
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:39,670
But unnecessarily, just because there’s
not yet proper understanding, one should not

738
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:41,470
cry, weep and do all these things.

739
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:52,820
On the contrary, one should try to overcome
your own personal problems, because you have

740
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:58,810
powers.

741
01:01:58,810 --> 01:01:59,980
And You can write to Me.

742
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,590
Not very long letters, but I get lost!

743
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:16,339
Ha, really, I get lost!

744
01:02:16,339 --> 01:02:23,630
In the morning there are so many letters for
Me to read, one better than the other, and

745
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:29,320
My husband also get a big post.

746
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:36,099
But he says, “Nobody writes me love letters,
they all write about their bills to be paid.”

747
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:53,839
I said, “It’s just the same!”

748
01:02:53,839 --> 01:03:04,349
(You may translate this, Gregoire, if they
want.)

749
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:39,430
Letters … full of 
problems …

750
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:44,300
I said, “I have to pay for their love.”

751
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,839
That’s what it is.

752
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:55,650
But children write very sweet letters.

753
01:03:55,650 --> 01:04:01,550
They just make some painting or something,
or some flowers and few things there, that’s

754
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,550
all.

755
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:08,200
They’ll make the heart and put Me there,
or something like that; very sweet, sweet

756
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,740
things they do.

757
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:16,890
And just the joy and happiness, you see, they
express it.

758
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:20,060
Never their problems – they have no problems,
children don’t have, they are not complicated.

759
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,930
We catch hold of the problems, that’s the
trouble is.

760
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:30,310
They have no problems of any kind.

761
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:35,380
So you have not told Me, any one of you, anything
that you want Me to be done.

762
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,880
Now only thing, at the last I would like you
to listen to Warren who will read it out to

763
01:04:40,880 --> 01:05:05,079
you, the programs we are going to have in
this summer-time.

764
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:06,750
Come forward.

765
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,930
…. Yes, now.

766
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:20,440
…. No, no, no, then I go to Houston.

767
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,520
…. Yes.

768
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,250
And then visiting London, that’s all.

769
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,250
…. Yes.

770
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,210
…. Twenty-seventh I think, I go.

771
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:28,210
Yes, twenty-seventh.

772
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,210
….

773
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,140
That’s not definite, but we’ll see.

774
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,619
In the evening.

775
01:05:32,619 --> 01:05:33,619
…. Puja.

776
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:36,589
That’s the puja for Belgium and Holland.

777
01:05:36,589 --> 01:05:42,210
…. No, better to have puja at a place where
we have the Monday program.

778
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,410
In Belgium.

779
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,810
No, just after that.

780
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,810
About fourteenth I come back?

781
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,339
So that is what, a Saturday or a Sunday?

782
01:05:51,339 --> 01:05:52,339
…. Spanish people are here still?

783
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:53,339
Or they are gone?

784
01:05:53,339 --> 01:05:55,600
…. So, they would like Me to be there for
a weekend, or for the weekdays?

785
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,540
That’s the point to be decided.

786
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:03,869
…. One day …. So, what is – Spanish
people, are they more available on weekends

787
01:06:03,869 --> 01:06:04,869
or weekdays?

788
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:05,869
Weekdays, weekdays.

789
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:08,930
So I can fly on, say, Tuesday.

790
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:20,650
On Monday I can fly, and Tuesday we can have
a program: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday – three

791
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:23,230
days, all right?

792
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,230
Yes.

793
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:37,950
And then I can – we have to have a puja,
so on Friday.

794
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:47,140
Or I go on Monday would be better: Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

795
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,690
And Friday I can go to ….

796
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:58,100
I can come Sunday evening, and Monday morning
you’ll have the puja, it’s better.

797
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:06,290
And we have programs after the puja; it’s
much better to have programs afterwards.

798
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:10,300
Then My vibrations are also released.

799
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,309
So Monday morning we’ll have puja.

800
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:26,290
…. Have you given them the saris and things
like that?

801
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,390
No, no.

802
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:29,040
No, no, no.

803
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,349
Sunday I’m coming back.

804
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,349
No.

805
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:35,250
Then next Sunday is what?

806
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:39,849
What is the following Sunday?

807
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:41,290
Ah, twenty-first.

808
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,290
Monday.

809
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:44,160
Puja, morning Monday.

810
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:51,270
Or you can have it Sunday night if you like,
puja, which will suit better – Sunday night.

811
01:07:51,270 --> 01:08:00,150
For puja, Sunday night would be better.

812
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,690
So Sunday morning I’ll go.

813
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,230
Twenty-first Sunday morning I come, all right?

814
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,230
All right.

815
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,000
Then Sunday we have puja, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday I could be there.

816
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:17,779
Thursday I’ll go to Montpellier, and I can
return from there to London.

817
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:18,950
How many days?

818
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,520
Three days are sufficient?

819
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,520
Three.

820
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,520
…. Keep it four now.

821
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:27,830
So I’ll reach there on Sunday; Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday – it’s all right, four days.

822
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,000
Thursday morning I’ll go to Montpellier.

823
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:44,569
Thursday evening we’ll have program there,
and then … Is there a direct flight?

824
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:52,960
…. But is there a flight from there to London?

825
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,350
It’s a rather out-of-the-way thing.

826
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,350
Is there?

827
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:00,659
So why not do Montpellier first, and then
go to Spain?

828
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:07,080
But from Montpellier to Spain, is there a
flight or not?

829
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,579
That you find out first of all.

830
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:22,559
But you keep it that time, about that time;
definite we’ll let you know, once we have

831
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:34,410
done with the Montpellier.

832
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:36,390
…. No flight?

833
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:43,719
…. But in any case you keep this program
with them.

834
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:48,020
Otherwise I’ll do it earlier or later, whatever
it is.

835
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:51,029
First of all keep this program, definite.

836
01:09:51,029 --> 01:10:15,630
See, Montpellier even if I don’t do, France
is there, it’s all right.

837
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:20,059
I can do it later on, doesn’t matter.

838
01:10:20,059 --> 01:10:27,880
But this I have to do, Spain, properly.

839
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,880
All right?

840
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:35,559
Rather awkward, I think, to go from there,
isn’t it?

841
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:37,510
There’s no flight.

842
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:40,760
It’s too much for Me.

843
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:51,230
Then I have to travel back, you know; I’m
coming from America all the way.

844
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:57,989
So forget about Montpellier.

845
01:10:57,989 --> 01:11:18,269
Somehow or other try to tell them that let’s
forget about it.

846
01:11:18,269 --> 01:11:35,159
See, I must also think how far I can go.

847
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:57,939
Then 

848
01:11:57,939 --> 01:13:05,590
I have to 
go 

849
01:13:05,590 --> 01:14:06,400
back 

850
01:14:06,400 --> 01:15:53,199
to 

851
01:15:53,199 --> 01:16:01,289
India – sixth or so, fifth or sixth, so
hardly any time for Me to prepare to go.

852
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,900
Also better keep it like that.

853
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:21,210
Just tell them that it may not be possible;
so I come back on Friday, it would be better.

854
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:28,010
I can come Saturday night, and Sunday morning
we can have the puja, if you like.

855
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:36,909
And Saturday arrive, Sunday puja, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday.

856
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:39,440
And Thursday morning I go back to London.

857
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,619
Because, you see, I’ll have hardly two weeks
left for Me to go to India.

858
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:47,760
It’s too much strain.

859
01:16:47,760 --> 01:17:00,789
So I won’t be able to do this time.

860
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:03,179
They can all come to France.

861
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:11,880
They can come to Paris.

862
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,030
Yes.

863
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,729
They should bring all the people.

864
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:20,199
And we have place there for people to live.

865
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:25,050
During that time there’s no problem.

866
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:29,939
France, when am I going?

867
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:30,939
Seventeenth?

868
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:35,809
Will it be cold now?

869
01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:36,809
No.

870
01:17:36,809 --> 01:17:40,400
After some time it will happen that I’ll
settle down in one place, and you’ll all

871
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,969
have to come there; because I won’t be able
to travel so much, I can tell you this much

872
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:47,989
– it’s all right for the time being.

873
01:17:47,989 --> 01:17:53,309
You must also understand that now, the Mohammed
has gone to the mountains; now the mountains

874
01:17:53,309 --> 01:17:57,519
have to come to the, to Mohammed.

875
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:59,709
All right.

876
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:00,750
So thank you very much.

877
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:29,860
You haven’t told Me any one of your problems,
so I think there are no problems!

878
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:39,500
Tomorrow morning I may not be able to meet
you, so may God bless you all.

879
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:52,769
Give yourself a bandhan now, all of you, properly,
with full attention, with full dignity, with

880
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,570
full movement.

881
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,369
See, full.

882
01:18:56,369 --> 01:19:06,369
Nothing should be done cheaply.

883
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:48,269
I don’t need anything, but just doing it
to please you all.

884
01:19:48,269 --> 01:19:58,139
In India they asked a question that if She’s
the Goddess, why does She say namaskar to

885
01:19:58,139 --> 01:19:59,139
everyone?

886
01:19:59,139 --> 01:21:00,080
They can’t understand that God is saying
namaskar!
