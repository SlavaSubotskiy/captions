1
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:05,099
I bow to all seekers of truth.

2
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:14,498
These are the special times when so many seekers
are born all over the world.

3
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:24,479
We are not aware as to the nature of this
time, when we get so much worried, anxious

4
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:35,159
and upset with so many things happening around
us and we do not find any answer to it.

5
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:44,179
Sometimes if you read some of the books which
give all the datas about what is expected

6
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:53,239
of human beings many people have now, I think,
accepted the ultimate doom and they think

7
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:59,779
that after all the doom has to come so why
worry.

8
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:07,529
Even Mohammad Sahib has talked about the doomsday
but much more than that he has talked about

9
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,529
the days of resurrection.

10
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:17,589
They all have talked about the future, the
day of judgement, the day of resurrection.

11
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:22,179
When is this going to happen and how it is
going to happen?

12
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,719
We have to first of all know that why are
we seekers and what are we seeking?

13
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:37,598
When I said that you are the seekers of truth
we have to find out first of all what is the

14
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,449
truth, and for that finding out we have to
just use some logic, we have to come to some

15
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:48,169
logical conclusion.

16
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:55,529
Now the first thing one must know that we
have become human beings from amoeba stage.

17
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:00,909
We have come to this stage with a purpose,
it is not purposeless.

18
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,329
But why have we become a human being?

19
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:11,158
There must be some purpose and if this purpose
has to be served it will be served not by

20
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:18,898
some sort of an outward happening but something
inward has to happen to our awareness.

21
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:25,669
Like animals do not have any awareness of
cleanliness, of beauty, but human beings have.

22
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:33,278
In the same way when we become a higher personality
we have to have something happening, happening

23
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,239
again I say, to our awareness.

24
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:42,388
And for this I would say Jung has done lot
of work, Jung who opposed Freud very much

25
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:52,108
and he said that if man has to evolve little
higher than what he is he will achieve his

26
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:59,489
own goal and according to him also the goal
of man is to become collectively conscious.

27
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:07,528
So even the scientists, the psychologists
have prepared the stage for our ascent.

28
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:13,878
Even Darwin who did not believe in God but
he did say that, " If man has come so far

29
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:21,047
he has to go still further somewhere at his
destination."

30
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:28,108
Even he would not accept a situation or a
proposition in which one has to say that there

31
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:32,358
is no purpose of nature in creating human
beings.

32
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:39,319
The second conclusion we have to come to very
logically, understandingly, is that the process

33
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:44,088
of evolution has been done by the living force
of life.

34
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,628
It's not done by something which is dead.

35
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:52,797
Like supposing we read the book it's all dead
work or if we stand on our heads or do any

36
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,518
such things we don't create anything.

37
00:30:55,518 --> 00:31:03,078
Living thing can be understood from, living
process can be understood from a living thing.

38
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:08,709
Like if you have got a seed and it looks like
a dead thing but you put it in the mother

39
00:31:08,709 --> 00:31:14,029
earth then it starts sprouting by itself,
spontaneously.

40
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,198
How it happens, why it happens we can't explain,
but it does.

41
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:23,899
You see for yourself that it happens and that
kind of a living force has worked out your

42
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:30,298
evolution without your knowledge but now in
your knowledge it has to happen.

43
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:35,859
That's the only difference between the evolutionary
process so far and further, and because it

44
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:42,429
has to be in your knowledge you are given
complete freedom to choose either the ascent

45
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:43,739
or the descent.

46
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:49,929
And when you come to this right conclusion
that it has to be done through some living

47
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:57,848
process then you must understand another point
that you cannot pay for it, not a single pi.

48
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:02,158
Because this is something very difficult for
human beings to understand that you can get

49
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,408
something without paying but you are getting
something.

50
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:08,579
You get the sun's rays without paying for
it.

51
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:13,978
Everything, this pay business and all, this
economic activity has been started by human

52
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:14,979
beings alone.

53
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:20,299
It's not done by God and perhaps God never
understands money at all but is all done by

54
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:25,278
human beings and also they want to bring in
God into the same pattern and say that you

55
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,299
can sell God.

56
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:30,139
You cannot organise God and you cannot sell
God.

57
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:35,978
So another conclusion we have to reach that
we cannot purchase God or His Divine Power,

58
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:40,269
this has to be brought to us spontaneously.

59
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:49,468
Means that we cannot sort of work it out ourselves,
it's some sort of a grace or we can say a

60
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:55,438
force that has to work it and when that grace
works it out we can become a higher personality

61
00:32:55,438 --> 00:33:01,799
as we have become higher personality so far.

62
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:08,258
Now this grace about which people have talked
that there is an all-pervading power everywhere

63
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:13,489
and this all-pervading power is doing every
living work.

64
00:33:13,489 --> 00:33:21,049
Like again I say when the living process where
we see a flower becoming a fruit, thousands

65
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:24,679
and thousands flowers we see are becoming
fruits.

66
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:25,679
How do they become?

67
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,549
They become spontaneously, but how?

68
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,649
A flower just becomes a fruit, we take it
for granted.

69
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:40,918
Now the thing is, this all-pervading power
is everywhere, is everywhere, and that pervading

70
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,878
power does this living job everywhere.

71
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:53,049
Not only that it makes a flower into a fruit
but also it decides which flower has to become

72
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,369
what fruit.

73
00:33:54,369 --> 00:34:04,158
It decides, it co-ordinates, it arranges,
it organises and it loves.

74
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:06,448
So this power we have to feel.

75
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:12,149
We never feel it, we see only nothing but
the breeze blowing but we don't see any power

76
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:14,447
being existing in this atmosphere.

77
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:22,468
The reason is this power is subtler for our
feelings, we cannot feel it, is the frequency

78
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,408
of this power we cannot feel.

79
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:31,378
"So how are we to feel this power?" is the
first question should come logically into

80
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:32,929
our head.

81
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,859
There must be something more must happen to
us we have to become subtler personality to

82
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:40,709
feel that power.

83
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:47,929
Now this becoming is the knowledge of the
roots, is not the knowledge of the tree.

84
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,139
Whatever we have achieved through our mental
projections or all discoveries and everything

85
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:58,728
we have done about nature, is we have put
them in the books and all that is nothing

86
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:00,668
but the knowledge of the tree.

87
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:09,538
But this tree is sustained by the roots and
these roots are sustaining this great tree

88
00:35:09,538 --> 00:35:15,149
which is growing, but if this tree doesn't
look after its roots a day will come that

89
00:35:15,149 --> 00:35:16,817
it is going to be destroyed.

90
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:21,748
And that's why people are frightened that
this creation is going to be destroyed now,

91
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:24,908
it's just on the verge of destruction.

92
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:34,669
Even the human beings who are the epitome
of great evolution have done nothing in totality

93
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:41,838
if you see the science has advanced more towards
destruction than towards construction.

94
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,129
It has constructed few things, all right,
but in a whole way supposing you construct

95
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:52,279
the whole house very beautifully, make everything
beautifully and decorate it nicely and then

96
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,979
you put a big bomb underneath it.

97
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:56,729
That's what we have done out of science.

98
00:35:56,729 --> 00:36:01,898
We have created all these nice things and
then we have got this hydrogen bomb, this

99
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:06,629
bomb, that bomb, planted on all the sites
that if a button is pressed the whole thing

100
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:10,388
can collapse whatever we have created with
such difficulty.

101
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:17,008
So look at the stupidity of our endeavour,
our enterprise, the way we have worked it

102
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:24,489
out that in totality we are just facing our
own destruction through our own mental projection.

103
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:30,569
So the other thing that has to happen to us
in our realization is that we find out a method

104
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:35,289
by which we understand the constructive side
of life.

105
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:43,088
Anything done without the Spirit in it, without
God's grace in it, leads you to destruction.

106
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:49,248
Even the elements can get upset with such
a society and can start destroying such societies

107
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:55,859
but if the elements do not take over it is
only the same societies which are trying to

108
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:01,658
elevate a society to higher level themselves
turn back upon themselves and start destroying

109
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,849
it.

110
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:10,039
Because there are no moorings for us, there
are no roots, because this kite which is flying

111
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,958
has lost its attachments.

112
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:15,059
The attachment has to be to the Spirit.

113
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:20,879
Shri Krishna has said that "Yogakshema (spelling
? sounds like -- na me hum u hum) that you

114
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:25,588
get your 'yoga', means 'union with the Divine'.

115
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:31,599
Once you get union with the Divine then I
look after, "I look after yogashema" means,

116
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,768
"I look after your well-being", is said by
Shri Krishna.

117
00:37:35,768 --> 00:37:39,689
But he doesn't say that first I will look
after yogakshema and then you get your yoga

118
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:44,119
it's the other way round, you have to take
to your yoga.

119
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,069
Now the right conclusion about yoga we should
find out what is yoga.

120
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:54,018
Now many people think that doing hatha yoga,
which is just a little bit of standing on

121
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:56,158
your head business, is yoga.

122
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,159
It is not.

123
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,969
It is very commonly said, "I am doing my yoga".

124
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:03,319
I mean you can't 'do' yoga you have to be
'in' yoga.

125
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:10,708
'Yoga' means 'union with the Divine' and this
happens to you, it just happens to you by

126
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:16,179
which you become connected with your Spirit,
what Christ has said is the rebirth, we are

127
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:17,689
to be born again.

128
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:23,189
But human beings are so much deceptive to
themselves, they deceive themselves so much

129
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:27,229
that I have known people that when I went
to America I told them that you have to be

130
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:28,869
born again and all that.

131
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:33,947
After that some of them started an organisation
called as Born Again and they just self-certified

132
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,729
themselves that, "We are born again."

133
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:40,929
But I mean how can you certify yourself as
born again when you haven't got the qualities,

134
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:45,029
the capacities and the powers of a twice-born
personality?

135
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:54,318
Now we have to understand also that if it
is going to be a new birth, a transformation

136
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:55,948
must take place within us.

137
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:58,429
We must have a transformation.

138
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:03,909
But you'll find that all efforts people have
put it in of conditioning, giving puritanical

139
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:10,779
ideas and doing all sorts of things it has
not been able to give people transformation.

140
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:14,148
It has not led to any transformation.

141
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:20,169
On the contrary, their addictions to all kinds
of habits, addiction to all kinds of thoughts

142
00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:25,239
and also enslavement to all sorts of conditioning
has not at all vanished.

143
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:30,339
In some way or other if they are communists,
they become capitalists, if they are capitalists

144
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,339
they become communist.

145
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:37,349
You see from one to another you are going
into some sort of an ism, ism, ism, ism.

146
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:43,699
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like this
because you are only human beings, only human

147
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,169
beings in the eyes of God.

148
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:51,049
He has created variety he has created one
variety of say, Australians, then in Australia

149
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,029
also he has created so many varieties as you
have so many flowers we have so many human

150
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,029
beings.

151
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:04,669
But inside every flower flows this vital force
of God's love and that vital force is to be

152
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:11,479
understood through going into the roots not
from outside through your mental projection.

153
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,708
Actually through your mental projection how
far can you go?

154
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:22,419
Because it's a limited brain that you are
using to understand a problem but you have

155
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,419
to go to the unlimited.

156
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:30,859
If it is so, something has to trigger it,
your ascent, into that space where it is unlimited

157
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:35,758
and that's why we have to know that through
only logical conclusion we can come up to

158
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:42,018
the door but afterwards you have to enter
through this door through that triggering

159
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,309
otherwise you cannot enter into it.

160
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:51,079
Now whatever he has told you all about these
chakras you need not believe as Dr Warren

161
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:52,079
has told you.

162
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,299
There's no need to believe into it because
even if you have blind faith it's not going

163
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:57,578
to help us.

164
00:40:57,578 --> 00:41:05,888
But as a scientist you must keep your mind
open and you must accept this as a hypothesis

165
00:41:05,888 --> 00:41:07,229
placed before you.

166
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:13,198
Now this hypothesis if it is proved right
you have to accept it as a law, the Divine

167
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:14,239
law.

168
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:21,078
Now this hypothesis is that you have got all
these seven centers within you and you have

169
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:27,169
got the power called as the Kundalini placed
in the triangular bone.

170
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:33,279
Now one may say that this is a Sanskrit word
and Sanskrit is not for only Indians it is

171
00:41:33,279 --> 00:41:34,578
for all of us.

172
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:38,329
As English language is for all of us, in the
same way Sanskrit is also for all of us.

173
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:44,919
But only thing I would say, that as the west
was more busy, and you though you are on the

174
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:50,489
east but still I call it the west, busy with
the advancement outside, there were people

175
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:54,518
who were busy with the advancement down.

176
00:41:54,518 --> 00:42:01,668
And these people are the seers who have seen
that there is a power which is settled down

177
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,919
in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

178
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,369
Now this is a Greek word.

179
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:10,059
It is very interesting to know that sacrum
means sacred.

180
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:14,749
And I asked the Greeks when I went to Greece
I asked them, "Why do you call it sacrum?"

181
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:21,019
They said that, "Most of these words have
come to us because we have had a very long

182
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:24,429
rapport with the Indo-Aryan groups."

183
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:26,509
"So when was that?"

184
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:31,578
They said, "It was much before Alexander went
to India."

185
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:36,099
So we knew about India long time back and
the Indians told us that this is a sacred

186
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:37,099
bone.

187
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:41,469
Even doctors know that when the whole body
burns this bone does not burn.

188
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:49,498
It takes lot of temperature, very high temperature
to burn this bone and when you put it in the

189
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:54,838
cremation this thing and all that, that has
to brought to a very high temperature so that

190
00:42:54,838 --> 00:43:02,139
this bone should burn but with other temperatures,
lower temperatures, the whole body may burn

191
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:05,469
but this bone will remain still unburned.

192
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:09,638
So the reason is there is this power which
is protecting it.

193
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:15,559
Now this power is called as Kundalini because
it has got three and a half coils within it.

194
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,818
You might have read some of you, being seekers,
you must have read books about Kundalini and

195
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:24,398
everywhere I go people tell me that, "Mother
we have heard that this is a very dangerous

196
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:30,059
thing to have the Kundalini awakened and it's
very, very wrong to touch it."

197
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:33,539
Now this is something absurd.

198
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,148
First of all this is the only way you are
going to get your realisation.

199
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:42,369
Is the primule, is the germ within you, the
germinating power within you which is going

200
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:48,469
to give you the ascent and how can that be
a thing that will be dangerous for you.

201
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:49,929
There must be something wrong.

202
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:53,679
For example, I don't understand about this
instrument or about electricity.

203
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,818
I'll put my both the fingers in the plug and
I get a shock and I say, "Oh, it's the most

204
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:03,158
dangerous thing that you can have," that means
I don't know how to handle it.

205
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:08,589
But Kundalini when She is said to be troubling
people it is never the Kundalini but this

206
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:15,148
first centre of innocence which gets into
annoyance and when it gets into annoyance

207
00:44:15,148 --> 00:44:21,948
it sends lot of heat in the body and that
heat is felt in the body by so many people.

208
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:30,779
When people who have no authority from God
Almighty, we can say, those who are not holy

209
00:44:30,779 --> 00:44:35,849
people, those who are making money in the
name of God, those who are people with very

210
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:42,129
bad characters who have no possibility of
even taking the name of God such people when

211
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:47,708
they try these tricks it happens to you that
you feel that tremendous heat in the body.

212
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:51,969
One must know that heat is not a sign of spirituality.

213
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:58,149
Everywhere, whether is in Sanskrit or any
language, they have said that it's a cooling,

214
00:44:58,149 --> 00:44:59,359
it cools you down.

215
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,059
Even a person you say, "He's cool minded",
means he's not violent.

216
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:11,759
Now in science if you try to cool down the
helium gas they, you'll find that when it

217
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:15,739
is not cooled down, it is heated up, all molecules
fight each other.

218
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:18,859
They become so violent that they hit each
other.

219
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,889
They form certain groups hit each other, and
then these groups also again hit each other.

220
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:30,319
But when helium gas is cooled down they all
become collective and they start behaving

221
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,989
in a manner that is very collective.

222
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:39,969
So the idea is people who say that with Kundalini
you get tremendous heat, you start jumping,

223
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:45,259
and people told me that they start jumping
like a frog.

224
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:49,689
One gentleman sitting before me had put both
his legs on the ground he was sitting.

225
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:54,679
So they said, "You can't put these feet towards
Mother".

226
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:57,119
So I asked him, I called him, "What's the
problem?"

227
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,379
You see, Indians understand how to respect
a saint.

228
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:00,488
So I said, "What's the problem?

229
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:02,499
Why are you putting your legs towards me?"

230
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:07,239
He said, "Mother, if I sit with folded feet
I start jumping like a frog".

231
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:09,629
So I said, "Are you going to become a frog
now?

232
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:10,629
Just think about it!

233
00:46:10,629 --> 00:46:13,188
You are not going to become a frog or a bird.

234
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:16,009
You are going to become a higher personality.

235
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:18,869
Who has told you that you are becoming a frog?"

236
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:24,389
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by a guru
and he has given me this book and in that

237
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:28,738
book it was written", (actually I saw it with
my own eyes, what a misleading thing!), "that

238
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:34,879
he is a person who gets his Kundalini awakened
starts jumping like a frog."

239
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:42,998
Now all these absurd things must be understood
that all abnormalities are dropped out after

240
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:48,479
you become the Spirit because that's the most
beautiful thing you have.

241
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:55,479
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and
when the Kundalini rises and pierces through

242
00:46:55,479 --> 00:47:03,649
your fontanelle bone area where you actually
get your baptism that time you become a beautiful

243
00:47:03,649 --> 00:47:12,929
person, a decent person, a sweet person, a
nice person and you forget all your violence.

244
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:18,038
Not only that but you feel the love for others
and not violence.

245
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:25,189
Your ego drops out, your superego drops out,
means your conditioning drops out.

246
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:30,959
If these transformations don't take place
what's the serve of becoming the Spirit?

247
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:33,819
So the ideas people have that you start jumping.

248
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:37,889
I know of so many people now who have been
to fake gurus.

249
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:42,599
And this point I must bring to you because
everywhere I went the newspaper people ask

250
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,479
me about the fake gurus.

251
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:53,639
The other day a American lady asked me in
an interview of radio at Perth that, "How

252
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:59,708
do you explain that the people who are seekers,
the young people, they go to India and they

253
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:06,829
end up penniless and sometimes they get epilepsy
or they take to drugs?

254
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:13,339
Or they become jobless, useless, they live
like cabbages and they have nothing to contribute

255
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:15,859
to the society or to themselves.

256
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,099
How do we explain that?"

257
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:20,859
She says I've got the datas to show you.

258
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,609
I said, "I agreed".

259
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:29,839
I do feel ashamed that these gurus who are
not only fake but they are criminals they

260
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,309
go into another country to make money.

261
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,309
I agree.

262
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:34,309
I accept.

263
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:39,659
But also I would blame the people who go to
them.

264
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,329
They are naïve, simple people.

265
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:47,929
They are the ones who are earnestly seeking
but you must come to some logical conclusion

266
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:49,438
about everything.

267
00:48:49,439 --> 00:48:54,609
That is important, because you are here to
get to your Spirit and not to get to a guru.

268
00:48:54,609 --> 00:49:00,429
That's one thing one must know that we have
to be the Spirit and not be attached or be

269
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:04,089
sort of enslaved by any guru whatsoever.

270
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:07,708
The guru resides within you in your heart
and your Spirit is your heart.

271
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:11,009
Only thing somebody has to trigger it just
to become that.

272
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:16,609
But the amount of enslavement and all these
things people undergo for nothing at all.

273
00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:18,169
You cannot pay for it.

274
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:23,409
Anybody who takes money from you is a parasite,
you must know, whether he may be calling himself

275
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,768
anything, by any name.

276
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:26,429
Don't listen to such a person.

277
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:30,079
Now I've been telling all the people for the
last fourteen years.

278
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,819
I was the one fourteen years back, in a very
big hall, at least five, six times bigger

279
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:40,659
than this, called as Jehangi Hall in Bombay,
I spoke so loudly about all of them.

280
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:44,649
I told their names I told them what they were,
how devilish they are.

281
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:45,768
Keep out from them.

282
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,449
But nobody would listen to me.

283
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:50,939
Even when I went to America, in the beginning,
nobody would listen to me.

284
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:52,549
I told them that, "Be careful.

285
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:55,919
These fake gurus are out, they are going to
loot you.

286
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:57,419
Be careful about them.!"

287
00:49:57,419 --> 00:50:02,159
But nobody would listen to me on this point
because they were so enamoured.

288
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,089
On the contrary, they were teaching me some
wisdom.

289
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:08,799
"Mother, you must take some money otherwise
Americans won't understand.

290
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:12,109
If, unless and until they pay for it they
are not going to understand".

291
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,079
I said, "How do you underestimate them?"

292
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,198
They said, "It's true".

293
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:20,119
And I tell you I ended up with some disciples
there or some people who got realisation,

294
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:22,749
but I was so frustrated.

295
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:28,619
I asked one great saint of India to go down
to New York about two years back, and he ran

296
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:29,619
away.

297
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:30,619
He ran away.

298
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:32,718
He said, "I can't manage these Americans.

299
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:37,379
Their whole thinking is just the other way
round, about God, about everything".

300
00:50:37,379 --> 00:50:42,319
Now there were people who were teaching that
you can approach God through sex.

301
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:47,859
I mean absurd things, it's obtuse, absolutely
it is opposite of what God is.

302
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:52,958
Not that in Sahaja Yoga we disregard sex,
sex is a part of life.

303
00:50:52,959 --> 00:50:57,689
But sex does not play any part in the ascent
you can see because the first centre here

304
00:50:57,689 --> 00:51:02,799
Mooladhara is for your excretion and for your
sex.

305
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:09,189
So we do not in any way condemn it, but it
has its own sanctity and its own channelising.

306
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:16,729
If you become sort of perverted about it you
develop diseases, there are problems and anything

307
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:19,419
that is divine cannot give you a disease.

308
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:24,728
So another conclusion they should have reached,
I think, that if you are sick, your head is

309
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:30,039
going, reeling, if you are feeling unhappy,
sickly and you don't know what to do then

310
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:31,969
why should you stick onto that guru?

311
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,599
Because just you have paid for it?

312
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,718
It's like if you go to a drama and it's boring,
you don't like it but you said, "Now we've

313
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,209
paid for it so go through it".

314
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:43,439
That's all right because drama doesn't make
you mad, you see, but this kind of thing which

315
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:46,679
is so dangerous even if you have paid, finish
with it.

316
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,298
Now we started that we have had enough of
this man.

317
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:52,749
Now they are buying Rolls Royces, they are
buying aeroplanes.

318
00:51:52,749 --> 00:51:54,799
Look at where is their attention.

319
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:59,729
They're more bothered about gathering money
to themselves and having other people's money

320
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:04,319
as they call them opium and live on that and
thrive on that and why don't you use your

321
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,319
brains to understand that how can you pay
for your realisation?

322
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,349
It's one of your mistakes, I think, not to
understand that anyone who is interested in

323
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,289
your purse is not interested in your Spirit.

324
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:22,839
Then apart from that there are so many other
mistakes people have committed in pursuit

325
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,009
of God.

326
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:30,849
One has to know that when you get your Spirit
you get your own powers.

327
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,589
I may say I'm as these people have said that,
"She's the greatest saint".

328
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:36,669
All right.

329
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:40,968
If they have said it I say, "All right, because
all the saints in India say so about Me, so

330
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,539
all right, I agree".

331
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:43,769
But I need not say that.

332
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:47,449
Even if I say, "I'm the greatest", why should
you believe in it?

333
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:48,919
What have you got?

334
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:51,389
What powers have you got out of it?

335
00:52:51,389 --> 00:52:53,669
What have you achieved out of it is the point.

336
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:58,228
Is should be absolutely clear cut to you that
unless and until you get your realisation

337
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:02,579
you should not (sounds like pujout) and you
should not accept Sahaja Yoga is the ultimate.

338
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:07,569
You must try to get your realisation, you
must get the mastery over it.

339
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:11,669
Unless and until you have done it what's the
use of all Sahaja Yoga done to you.

340
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:15,448
After all it is to transform you into a new
life.

341
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:20,909
Transform you, what is your own, is all your
own property, I would say.

342
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,248
Everything is like a trust.

343
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:24,829
I sometimes say I'm like a banker.

344
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:30,849
Now you put your money in the bank and I'm
just a banker who has to give your money.

345
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:37,319
I'm little a very gracious banker so I may
give double, four times, five times, ten times,

346
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:38,799
that's a different point.

347
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:46,419
But you are seekers so you are 'men of God'
as described by another very great saint of

348
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:47,738
England, William Blake.

349
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:55,079
He says he has described all these things
to us very clearly that at this time men of

350
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:02,799
God will be born and they will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophet.

351
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,909
He has said so clear, everything is so clear-cut,
you can't imagine.

352
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:11,789
If you read him you will be amazed that he
has even mentioned where the ashram for Sahaja

353
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:16,799
Yoga will be, where I will be staying, into
all details he has mentioned and you must

354
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:21,219
have heard the story of Jerusalem that England
will become chaste.

355
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:26,479
I mean if you are (inaudible) what they have
been doing about hundred years back in India

356
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:33,159
nobody could have believed the stories that
he said, but he could see that the same land

357
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:41,278
which is so aggressive today will become the
land of peace, harmony and of spiritualism.

358
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:46,189
Australia especially I have tremendous respect
for Australia as a land because it plays a

359
00:54:46,189 --> 00:54:49,509
very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:55,399
This first centre is the Mooladhara, is Australia.

361
00:54:55,399 --> 00:55:00,549
Australia is the Mooladhara of the whole universe
and I find every Australian when I meet them

362
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:04,679
there's a kind of an innocence in him which
is still showing now.

363
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:08,798
Of course, innocence can never be destroyed,
it can be covered but it can never be destroyed.

364
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,569
I have seen that in Australians there is a
kind of an innocence which shows very sweetly

365
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:17,929
and that's where it works out very fast.

366
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:24,298
Now Dr Warren he first came to me, and his
friend, and in the beginning they were very

367
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:27,689
volatile people, extremely angry, hot tempered
and all that, you see.

368
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:32,279
And they came to me when I was on my way to
Pune so I said, "All right, you come along

369
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:33,499
with me, I haven't got time".

370
00:55:33,499 --> 00:55:38,499
I think they came to My house and they touched
their realisation but still they were so volatile

371
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:39,659
and so angry.

372
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:41,988
So I said, "All right, you come along with
Me to Pune".

373
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:44,389
And you see in Sahaja Yoga we don't take any
money.

374
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:47,958
Naturally, you see, we haven't got very good
arrangements for you.

375
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:51,629
If you want you can stay in a hotel, if you
want, but as far as we are concerned whatever

376
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:58,009
Sahaja Yogis had arranged in those days, so
we arranged for them to stay in a (what was

377
00:55:58,009 --> 00:56:04,509
that?) a, some place, all right, and there
there was a doctor from England and these

378
00:56:04,509 --> 00:56:08,979
two persons and there was only one mattress
for three of them, you see.

379
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:10,929
There was troubling, pushing each other.

380
00:56:10,929 --> 00:56:16,829
In the morning, you see, they got up and they
got into the rickshaw, saying, all their luggage

381
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:17,829
there.

382
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:18,829
I said, "Why?"

383
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:20,188
"We slept on the cement", you see.

384
00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:21,569
I said, "How?"

385
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:24,259
"We slept on the cement", thrice+.

386
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:25,259
They went on.

387
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:26,259
I said, "What's the matter?"

388
00:56:26,259 --> 00:56:27,829
I said, "How did you sleep on the cement?

389
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:29,279
They didn't give you any mattress?"

390
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:30,279
"No, nothing.

391
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:34,529
That fellow from England he was snatching
our mattress all the time and we could not

392
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:36,689
sleep and we slept on the cement."

393
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:42,599
And in that I felt the sweetness of it, how
sweetly they were telling Me their problems.

394
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,099
It's such a simple problem to sleep on the
cement but sleeping on the cement helps a

395
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,218
lot, (they did not know at that time), which
helps quite a lot that the Mother Earth sucks

396
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:52,319
your problems.

397
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,759
So it was all arranged perhaps that they should
be on the cement.

398
00:56:55,759 --> 00:57:01,689
But the way they were angry so sweetly and
everybody enjoyed that anger so much in Pune

399
00:57:01,689 --> 00:57:07,199
and then they got their realisation and I
knew that something good has to happen.

400
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,889
Once an Australian gets their realisation
it will work out very fast.

401
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:14,688
That's what exactly what happened in their
case and should happen everywhere.

402
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:19,869
I'm very happy on my tour last time in Sydney
we did very well.

403
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:26,159
And then we had also this time some program
at Perth for the first time.

404
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:31,819
Many people, about three hundred people, got
realisation and it was wonderful and the whole

405
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:37,979
thing worked out in such a beautiful way that
I am so much encouraged to be here to be with

406
00:57:37,979 --> 00:57:42,249
all of you and to do this job, because this
is the job I am here for.

407
00:57:42,249 --> 00:57:45,999
For this you don't have to do anything.

408
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:50,089
First I have to work and then you have to
work for others.

409
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:55,500
There are so many who are lost, so many who
are seekers all over the world it's not in

410
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,519
Australia only, everywhere.

411
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,949
They have taken to drugs out of seeking, they
have taken to these gurus also out of their

412
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:06,819
seeking, all these problems have come to these
seekers.

413
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:13,449
Even too, I've seen people who were quite
of my age group they told me they have been

414
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:17,609
to some guru in America and who wanted to
cut their tongues.

415
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:20,708
All sorts of things they have been trying.

416
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:23,619
You don't have to do anything like that.

417
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:28,228
You have to be quite intact but only thing
that light within you which is the Spirit

418
00:58:28,229 --> 00:58:30,569
has to shine into your attention.

419
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:33,019
Tomorrow I'll tell you what is self realisation.

420
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:37,449
Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what is self
realisation and also I'll tell you about the

421
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:38,449
chakras.

422
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:42,239
In any case they have given you the books
which are of course just the beginning of

423
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,999
the whole thing is, you can see and read it
and understand what are these chakras and

424
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,219
what do they do.

425
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:55,409
There's nothing to be afraid of, nothing to
be worried, it's your own, it has to happen

426
00:58:55,409 --> 00:59:00,119
spontaneously, it happens absolutely without
any trouble or torture to you.

427
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:06,968
It may happen to all of you, it may happen
to some of you and whatever it is we have

428
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:14,719
come here for this purpose only and I'll work
out till my last breath to see that you get

429
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:15,739
what you deserve.

430
00:59:15,739 --> 00:59:17,531
May God bless you.
