1
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,560
...which expresses itself in the gross

2
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,560
out of these subtle centers.

3
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,560
The left hand side of our subtle body is the blue column

4
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,520
is our psyche. It's our emotions. It's our past.

5
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
It's the part of us which is

6
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,480
is our conditioning and creates what we might call our superego,

7
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,960
our response mechanism, our reflex mechanism.

8
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
It's our memory.

9
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,040
The right hand side is our projection.

10
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
It relates to our planning. It relates to our

11
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
thinking, thinking, thinking.

12
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,480
And of course it relates to our ego.

13
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,360
It's the mechanism by which we reach rational conclusions.

14
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,520
It's through the right hand side that we analyze

15
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,680
and calculate and reach certain,

16
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,480
often illogical but rational conclusions.

17
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
So we have to be careful that these imbalances

18
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,320
do not express themselves within us to any great extent,

19
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,360
while the tendency is that while we will

20
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
move either too far to the left side

21
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
or too far to the right side and so

22
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,200
move beyond our own personal subconscious

23
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,440
or our own personal supraconscious

24
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,760
into an area which is

25
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,920
totally deluding and quite often dangerous

26
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
which is called the collective subconscious

27
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,840
the collective supraconscious which is

28
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
occupied by spirits of the dead

29
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,760
which can and do possess us.

30
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,480
It ranges from dangerous zones

31
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,600
which give us such problems as alcoholism, cancer,

32
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,880
all sorts of power complexes

33
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,680
the ultimate example of Hitler.

34
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,080
So we have to be extraordinarily careful

35
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,880
of these dabbling and [DILATANTE?] attitudes towards our seeking.

36
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,160
I've been dealing with sick people in my professional life

37
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,960
and I've seen so many seekers who've

38
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
not only gone to these false gurus

39
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,240
and have been damaged

40
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,960
and come back worse for the spiritual pilgrimage.

41
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,760
But I've seen many others who have

42
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,920
been equally damaged although perhaps not quite so

43
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,960
openly and so obviously

44
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,440
such other more socially acceptable forms of seeking

45
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
such as these courses in clairvoyance,

46
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,880
such as charismatic church movement where

47
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,800
there is obvious spiritual possession,

48
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,200
such as in for example the

49
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,560
calling down of spirits in the spiritualists church, such as

50
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,160
sitting in trance in circle and so on.

51
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,920
We have to be careful of all of these areas as well

52
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
and I said we have to be very careful of healing

53
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,760
because who might be healing might be

54
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,880
the power of a very, very busy body or

55
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,880
ego oriented spirit that is using our body

56
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,520
to achieve his own ego trip through us.

57
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,000
Mind you

58
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,440
the person who is the host has to have a rather big ego as well

59
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,600
to be an acceptable host to that busy body.

60
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,120
But never mind.

61
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
This is often what happens.

62
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,720
It has happened to me and I openly admit it.

63
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,320
Since gaining my Self-realization

64
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,040
I gained a power which is far more subtle,

65
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,120
but far more all embracing and that is the power of God.

66
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,400
The power that loves, that coordinates, that balances,

67
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,640
that dissolves all the negativity.

68
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,560
Not by some trick of laying on of hands

69
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
and you start shaking and sweating

70
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
and some temporary relief takes place in the

71
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
physical body.

72
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,920
Not perhaps as for example as I watched for two years

73
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,440
the Pilipino healers,

74
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,280
where with all sorts of monsters they play around with tissue

75
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,320
and they use spirits

76
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,480
who dematerialize tissue and rematerialize tissue.

77
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
This is dangerous nonsense

78
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,880
and often interferes with the spiritual progress

79
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,400
of the patient and certainly the person who's doing the job.

80
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,160
So beware of all these rather fringe areas,

81
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,080
these danger zones in the field of spiritual seeking

82
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,600
and take to Sahaja Yoga because here you get your own powers.

83
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,160
And those powers are very very subtle, very very sweet.

84
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,160
And they are totally unrelated to spirit possession.

85
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,640
I'm dwelling a little on spirit possession because

86
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,160
perhaps Mother tonight will speak of that chakra where

87
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,160
this is a problem, the Swadhistan Chakra.

88
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,240
So in our seeking take great care.

89
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,960
Take great care that you have your own powers,

90
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,720
that you are in control, that you become the master.

91
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,280
This is what Self-realization gives you.

92
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,320
gives you that joy of the Spirit.

93
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,920
It gives you that contact with the Divine

94
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,640
and you develop it.

95
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,280
You find that your physical ills get better.

96
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,160
You find that you can give realization to others.

97
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,560
You find that you can become your own doctor

98
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,680
and the doctor to others

99
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,360
and you can enjoy the sweetness of collectivity

100
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,080
of really having brothers and sisters.

101
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,800
Not talking about it but becoming

102
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,760
a very very beautiful part of an emerging spiritual civilization

103
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,560
which has been promised in all the scriptures.

104
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,320
If Mataji is the one who can do the job,

105
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,320
if She's the one who can, by Her power and love,

106
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,280
raise this kundalini,

107
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,040
be humble enough to accept it.

108
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,320
Take it at least as a hypothesis.

109
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,960
Allow it to develop within yourself.

110
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,040
She suggests for at least eight days.

111
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,720
Find out.

112
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
Develop it. Work it out.

113
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
Know your own powers.

114
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,920
Maneuver it.

115
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,680
Allow yourself to

116
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,000
enjoy the giving realization to others

117
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,440
and ultimately know that you are the Spirit.

118
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,560
This is what it is. It's what you've been seeking.

119
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,600
And yet I can't convince you.

120
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
You have to find that out for yourself.

121
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,120
In fact you needn't believe anything that I've said.

122
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,640
What you have to do is you have to establish your vibrations.

123
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,200
You have to establish your kundalini awakening

124
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,280
in such a way that you in fact

125
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,400
prove for yourself that what I say is the truth.

126
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,240
Again ladies and  gentlemen it is my great pleasure

127
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
to introduce to you

128
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,840
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

129
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,040
Perhaps while the film crew is finishing off their work

130
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
I can just familiarize you with the chakras

131
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,600
chakras because these centers may be a little foreign to you

132
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,320
in terms of names so

133
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,200
this Mooladhara Chakra lies

134
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,760
at the area which is at the base of the spine. Right here.

135
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,760
It relates to such areas of the spine- areas of the body

136
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,520
as the prostate gland. It relates to our sex and our sex organs

137
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
and supplies the energy in that area of the body.

138
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,040
It's also related to the sacral and coccygeal plexus

139
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,440
in the gross body.

140
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
And that's the center which has to be awakened.

141
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,320
That's the center which

142
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,200
has to begin the job of giving you Self-realization because

143
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,760
here coiled up in the sacrum is the kundalini.

144
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,080
Notice how it's above.

145
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,360
Mother will explain in a moment

146
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,840
a very significant point

147
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,880
that this center is abovethe Mooladhara Chakra

148
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,040
because it's the center of holiness.

149
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,760
It's the center of the holy Mother within you.

150
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,520
It's the center of the Holy Ghost within you.

151
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,560
So again ladies and gentlemen with that little bit of understanding,

152
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,480
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

153
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,280
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

154
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,960
As I told yesterday to you that truth is what it is.

155
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
It will be what it will be.

156
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,920
You cannot change truth for your adaptation

157
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,240
or for your mental projection

158
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,360
or for your own convenience.

159
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,600
It will remain whatever it is.

160
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,640
The first point of truth is

161
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,680
that it establishes itself

162
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,160
despite all kinds of agencies

163
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,320
or all kinds of forces which are anti-god.

164
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Second it is that it caters for the honest seekers.

165
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,880
It's like a little root coming out of the seed,

166
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,400
goes round and round, fix itself onto the source.

167
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,640
The third is that it may shatter some of your ideas.

168
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,280
It may upset some of your convictions.

169
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,240
But when it appears it is such a great joy

170
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,200
that absolutely you are lost

171
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
in the ocean of that enjoyment.

172
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,640
You forget everything that you have lost.

173
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,880
You're happy that you have lost that dirty boat of yours.

174
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,920
That hanging and everything that you had

175
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,400
and now that you have become one with the ocean of joy.

176
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,560
The truth is your Spirit.

177
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,720
It is eternal. It is the expression of God within you.

178
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,080
Because we have not been able to achieve

179
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
that in our consciousness,

180
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,560
we are disturbed, upset,

181
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,880
feel sometimes as if we are ruined people.

182
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,960
But Spirit cannot be ruined.

183
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
It cannot be dried out.

184
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,400
It cannot be killed.

185
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,960
It resurrects you,

186
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,320
fills you up with all the blessings of the Divine.

187
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,240
That's the connection you have to get.

188
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,400
Any instrument that is made

189
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,680
if it is not connected to the mains has no meaning.

190
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,560
In the same way you are made so beautifully,

191
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
so gloriously and delicately.

192
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,840
That only thing you have to so it to put to the mains .

193
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,040
And the joy of becoming yourself is fantastic.

194
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,800
So the second point  which I said was that

195
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,840
it can be shattered - your conviction.

196
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,440
And that's why I have to tell you that when you listen to Me,

197
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,440
you should not get upset.

198
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,680
It is not at all to upset you.

199
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,080
I have nothing to get from you, nothing to get.

200
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,200
This is your own property within you

201
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,160
and you have to remove all the shackles,

202
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,240
all the overpowering ignorance

203
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,600
and just get to the truth as it is and as it manifests.

204
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
The manifestation of the truth the Spirit

205
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,640
is beyond human understanding

206
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,840
in the sense that it is a happening.

207
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,320
It happens to you that you become the Spirit.

208
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,360
And something that has to happen

209
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,480
cannot be comprehended with this limited brain

210
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,320
because I'm talking about something that is unlimited.

211
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,480
So you have to

212
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,160
be prepared to be triggered into the space

213
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,840
which is unlimited.

214
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,280
This happening is definitely miraculous and spontaneous.

215
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,880
It is the greatest happening

216
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,240
that the human being can ever think of.

217
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,240
It's described in short

218
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,560
in so many verses of Koran.

219
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,360
Quite clearly it was stated by Christ that you are to be born again.

220
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,360
But Indian seers have seen it

221
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,760
very clearly everything that works it out.

222
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,240
They don't have any religion.

223
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,560
They don't follow any organization. They are seers.

224
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,320
And they all have seen how it works out.

225
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,320
The knowledge that I'm telling you is not of today.

226
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,360
But even 14,000 years back Markandeya, a great poet in India,

227
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,320
has written about it.

228
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,600
Of course I have brought it to the modern standard to explain you.

229
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,480
But when you read Markandeya you'll be amazed

230
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,400
after realization that from his book you'll be getting vibrations.

231
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Recently about hundred years back

232
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,840
William Blake, such a great poet of England,

233
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,880
has written absolutely everything about Sahaja Yoga

234
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,120
how it is going work.

235
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,200
He has written that the men of God will become prophets

236
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,720
and these prophets will have powers to make others prophet.

237
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,720
Clearly [he or He?] had said it.

238
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,560
But I wonder how many people read [him or Him?] to understand

239
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,680
what to expect that you have to become the prophet.

240
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,720
If people say, "I am a prophet." All right so what.

241
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,200
It makes no difference to you if I am a prophet.

242
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,640
But you have to become the prophet.

243
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,280
That's what [he or He?] has clearly said.

244
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,080
He has clearly said so many things that amazingly

245
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,960
we have found even the places we were have got our ashrams.

246
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,600
Even the place where I live

247
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,200
[he or He] has very clearly stated the exact address of the place.

248
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,680
What a seer England had

249
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,360
and then ultimately [he or He?] says Jerusalem.

250
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,840
England is going to be a Jerusalem nobody could have believed

251
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,880
three hundred years back

252
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,600
or even two hundred years back years, back even hundred years back.

253
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,520
Even yesterday that is possible

254
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,240
that English would represent Jerusalem.

255
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,320
The place of pilgrimage

256
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,920
where people will go for pilgrimage.

257
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,440
But today I would say it is becoming.

258
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,400
It is happening in England and should happen in Australia also

259
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,440
because I said Australia has a special place, very special place.

260
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,680
In the cosmos of this universe

261
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,200
Australia is this great center, the first center of Mooladhara.

262
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,360
And the proof of that is Aires Rock

263
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,840
which has the same color the same shape.

264
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,920
The deity's face also the same with the trunk in front.

265
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,800
Australia stands for innocence.

266
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,920
I wonder how many have retained their innocence.

267
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,440
They are innocent by birth.

268
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,120
By the way God has blessed you.

269
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,440
An innocent man is the wisest man. Is the wisest person.

270
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,120
And he takes to wisdom very much easily.

271
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,640
Only thing the confidence should be there and the self esteem

272
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
about yourself.

273
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,840
These are the only two things which will bring out

274
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,720
that innocence within you

275
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,040
which has to help the whole world to come around.

276
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,160
I have great hopes from Australia

277
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,960
because God has created it with a very big purpose.

278
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,840
So as he has told you today

279
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,640
about these three things we have

280
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,160
I will give you the permutations and combinations of these

281
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,960
how they work out within us.

282
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,240
So please listen with understanding

283
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,960
that whatever doesn't go with you,

284
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,400
your ideas, you should not bother about it.

285
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,640
. I'm sure we will be able to prove it to you that this is so.

286
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,400
Now the first power that is within us is the power of desire.

287
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,720
The power of desire is the one that exists

288
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,760
but is not apparent.

289
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,560
This is the power which gives us emotions

290
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,720
or is the power of our psyche, as they call it.

291
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,760
This is the power that creates by its activity

292
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,680
on top of your head,

293
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,360
more on the right hand side,

294
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,920
an institution called as superego.

295
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,720
Means all your conditionings are stored there.

296
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,760
This works for your memory. For your past.

297
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,000
And beyond that lies the area -

298
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,080
beyond the left side lies the area of collective subconscious

299
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,800
because this looks after your subconscious.

300
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,800
And beyond that is the collective subconscious.

301
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,520
Means the area which is built within us since the creation.

302
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,240
The complete dead is on the left hand side.

303
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
On the right hand side

304
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,640
there's another power which works out the action

305
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,880
so we call it the power of action

306
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,880
by which we act

307
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,880
for our physical expression

308
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
and for our mental expression.

309
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,040
By which we think for the future.

310
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
By which we plan out things.

311
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,680
By which we rationalize and create another pouch like a balloon

312
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,320
which is called as ego as a byproduct

313
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,280
of the activity of this center.

314
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Beyond this lies another area which is a supraconscious

315
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,600
and then collective supraconscious meaning all that is the future.

316
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,440
So the people who are very futuristic,

317
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
very ambitious,

318
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,920
who try to dominate others

319
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,280
like Hitler you can call

320
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,520
would reside in that area of collective supraconscious.

321
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,640
In the center lies another power within us.

322
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,040
That's why Buddha always said keep to the center.

323
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,920
Live a life of moderation and not the extremes.

324
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,200
This central power is the power

325
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,560
that gives us our human awareness.

326
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,480
That carries us from a small little animal amoeba

327
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,200
to this stage of human level.

328
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,240
So it is our evolutionary power within us.

329
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,040
Scientists never thought on one point.

330
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,680
Why did we become human beings?

331
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,520
What was the need to make us human beings? For what purpose

332
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,240
nature if they don't believe in God has created human beings?

333
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:02,040
So this evolutionary powers work on a system called dharma

334
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,440
means the one that is sustained.

335
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,920
Also you can call the inner religion within us.

336
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,440
The religion of carbon is four valencies.

337
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,600
The carbon has four valencies

338
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,160
and the carbon stage resides on the first center in a human being

339
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,880
where carbon is a innocent thing.

340
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,480
All animals are innocent.

341
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
All matter is innocent.

342
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,560
If I put my hand in the fire it will burn.

343
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,600
If I don't put my hand there it will not burn. It is innocent.

344
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,440
Means it doesn't commit any sins because it has no concept of sin.

345
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,080
Only the human beings have got the concept of sin

346
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,560
through their ego and that's why they think they commit sins.

347
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,720
Till you are a human being

348
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,480
you'll always feel either you are committing sin

349
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,920
or you will think that others are committing sins.

350
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,760
Either you will aggress others

351
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,760
or you'll take aggression upon yourself.

352
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,760
So we have two types of people within us.

353
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,320
Specially the ones who take aggression,

354
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,320
the others who give aggression.

355
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,560
The left side people are the people who take aggression.

356
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,560
The right side people are the people who give aggression.

357
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,760
That doesn't mean the person who takes aggression is a very good man

358
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,360
or a person who gives aggression is a very bad man.

359
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,640
According to Me, both of them are in the same way.

360
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,040
Because if you trouble others you are aggressive.

361
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,360
But if you torture yourself you are aggressive to yourself.

362
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,680
And you have no business to torture yourself

363
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,480
because this body is not created by you.

364
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,760
It is created by God.

365
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,360
And this human being is created so beautifully with such love

366
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,360
by that creator for a purpose

367
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,360
and you have no business to destroy because of your ego

368
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,080
or because of your superego.

369
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,400
Now we have got two types of people

370
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,800
as I tell you the left and right side people.

371
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,720
And there are people who are very much in the center

372
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,400
who lead a life of moderation

373
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,120
of understanding

374
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,400
that life has to be worked out in a way that you get to God.

375
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,320
That you get to your Spirit.

376
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
They may not believe in God.

377
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,520
That's not necessary. They may not go to church.

378
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,400
They may not go to temples.

379
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,240
They may not do all these things but within themselves

380
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,080
they are people of moderation. They are good people.

381
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,600
They are righteous people.

382
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,440
They are people leading a good life

383
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,840
neither aggressing nor taking aggression.

384
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,080
They stand by those who are aggressed

385
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,240
and they [ABHOR or APPAL?] people who aggress.

386
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,240
And they tell the people who are aggressed

387
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
that you should not take any aggression.

388
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,680
These are the people who are in the center.

389
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,200
Now at this stage we have to combine these three types of people.

390
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
One is a tamo guni as they call it on the left hand side.

391
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,680
Right side is rajo guni.

392
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,800
And in the center is the person who stays as a [SATWA?] guni.

393
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,880
Now the central person

394
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,120
is very important from Sahaja Yoga point of view

395
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,640
because he gets his realization without any difficulty

396
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,080
and he achieves it, understands it, and accepts it

397
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,800
without any difficulty. Once it happens it just grows.

398
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,160
The people who are very complicated

399
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,960
either by over emotions or over mental activity

400
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,880
are the people who are to be brought round to the center.

401
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,480
And once their attention comes to the center

402
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,680
then it is much easier to enlighten them.

403
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,000
Now this kundalini which is the power within you of the Holy Ghost.

404
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,520
Holy Ghost is the power of God which is all pervading.

405
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,080
The power of God which is separated from God.

406
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,720
God Almighty the Father is watching the work of this

407
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,760
power which is His own.

408
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,640
Now you can see that this power of God is divided into four.

409
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,880
Three of them as I've told you. The fourth one is the kundalini.

410
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,400
The other day I told you kundalini is the pure desire within

411
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,480
which you may not be aware of.

412
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,040
Is the purest desire within you.

413
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,720
And this pure desire is to be one with the Divine.

414
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,640
And this desire is absolutely

415
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,280
waiting for a  moment when somebody could awaken it

416
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,480
and give the second birth to Her only child.

417
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,600
Everyone has an individual mother.

418
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,040
This kundalini looks after.

419
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,600
the one She give you conscience.

420
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,920
She's the one who guides you.

421
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,360
She's the one who saves you from difficult things.

422
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,040
She's the one who also nourishes your parasympathetic

423
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,640
which is in the center expressed in the center

424
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,600
which coordinates and controls the sympathetic nervous system

425
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
which are the left and right

426
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,320
sympathetic nervous system in the human body.

427
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,600
Now the doctors don't understand this

428
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,880
so they don't understand how to differentiate

429
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,320
between a psychosomatic problem,

430
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,040
between a physical problem,

431
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,120
between a mental problem,

432
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:55,440
and a problem that we can call of imbalances.

433
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,880
And in that confusion most of the diseases are

434
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,720
declared as incurable.

435
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,040
Now to understand how deep
all these problems are

436
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,960
one has to know that so far we have not reached the depth

437
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,400
where we could understand that

438
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,680
all the problems that we face in our society,

439
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
in our politics,

440
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,440
in our economics,

441
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,200
or in our day to day life,

442
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,440
in our family, with our children,

443
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,200
have got roots down below within ourselves

444
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,880
and if we could cure those roots

445
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,280
we can completely change the whole world.

446
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,200
The face of the whole world.

447
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,320
And emancipation of the whole mankind

448
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,600
is in the hands of today's people

449
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,320
who want first their correction of their instrument

450
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
and by that, correction of others.

451
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,880
This time has been described before as the resurrection time

452
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,320
by Muhammad.

453
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,760
the time of judgment by many others.

454
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,360
In the Bible it's described at the time of judgment.

455
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,200
In the Sistine Chapel if you have seen

456
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,640
the complete picture of the last judgment is so beautifully shown.

457
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,640
And the Agnya Chakra which is there

458
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,120
which is [PRESIDED or RESIDED?] by Christ Himself

459
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,960
is absolutely shown there.

460
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,280
Michelangelo himself was a realized soul

461
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
and he could see all these things so clearly.

462
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,240
put them down in beautiful pictures.

463
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,280
I wish you could have some chance to have a look at it

464
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,760
after your realization

465
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
and you will be surprised that he has shown

466
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,640
how Christ is going to choose ultimately.

467
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,120
Now at this time we have to see these three chakras

468
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,880
plus the three

469
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,000
channels that we have within ourselves.

470
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,040
So the combination of these we have to see how they work it out.

471
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,720
Now the first chakra if you notice is connected only to one side.

472
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,080
That is the psyche.

473
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,120
So when we start doing sex through our mental activity,

474
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,040
it is joyless.

475
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
It is out of place.

476
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,640
Reading about sex, thinking about sex,

477
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,440
working it out through sex understanding through brain

478
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,520
is absolutely useless because brain cannot understand sex.

479
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,280
We talk so much about sex but people have no joy of sex I can see

480
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,440
because if you really achieve the joy of sex within yourself,

481
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,480
after some time you just become above sex.

482
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,360
You mature into a personality where complete

483
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,640
freedom is there from sex for you.

484
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,920
You are completely potent.

485
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,960
You don't become impotent.

486
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,080
But the whole movement of your complete energy

487
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,800
goes towards your heart and not towards your sex.

488
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,240
This is another type of

489
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,200
world I come to sometimes in the West

490
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,640
where I'm surprised that people believe that sex plays a part

491
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,360
in their evolution.

492
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,200
In India nobody is going to believe this.

493
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,960
Even if you tell them Freud or anyone

494
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,360
they would say he must be mad.

495
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,080
They are not going to believe because traditionally

496
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,520
it is proved. See all traditional countries - China same.

497
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,880
I've talked to Egyptians, Chinese and Indians.

498
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,320
They have the same views about sex

499
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,400
and they just laugh at other people

500
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,080
what are they doing where are they rambling?

501
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,800
Why are you wasting their energy?

502
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
They just can't understand

503
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,720
what's the matter with these people have they gone off their heads.

504
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,600
But if you go to any newly born country

505
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,880
they are better

506
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,840
because also one reason

507
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,800
that sometimes tradition

508
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,480
can clamp you down to certain things which could not be so helpful.

509
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,880
But those who are [FAULT?] with their opinion even now

510
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,240
are better because you can tell them

511
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,680
that sex does not play part in your evolution.

512
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,680
Now you can see that it lies below the kundalini.

513
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,320
This center looks after all excretion

514
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,640
has got four petals

515
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,960
as we have got four plexuses, sub-plexuses.

516
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,000
We've got four sub-plexuses for our

517
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,560
major plexus called as pelvic plexus within us.

518
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,640
So in the gross the pelvic plexus

519
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,120
represents in the gross this subtle center of Mooladhara.

520
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,360
So the people who think too much about sex,

521
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,960
study sex,

522
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,080
and bother too much with their brains

523
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,480
are having a joyless pornography with them.

524
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,040
It's absolutely joyless, absurd

525
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,960
and creates the biggest problem for the society.

526
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,200
First time when I went abroad

527
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
abroad I [STARTED?] people looking at every woman

528
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,240
looking at every man.

529
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,920
Mad I'm seeing what's the matter with them.

530
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,440
Very unsteady temperament.

531
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,880
You know all the time looking at every woman

532
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,160
looking at every man.

533
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,200
You can't miss one.

534
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,560
You see, even if there is a lady [UNCLEAR] going  on

535
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,720
twisting your neck up to that and another falls down.

536
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,840
And then you say you have missed someone.

537
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,240
There we should keep looking.

538
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,960
And like mad you know all of them are going

539
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,880
I said, "What's the matter?"

540
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,440
Whether they are eighty year old,

541
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,240
six year old, or ten year old, or even

542
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,360
they are absolutely about to jump in the grave.

543
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
Still in the grave they might be twisting their heads.

544
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,440
It's stupid and it's stupidity.

545
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,320
What do we get out of it?

546
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,800
But the eyes are so now weak

547
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,360
because after Sahaja Yoga when they come to me

548
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,520
they tell Me, "Mother even now we cannot fix our eyes."

549
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,040
There's something.

550
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,560
Once one of the sahaja yogi was standing next to me.

551
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,960
Suddenly he turned his head.

552
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,240
I said, "What happened?"

553
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,160
He said, "There's a lady standing behind me."

554
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,600
So I said, "How is it you've got attracted to her?"

555
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,280
There must be some sort of a

556
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,320
thing behind your head and that's what it is here.

557
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,240
That the Mooladhara is expressed at the back

558
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,080
here in the point which is jutting out of your

559
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,040
brain and bones. That's the point is of Mooladhara.

560
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,800
how it has an effect on the eyes. Because it goes on wobbling.

561
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,520
There are two types of effects of Mooladhara

562
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,400
One is the right side another left side.

563
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,240
If you are too much constipated person

564
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,880
if you suffer from too much constipation

565
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,440
you are a very strict man.

566
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,520
Even you would not look at your wife, that sort of a person.

567
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,720
There are that another extremes are there.

568
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,720
A nun or a priest or some sort of thing like that.

569
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,840
Just forced celibacy

570
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,800
and a very disciplined life. Such people can get Right Mooladhara.

571
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,760
The Left Mooladhara - those people get it who are

572
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,840
not at all have any respect for their chastity at all.

573
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,560
These are the two types of extreme you go

574
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,720
because of the left and the right.

575
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,160
But the left side

576
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,880
Mooladhara is much more dangerous than the right side.

577
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,440
Because at the most a person can get constipation or trouble of

578
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,880
all these dryness in the body from the right side.

579
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,600
But the left side Mooladhara

580
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,320
those who indiscriminately use their chakras

581
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,120
for a very licentious, permissive life and all that

582
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,240
go into dangerous zones.

583
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,800
Already nature has already shown that.

584
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,480
Nature shows that.

585
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,120
Sixty-five percent of young people in America are

586
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:17,360
either impotent or are suffering from a terrible

587
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,320
[INFLUX or INFLUENCE?] absolute horrible diseases which cannot be cured.

588
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,920
You must be knowing that sailors when they travel

589
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,360
they have to take an injection at every port.

590
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,200
Because they are supposed to indulge into that

591
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,720
but these days it is democracy so everybody is the same.

592
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,960
"Demonocracy" I will call it.

593
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,760
"Because the kings were like this,

594
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,840
we should be. Why, what's wrong?"

595
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,400
But you'll be amazed if this center is spoiled

596
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,120
what diseases you can get is one of them is this mellitus.

597
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,520
Not only but if a person has this disease

598
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,160
any woman or man who lives with such a person

599
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,320
can contact horrible diseases at that point because of this center.

600
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,240
That's why Christ has said that, "It is written in The Bible,

601
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,920
'Thou shall not commit adultery.'"

602
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,440
I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

603
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,480
To that extent He went.

604
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,720
The purity of eyes is lost.

605
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,080
And that's what He

606
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,480
pointed out for today's time at this time that this will happen.

607
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,680
So it creates so many problems in the married life itself.

608
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,680
Now we see the combination how it works.

609
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,120
If you are a left sided sexual pervert

610
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,960
you get into all kinds of nonsense.

611
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,480
First of all you develop

612
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,040
funny relationships which I can't understand.

613
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,640
All sorts of funny relations.

614
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,520
I was told yesterday there was some

615
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,960
homosexual who had some to fight Me

616
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,600
but I never mentioned anything about sex so then he ran away.

617
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,000
But it is a joyless sex habit.

618
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
It is joyless.

619
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,760
Apart from that it is unnatural.

620
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,800
It gives problem to both of them

621
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,760
and they are in for a trouble

622
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,880
for a very serious disease within ten years all of them will suffer

623
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,800
from either cancer or from mellitus. Take it from Me.

624
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,480
Within ten years time.

625
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,160
Let them fight, go to the courts, get their rights to become [SAME or SIN?. -ed I think same].

626
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,680
I have nothing to say.

627
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,640
They are all going to suffer too much.

628
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,400
It's like you're going to the government and asking for right

629
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,880
for getting yourself into disease or into madness.

630
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,920
They'll become mad

631
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,600
because if this center goes out here you become mad.

632
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,880
You become a mad person.

633
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,560
You become a crazy person.

634
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,160
No wonder that

635
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:21,000
you find more crazy persons in the west than in India.

636
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,960
We may be poor people. At least we have some wisdom.

637
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,160
We have traditionally known that this is what happens.

638
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,960
I just can't understand how people take to these things so easily

639
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,160
and ask for it and go into troubles.

640
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,080
So all these diseases like mellitus even cancer,

641
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,880
cancer of the lower region.

642
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,080
All these can be caused by these perverted people.

643
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,200
Apart from this perversion

644
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,800
too much indulgences into all sorts of women

645
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,960
and all sorts of prostitution and licentiousness is decadence.

646
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,040
Is complete decadence of the society.

647
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,600
How do we expect to have good children?

648
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,840
How do you expect to have good relationship with your wife?

649
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,080
In your family you have no nest there.

650
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,200
You'll live with the [WILD WIND?].

651
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,880
Like the [WILD WIND?] yourself.

652
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,400
Imagine in India when they say that,

653
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,880
"All right. If you have a person a stranger who comes to your house

654
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,960
be careful. He might run away with your things."

655
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,120
All right doesn't matter.

656
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,480
But now in England, Indians say, "Don't allow any

657
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,240
Westerner to come and stay in your house.

658
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,880
He'll run away with your wife."

659
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,480
I mean they remove the roots of the family absolutely.

660
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,520
You go in a society. I find

661
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,560
all the women and men are so upset

662
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,640
or aggressive because they feel insecure.

663
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,960
So insecure with each other.

664
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,840
They don't know what are these women are up to.

665
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,280
The woman doesn't know what the man is up to.

666
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,920
They are so insecure.

667
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,960
If you travel abroad you meet somebody

668
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,920
she say things like, "Of course my husband is not going to be

669
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,640
a very good man, why should I be a good lady?

670
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,520
Why should I be a good lady?

671
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,960
If that my husband is not going to do that

672
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,160
then why should I try to be a good person?"

673
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,360
And the competition sets in in them.

674
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,280
All sorts of funny things are going on in the name of enjoyment.

675
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,400
This is the most joyless enterprise you are into.

676
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,520
A man comes home.

677
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,120
I saw this in England first time and I was shocked.

678
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,600
We're living in an area which is really of very elite

679
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,640
lords and ladies live there.

680
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,640
And we had a neighbor about

681
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,320
say forty-eight years of age or something.

682
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,800
And her son who was living in a hostel brought another friend

683
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,840
who was much younger to him.

684
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,800
And this lady eloped with him.

685
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,680
Stupid I tell you it is stupidity this old woman.

686
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,440
They sold the house because she has a right.

687
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,400
Even your laws must understand what they are doing.

688
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,640
She sold the house. They had three daughters.

689
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,560
Three daughters are on the street like prostitutes now.

690
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,720
Father has no control.

691
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,240
He has so called married another woman.

692
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,400
It's absurd.

693
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,080
This is not the way the society is going to work out.

694
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,920
There's something definitely very wrong with us

695
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,440
because we do not understand that chastity

696
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,200
is the greatest thing a human being can have.

697
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,240
It's the power that a man has is of his chastity

698
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,680
and a woman has.

699
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,720
People ask me about Mahatma Gandhi.

700
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,440
I mean he was a man who was so chaste, his wife so chaste.

701
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,360
I mean we have had many people like that India

702
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,880
except for the city people are different.

703
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,120
But in the villages they don't think

704
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,880
of these things, and they live very normally.

705
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,160
While it's such a kind of a

706
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,920
inferiority complex put into everyone.

707
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,560
a sign of inferiority complex only

708
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,800
that you want to attract every man and woman on the street.

709
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,560
If you are really good

710
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,480
why should you worry about attracting everyone you see?

711
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,120
And advertising.

712
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Another thing is that, people think that

713
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,080
when a lady is good looking you must have her.

714
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,520
This is absurd again.

715
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,720
How are you looking? Please see in the mirror.

716
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,840
Why every man wants a beautiful woman

717
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,520
and why every beautiful woman wants a beautiful man?

718
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,000
I can't understand.

719
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,760
But then only two, three persons can marry in this world.

720
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,800
Because the others are just looking at them flabbergasted.

721
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
But what you have why don't you enjoy?

722
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,360
A simple thing as that.

723
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,360
You have your wife. You have your husband.

724
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,600
Why not enjoy them?

725
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,240
Want to enjoy somebody else's wife?

726
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,680
Thou shall not covet your neighbor's wife.

727
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,480
This behavior is to be changed

728
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,400
But you cannot change it overnight. I understand that.

729
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,480
Only way is that you must ascend.

730
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,120
When you become the Spirit there is second birth

731
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,040
everything is washed off.

732
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,240
I've seen many homosexuals - they can become sensible.

733
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,200
Many prostitutes have become very sensible women.

734
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,240
But that's what happened to Mary Magdalene

735
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,240
when she came to Christ.

736
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,640
This is what the purity has to do is to purify you

737
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,280
and to give you the maximum joy of life.

738
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,200
From married life you have no joy.

739
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,080
You are all the time fighting on something,

740
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,080
on material things, on this and that and that.

741
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,760
But if that innate understanding between both of them is made.

742
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,560
Only the people who take maybe those drugs

743
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,440
may not be fighting because they have become cabbages now.

744
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,120
If you have no power to fight and if you don't fight,

745
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,120
what is so great?

746
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:41,080
To substantiate your society with real source of joy

747
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,920
you must establish this center

748
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,800
which Australians can do much faster than anybody else

749
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,080
because now I have got disciples from twelve countries

750
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,680
and the best among them on this point are Australians.

751
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:01,400
Overnight they are changed people. Overnight. Wonderful people.

752
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,040
But to a western mind it's not a serious thing

753
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,160
because they cannot locate it.

754
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,120
They cannot relate it to the disease that is causing it.

755
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,680
It's so such an open truth that

756
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,160
people who indulge into these bad habits develop

757
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,520
very bad diseases

758
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,760
even some of the leprosies among the kind of leprosies

759
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,200
are developed by that.

760
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,520
But the modern diseases are even worse.

761
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,320
I met a gentleman who has mellitus.

762
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,280
And his wife was a mad woman.

763
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,840
But he liked her despite her madness and all that.

764
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,960
He should have put her in a lunatic asylum.

765
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,640
And he developed this from the Left Mooladhara.

766
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,640
Now to cure these people is very easy.

767
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,480
You have to just raise the kundalini

768
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,760
and the kundalini can enlighten that center

769
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,360
and your innocence can come back.

770
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,680
Your chastity will show its result.

771
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,640
Your face will change.

772
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,320
People I have seen after realization become twenty years younger

773
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,160
immediately

774
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,960
because of this center

775
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,680
which is bestowed upon by the deity of Shri Ganesha

776
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,960
who is the embodiment of eternal childhood.

777
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,800
And this Shri Ganesha later on takes His birth

778
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,440
at the higher chakra called Agnya

779
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,720
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

780
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,960
That I'll tell you tomorrow about Jesus Christ who He was,

781
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,520
how He came on this Earth

782
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,600
and what are the reference to Him

783
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,080
in the ancient scriptures of India.

784
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,480
So the center of Mooladhara - the lesser the better.

785
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,800
I think it is for you to understand

786
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,120
that chastity plays a very important part.

787
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,320
If the person has got this problem

788
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,600
then the kundalini does rise no doubt.

789
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,480
It rises but is again sucked back.

790
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,440
Even the people who are too much on the right hand side

791
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,560
always think too much and work very hard

792
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,480
and earning money for their wives find their wives run away.

793
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,000
Because they are very hard people to live with.

794
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,960
They are very hot tempered, irritable, and aggressive.

795
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,560
So here the man earns everything for the wife

796
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,880
and there he finds the wife has run away by the time he comes home.

797
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,720
So this chakra is the basis of our lives.

798
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,520
Chastity is the basis of our life.

799
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,560
You must have heard that women in India - thousands of them

800
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,840
put up a pyre and burnt themselves off

801
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,240
called as [JEOPARD?]

802
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,320
because they thought that the Muslim invaders will come

803
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,800
and molest their chastity.

804
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,480
Because traditionally they have realized that chastity

805
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,280
is the power of a woman.

806
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,760
Same of the man.

807
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,120
Of course men don't believe in chastity at all.

808
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,720
You see, they think they are not men if they are chaste.

809
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,800
such a man who has no chastity is not at all a man.

810
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,040
Not at all a man. He's something in between.

811
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,440
Anyone who has chastity

812
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,040
chastity can see from the way he talks with his confidence with his

813
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,920
complete understanding of the whole thing.

814
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,760
Such person surpasses everybody else.

815
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,080
And even after the death of such a licentious man

816
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,960
he may be the biggest man, people talk about him.

817
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,040
You cannot adore a man of that kind.

818
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,200

819
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,920
"Oh it's all right he was great

820
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,120
but he had this nonsense business with him.

821
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,800
He was going about with such and such actress."

822
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,320
You don't respect such a man because I have not seen anyone

823
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,360
putting up statues of people who were great because of

824
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,160
their unchaste behavior. I haven't seen anyone.

825
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,600
Or because he was a great homosexual you put up a

826
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,240
big statue of him. A great homosexual.

827
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,360
I mean you may do it later on.

828
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,920
I don't know to what extent one can go

829
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,120
with this madness what wrong

830
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,640
I have not seen anyone  putting up a perverted man.

831
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,640
All right put a statue of him and garland him.

832
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,760
I've not seen even the silliest of silly respecting such a people.

833
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,280
There's a clan in India called as

834
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,360
[ZARCOMES?]. They are of a right type.

835
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,120
They too worship a goddess who is a very strict goddess.

836
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,160
They too want to ask her for blessing that they should not

837
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,840
be like this in next life whatever they have done in previous life.

838
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,200
That's why they have become like this.

839
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,600
Now next life at least should be good.

840
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,960
So they try to worship a goddess which is a very strict goddess.

841
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,480
They give all punishments to us but don't give us this life.

842
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,400
So this is the basis that we have

843
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,760
and we have to ascend to the spirit.

844
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,080
Now the another chakra we have is the Swadhisthana Chakra.

845
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,640
As you can see that it is connected to the right side.

846
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,080
But it moves to the right and left.

847
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,360
It is like a lotus with a stem

848
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,720
which moves in that area that is shown the green part

849
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,760
which is [UNCLEAR].

850
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,680
And here the attention resides.

851
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,920
Human attention resides here.

852
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,280
This center comes out of the third center which you see there

853
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,880
as the green one

854
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:22,080
called as the center of your seeking.

855
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,600
The first one I told you is the center of innocence.

856
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,240
The second one of creativity.

857
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,000
And the third one of seeking.

858
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,720
This is the most important center

859
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,200
within us because of seeking we have become human beings.

860
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,960
First we were seeking

861
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:53,400
only food, then a shelter, then a society.

862
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,400
Then of course money, possessions, politics, power.

863
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,520
Ultimately you become subtler and subtler because

864
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,680
is trial and error method.

865
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,680
You try this. Get fed up.

866
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,320
Next life you come you become something else.

867
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,200
That life you try something. You become something else.

868
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,880
That's how the human beings work it out

869
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,320
ultimately come to a point that there is no sense in all these

870
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,440
pursuits. Forget it.

871
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,840
There must be something beyond

872
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:29,280
and that's the real place where you have to arrive.

873
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,200
That it is the Spirit we are seeking.

874
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,400
In all these things there was nothing but a just a mirage

875
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,840
of joy.

876
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,960
There is no joy in all these things

877
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,440
so we should give up this mirage and take to reality.

878
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,160
That is the Spirit within us.

879
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,480
In this seeking we have two types of people again

880
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,800
the left sided and the right sided.

881
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,960
The left sided people think that

882
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,120
if they have their own family - mostly Indians are like that.

883
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,040
They believe in the family system to such an extent

884
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,120
that they can sell their country sometimes

885
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,560
for their own children's sake, for their sons.

886
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,120
Thus, they have no sense of collectivity in them.

887
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,000
When it comes to such a

888
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,200
close [UNCLEAR] feeling for your own family

889
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,120
that if your son - even if he's a murderer

890
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,760
still he's your own son.

891
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,840
So in relation to the whole you must think of your family.

892
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,200
The left sided people can be also extremely emotional type.

893
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,360
So all their creativity goes to the emotional side

894
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,960
like they become poets

895
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,160
sing the song of [LAMENTATION?],

896
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:47,720
anguish, sufferings, all kinds of sufferings they have.

897
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,280
This is not a very kind thing to do

898
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,960
to make others cry you see.

899
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,800
There are some poets who make you so much cry

900
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,880
that they'll take out your eyes and wash it and put it back.

901
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,520
To that extent they are horribly sadistic

902
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,760
like Lord Byron, horrible fellow.

903
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,200
He wrote this so many things.

904
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:11,440
He himself led a most licentious and a horrid life.

905
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,680
He was an aggressive man.

906
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,120
He did all that to aggress others, torture others.

907
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:24,400
And here he's writing the poetry of how man suffers.

908
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,560
Just imagine

909
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,240
what a dishonest and a cheat he was to talk like this.

910
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,680
He was such an arrogant man

911
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,600
that he went to Portugal.

912
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,280
There's a beautiful place called Sintra there.

913
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,200
Beautiful place.

914
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,920
So he says that

915
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,840
Sintra is too beautiful to be wasted on Portuguese.

916
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,280
As if he is the most beautiful man ever,

917
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,640
meaning that all this beauty should flow to this horrible person.

918
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,120
This creates an imaginary you see

919
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,760
an [UNCLEAR] to suffer.

920
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,480
I've met many like that.

921
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,560
They are poetically suffering. See.

922
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,520
They enjoy all the songs of suffering

923
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,520
and then they become themselves tragic.

924
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,520
Such people cannot give joy to anyone.

925
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,440
I mean people run away

926
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,960
from such people. They think he is a person who is a mourner.

927
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,920
In India you see we pay these mourners.

928
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,440
If somebody dies and has no mourners they can be paid.

929
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,640
And they are brought for crying and weeping

930
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,360
and saying all these things you see

931
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,600
there are people paid for it in India. Imagine.

932
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,120
I mean we use them for  this purpose.

933
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,960
Artificially they can mourn somebody's death

934
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,400
and earn some money out of it.

935
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,600
But such kind of miserable people

936
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,640
are such a

937
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
blot on the name of God

938
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,440
who has given you so much.

939
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,720
Count your blessings.

940
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,280
Count your blessings one by one.

941
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,480
First of all that

942
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,080
you are not under the control of the nature, the parsha.

943
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,080
You are a free human being.

944
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,080
So many things He has given you

945
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,280
and still you are weeping and crying

946
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,000
and saying that we have to suffer.

947
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,560
who believe in suffering will get it.

948
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,480
You want suffering? Then have it.

949
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,480
They get it.

950
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,720
And these people can really go so much with it

951
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,560
about the suffering part

952
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,960
that recently I met one group in Spain.

953
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,120
And I said, "What are you doing about your seeking?"

954
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,160
They said, "We are going to Gobi Desert."

955
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,560
I said, "For what?"

956
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,200
"There's the Shambhala is there."

957
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,760
I said, "What is that Shambhala?"

958
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,160
"It's the God's heaven in Gobi Desert. And there's a gentleman

959
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,920
who is going to take us to the Gobi Desert

960
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,640
and we are going to walk in the center of Gobi Desert."

961
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,720
I said, "Very nice."

962
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,360
"And we are paying so much money for that."

963
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,040
Now in that Gobi desert

964
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,640
you can't get even a drop of water.

965
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,880
You pay lot of money

966
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,640
to go to that Gobi Desert,

967
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,600
walk across, and die there.

968
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,760
And this man gets all the money you know befooling [HERE?].

969
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,480
"But then we must suffer."

970
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,520
For what?

971
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,720
Why you want to suffer?

972
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,160
Christ has suffered for you enough.

973
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,280
If Christ is awakened within you

974
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,520
He will take up everything upon Himself.

975
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,360
He'll really wash all your sins

976
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,680
and you can get your realization.

977
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,120
That's how it works so quick.

978
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,160
If you know how to enlightened Him within yourself

979
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,920
then it works out.

980
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:46,400
Still the Christians are even continuing with ideas

981
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,760
leave alone the Jews.

982
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,600
Christians are just the same.

983
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,480
And they enjoy you see this kind of suffering upon themselves.

984
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,840
Is all imaginary.

985
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,560
Like we went to France in Paris.

986
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,960
"We are all miserable people le miserable."

987
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,320
And they told Me,

988
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
"Don't tell them Mother that you are happy, you know.

989
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,800
They'll not like it.

990
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,960
You better tell that you are the most miserable."

991
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,040
Le miserable.

992
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,600
All miserables sitting there.

993
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,960
I said, "What miserable they are."

994
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,760
Every third lamppost you'll find a pub

995
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,480
and every seventh lamppost you'll find a prostitute.

996
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,960
This is the miserable thing they have.

997
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,640
Do miserable people do all these things?

998
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,400
Just sitting outside for the last doomsday,

999
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,800
the calamity. They'll have it

1000
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,400
if they want to have it.

1001
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,320
But God has not created you to be miserable at all.

1002
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,720
No, not at all.

1003
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,400
He has created you to be very happy and joyous

1004
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,440
to enjoy the beauties of His bounties.

1005
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,720
We are really letting Him down

1006
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,400
and it's really such a miserable thing. Supposing now

1007
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,400
you want to invite somebody to your house.

1008
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,600
Your own son is coming. You are so excited about him.

1009
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,800
You are so anxious that your son after such a long time

1010
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,480
such a long journey

1011
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,200
is coming as a glorious man to your house

1012
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,560
and then he's weeping saying, "I'm miserable."

1013
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:26,080
So those people who indulge into the left side of the Swadhisthana

1014
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,880
so much

1015
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,960
suffer

1016
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,880
because they enter into an area called

1017
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,600
collective subconscious

1018
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,200
and this is the area which the other day doctors pointed out.

1019
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,960
they were studied the cancer disease they said

1020
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,760
a vulnerable person who is vulnerable to cancer

1021
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,120
the one who's an extreme temperament person.

1022
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,440
A person who is extremely hard working can be vulnerable also.

1023
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,880
But is triggered, is triggered by

1024
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,440
a protein which they call as protein 58

1025
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,760
or protein 52

1026
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,320
which enters into the being,

1027
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:12,360
which triggers it, and this protein one

1028
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,440
is coming from the area called as

1029
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,480
according to them we call it

1030
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,080
collective conscious. Collective subconscious.

1031
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:26,200
But they call it the area built in within us since the creation.

1032
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:31,200
I mean they say something else. We make it clearer that's all.

1033
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,120
And cancer is caused by that.

1034
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,720
Invariably I have seen those people who have come to Me from cancer

1035
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,560
have been the people who got it from left side.

1036
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,640
You wanted to suffer? All right have cancer. Enjoy it.

1037
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,800
But there was a journalist who came to see Me in America

1038
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,960
and I told him that you should not suffer.

1039
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,080
So he folded everything. He said, "I'm going back".

1040
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,920
He said, "It is my right to suffer."

1041
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,080
Imagine. I said, "Now what to say to this man?"

1042
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,560
I said, "All right then go ahead with it.

1043
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
When you are fed up with it you come to Me.

1044
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,680
But just now you have a right to suffer. Do what you like."

1045
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,120
If somebody wants to hit himself

1046
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,880
with a bamboo or something

1047
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,320
and you say, "Why do you want to hit yourself?"

1048
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,200
Say, "It's a right, my right to hit myself."

1049
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,000
I said, "All right hit." But you have no right

1050
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
because you cannot create yourself.

1051
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,920
You have no right to torture yourself.

1052
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,120
You have no right to make yourself miserable.

1053
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,320
You have to make yourself happy people,

1054
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,960
joyous people,

1055
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,160
blissful people so that God feels

1056
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,120
you have received blessings.

1057
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,280
That He may be placed

1058
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:56,240
through His own creation that is the epitome, the human beings.

1059
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,080
That's the best way you should please God by saying,

1060
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,760
"Father we are very happy people.

1061
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,200
Don't worry about us. We are so thankful to You."

1062
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,800
So that's how the joy killers come to us from the left side.

1063
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,320
The right side is the people who kill others' joy.

1064
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,800
Spoil sports as you call them in a very mild way.

1065
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,960
They are the ones who are aggressive.

1066
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,200
They cannot see anybody being peaceful.

1067
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,760
Even countries can be like that.

1068
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,440
Collectively they can do like this.

1069
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,600
If they see any country is peaceful, they'll attack.

1070
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,360
"Why is he peaceful?

1071
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,640
We must attack and capture that country."

1072
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:44,040
The people who cannot bear the joy of other people

1073
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,360
become aggressive and try to aggress them.

1074
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,760
There are people who just get sometimes jealous.

1075
01:13:55,240 --> 01:14:00,440
Sometimes just for aggression they become aggressive.

1076
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,920
I have no reason sometimes

1077
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,120
the way people suddenly shoot up like Jack in the Box

1078
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,960
and start talking in such an aggressive manner

1079
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,640
you don't understand why should we aggress.

1080
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,280
is no need to aggress at all.

1081
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,320
But they go on aggressing people.

1082
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,600
Then they may form

1083
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,080
a thing like as a German state

1084
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,840
that we are a superior race, a sense of superiority.

1085
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:29,960
All your racialism comes from this nonsense of a aggression.

1086
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,120
I mean I can't understand Western people.

1087
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:39,280
For example they're so particular about their race being preserved

1088
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,600
because they think they are white skin.

1089
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,200
But they go to the sea, make it black. Why?

1090
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:49,240
I mean either you are white skin or you have black. One of the two.

1091
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,320
So they are so confused.

1092
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,960
They think they are not beautiful

1093
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,840
because they are white skin, light skin.

1094
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,960
So if you are not so beautiful

1095
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,440
then why do you think you are above the world?

1096
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,680
Racialism is something so much

1097
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,760
a mental projection, absolutely a mental projection

1098
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,360
and with this mental projection we gather so much of

1099
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,920
curses of [THE OTHER WORLD?].

1100
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,320
I'll give you an example. We went to China.

1101
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,680
And Chinese are so much against British I was surprised.

1102
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,280
So much against. The worst are British according to them.

1103
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,920
They had seven aggressors.

1104
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,520
I said, "Why?"

1105
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,960
Because they gave them dopes you see.

1106
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,600
And if you ask the British of that time they will say that,

1107
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,840
"Because they deserved it.

1108
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,880
We gave them. See, what's wrong?"

1109
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,560
But when I told them that

1110
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,240
Britishers are taking drugs and all that. "Nice for them.

1111
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,080
Let them all take it.

1112
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,240
That's what they deserve.

1113
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,920
They're drunkards. Let them have the drugs."

1114
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,600
Nobody will have the sympathy with people who are aggressors.

1115
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,120
If you think you are a great [RACE?], go ahead with it.

1116
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,480
And the more [RACE?] is going toward the doom.

1117
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,240
You must know you must learn from others also.

1118
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,920
People have learned from you politics, economics.

1119
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,560
I don't know what you've made out of it.

1120
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,320
If you think you have done very good, well,

1121
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,080
I have nothing to say.

1122
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,840
Also other things they have learned from you.

1123
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:23,240
English language I have learned.

1124
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,840
And why do you call everybody a lower

1125
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,800
developed thing? You are a developed country.

1126
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,160
What have you developed?

1127
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,840
Atom bombs to kill yourself?

1128
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,880
What have you developed?

1129
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,760
All kinds of aggressiveness.

1130
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,440
You go to other country with a Bible in the hand and another

1131
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,440
a pistol in the your hand or a rifle in your hand to kill others.

1132
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,440
This aggression comes from mental projection that we have

1133
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,120
that we are great you see puffed up.

1134
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,600
The best for that is Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

1135
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,000
That's the one it is.

1136
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,760
Is that the Humpty Dumpty's.

1137
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,400
I tell you all [RIGHTS? HEIGHTS?].

1138
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,120
All [RIGHTS? HEIGHTS?] are so sensible.

1139
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,560
And they said the Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall

1140
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,720
and Humpty Dumpty had a big fall.

1141
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,880
And all the king's horses and men could not put them together again.

1142
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,040
That's what it is a Humpty Dumpty a big ego like a balloon.

1143
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,360
They'll float like as if something

1144
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,280
you see like angels in the world

1145
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,720
while when they'll reach

1146
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,880
the kingdom of God, God will say, "What business you had to hate

1147
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,040
any part of this creation.

1148
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,720
Who are you I don't know."

1149
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,040
Because in collectivity you are so poor in this respect.

1150
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,680
So we have to understand

1151
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,880
that God has created all of us.

1152
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,360
We have to have variety.

1153
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,200
It looks nice

1154
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,640
that you wear another dress. I wear another dress.

1155
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,840
I have another face. You have another face.

1156
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,960
Unless and until there are variety in the nature

1157
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,800
it doesn't look nice. You'll be bored stiff.

1158
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,160
I mean people get bored stiff I tell you

1159
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,000
when I've seen these people when they come to India

1160
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:58,960
they want to go to villages

1161
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:02,560
because in the city they said there are many white skin people.

1162
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,520
You want to see something else than this.

1163
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,640
This variety is an important of the beauty that God has created

1164
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,240
out of which if you think the white skin is higher.

1165
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,600
Tomorrow the black skin people will say the black skin is higher.

1166
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,480
Possibly.

1167
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,640
But the another thing is working out is this

1168
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,720
very subtle which you do not understand.

1169
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,120
The people whom you have aggressed are

1170
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,120
crawling into your young people.

1171
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,640
They are the one who are aggressing you now

1172
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,440
as gurus

1173
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,960
draining out your money in a very subtle way.

1174
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,560
They are dominating all your young generation

1175
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,400
which is tomorrow's nation.

1176
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,200
They are giving them drugs and things and they are just making them

1177
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,040
into cabbages

1178
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,800
a very subtle way

1179
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,880
because they are left sided people they know how to do it.

1180
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,080
The aggression is not apparent. The aggression is at least better

1181
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,720
better that you can see it apparently

1182
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:09,400
but this is a very subtle aggression that is crawling in.

1183
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,960
And it's going into your minds working here,

1184
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:18,640
and you are losing contact with yourself.

1185
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,680
Every action has a reaction but this reaction is very wrong for me

1186
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:27,000
because I have come at a time when thousands of my

1187
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,800
children, the seekers of God have been born.

1188
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,600
This is the time when they have to got their realization

1189
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,360
and at this time these people are so powerful because

1190
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,720
of your fear now.

1191
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,040
The person who aggresses also has a fear.

1192
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,880
The children might develop a fear that we should not aggress.

1193
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:51,360
And they become so mild that they take aggression from others.

1194
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,760
And that's what is happening to your children

1195
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,280
when your grandparents aggressed others.

1196
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,680
They now want to take all the aggression from the other.

1197
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,480
That is also a wrong thing.

1198
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:06,840
So this is what is happening to our society today.

1199
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,640
I would say to sum it

1200
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:13,680
we'll say that the people in the West

1201
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,400
are committing a sin against the Mother

1202
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,080
and in the East in India against the Father.

1203
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,960
And how they commit that I'll tell you in the third center.

1204
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,760
The third center is of the seeking.

1205
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:33,760
The third center that belongs to the seeking

1206
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,560
a very important one

1207
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,520
because it gives you seeking in all kinds of things.

1208
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,080
Money

1209
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,880
power

1210
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,080
love

1211
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,320
and ultimately God.

1212
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:55,680
Now when you are going against

1213
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,440
the current of a [UNCLEAR]

1214
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,720
sideways if you are moving

1215
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:04,120
then the problems are created.

1216
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,480
That people who are seeking power outside

1217
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:12,600
must know that the power lies within yourself.

1218
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,840
As I told someone the other day

1219
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,480
that I am the greatest capitalist and the greatest communist

1220
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,440
because I have all the powers within Myself

1221
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:25,960
and I cannot live without sharing it with others.

1222
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,960
I am a very happily married woman.

1223
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,760
I have a very nice family.

1224
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,240
Everything I have in life

1225
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,600
that one could think to be a very successfully married woman.

1226
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,920
That's what I am.

1227
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,360
But I can't

1228
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,320
enjoy anything without sharing this inner joy with you all.

1229
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:51,120
This is the real politics of God.

1230
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:56,040
Not an artificial politics where we believe

1231
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,040
in communism, but in heart we are capitalist.

1232
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,120
And while we believe in capitalism, in heart we are communist.

1233
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,880
We are suffering because of that.

1234
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,200
There's no integration.

1235
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,960
All this what you see artificially

1236
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,960
is all real there because whatever is artificial

1237
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,120
comes from some real source.

1238
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,360
If there is one artificial flower means there are

1239
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,640
real flowers and

1240
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,320
you can create many artificial flowers

1241
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,360
but it has to have some background.

1242
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,600
All these ideas that human beings have about economics also

1243
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,040
is very artificial to possess things

1244
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,520
to possess many things.

1245
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:44,960
To possess human beings also is there, possessiveness.

1246
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,880
But you must know possession is the greatest headache.

1247
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:51,680
Logically you can understand.

1248
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,240
I don't possess this instrument, thank God.

1249
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,560
So I'm not worried about it. I'm using it nicely

1250
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,800
because it is higher or whatever it is.

1251
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,920
It's not mine. I am not to be [UNCLEAR].

1252
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,760
Otherwise I'll have to insure it.

1253
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,600
I'll have to look after it. Big headache.

1254
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,960
It's better to see other people,

1255
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,480
other people's palaces than to have for yourself.

1256
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,760
It's a headache you see.

1257
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,920
The owner of the palace if you go and see

1258
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,280
has all the wrinkles which you can count one by one.

1259
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,560
A very sad man sitting there miserable

1260
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,000
and they point it out he's the owner of this palace

1261
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,800
while others who are seeing it are enjoying it

1262
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,720
and the fellow is sitting miserable

1263
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,200
because he has problems of duty

1264
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,080
he has problem of income tax,

1265
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,160
he has problem of how to maintain it.

1266
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,880
But you don't possess anything. It's a myth.

1267
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,080
It's a myth.

1268
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,600
We don't take anything with us.

1269
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,840
Only we take our realization.

1270
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,040
But it's not a mental thing, that I can tell you.

1271
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,880
You cannot detach yourself for any one of these things

1272
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,880
unless and until you get your realization

1273
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,240
because attachment is there

1274
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,280
as a result of ignorance.

1275
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,560
Unless and until there is light

1276
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,440
you cannot give up.

1277
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,240
Mentally you cannot do it.

1278
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,880
But the possessiveness on India is that

1279
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,400
they think they should somehow hook or crook make money.

1280
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,160
Not all, but many.

1281
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,680
At least the people at the helm of affairs feel like that.

1282
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,640
That means they have no faith in God.

1283
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,800
Shri Krishna has said, "Yogakshemam vahamyaham."

1284
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,760
When you will get your yoga

1285
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,160
when you'll get your union

1286
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,680
I'll look after your kshema, means your wellbeing.

1287
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,960
Shri Krishna was in India

1288
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,520
and this is what India believe in.

1289
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:44,680
When God is going to look after us when we get yoga,

1290
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,600
why not get to yoga straightforward?

1291
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,560
I could understand that we had to fight for our freedom.

1292
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,520
That's all right.

1293
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,640
But after that fight

1294
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,760
now what do you have to have is yoga.

1295
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,280
First take to your yoga and He looks after you

1296
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,440
because this is the principle of wealth also

1297
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,880
of your wellbeing.

1298
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,080
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga

1299
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,960
somehow get their debts paid.

1300
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,120
They get out of all the financial entanglements.

1301
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,560
They get sufficient money to live well

1302
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,040
but not too much because that's an extreme.

1303
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,680
They live gloriously.

1304
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,600
They become generous people.

1305
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,720
Despite affluence I find people have no sense of generosity.

1306
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,880
They are saving money.

1307
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,240
Morning till evening saving so many pounds.

1308
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,960
Spend so much save so much.

1309
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,720
The advertisement goes like that.

1310
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,000
We spend so much and you save so much,

1311
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,520
and people are looking out for us how they can save money.

1312
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,240
Save for what?

1313
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,200
For what?

1314
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,440
To go to a pub?

1315
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,200
We have strikes, things like that.

1316
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,200
Australia is another one very much interested

1317
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,120
by this strikes business.

1318
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,040
We are suffering because of that.

1319
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,960
I can see that clearly.

1320
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,360
That's happening in England also same thing.

1321
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,520
The reason is

1322
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,600
you do not know why you want to save money

1323
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,160
why do you want to have more money.

1324
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,240
Is this bottomless pit

1325
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:17,560
which you have to fill with alcohol.

1326
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,920
Alcohol is the curse of the West.

1327
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,200
That is the curse of the West.

1328
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,160
But human nature is so funny

1329
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,640
that they see a man falling down on the ground

1330
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,560
and enter into the same pub

1331
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,560
to come back and fall on the other side.

1332
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,720
Perhaps they think the other side is missing so let's fill it up.

1333
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,760
It's so stupid to see.

1334
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,400
I mean I was living in a place near the church.

1335
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,080
to be the biggest church of England

1336
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,600
in Catholic Church

1337
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:52,320
and the only activity I saw there in the morning was

1338
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,640
the

1339
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,720
beer. Big, big barrels of beer coming in

1340
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,000
and empty ones going out. That's all.

1341
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,280
No other entry no other exit.

1342
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,640
Only that much.

1343
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,080
From the back side from the sideways

1344
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,280
I saw this was the only thing going on

1345
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:15,280
and these priests are supposed to be godly people.

1346
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,680
It is so absurd you can't imagine.

1347
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,880
In Russia I went and they took me

1348
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:26,160
to a church. You see they had a Church of Orthodox.

1349
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,320
You too have here. I've seen Orthodox Church.

1350
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,080
And the fellow of the head of the church

1351
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,520
us that today that this is our fasting day so we can't eat meat

1352
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,400
but he drank so much

1353
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,800
that he become a drunk, you see.

1354
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,040
And we didn't know where to look.

1355
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,840
He got drunk completely.

1356
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,640
He was supposed to see us out because we are VIP's

1357
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,120
and there were three officers and then they started laughing.

1358
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,920
They said, "This is what Christianity is."

1359
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,600
I said "Why, why this?"

1360
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,120
He said, "You know what happend

1361
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,520
that Russians thought that they must also have a religion,

1362
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,640
after all everybody has a religion."

1363
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,680
They sent for someone.

1364
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,800
So the Muslims came in and they said,

1365
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,480
In Islam you can marry four times

1366
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,640
but you cannot have alcohol."

1367
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,720
They said, "This won't work out for such Russians.

1368
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,040
This is all right go out."

1369
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,640
So then they said, "Let's call Catholics."

1370
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,600
So they called Catholics

1371
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,280
and the Catholics said that, "You can

1372
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,720
have alcohol quite all right as much as you like."

1373
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,320
I don't know why they got this idea that they can have alcohol.

1374
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,160
[aside]

1375
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,840

1376
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,520

1377
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:45,200
"You must take a vow

1378
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,960
that you will not marry another woman,

1379
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,040
and that there is no divorce." They said, "This won't work out."

1380
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,120
But Orthodox Church was like our gurus.

1381
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,920
Said, "Do what you like.

1382
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,680
We are not bothered as long as you give your purse to us."

1383
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,760
And that's how Orthodox Church came. Can you believe it?

1384
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,960
This is the plight of the churches, of the temples now.

1385
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,080
I asked a little boy who

1386
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,040
was taking drugs, a Western boy.

1387
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:13,360
I said, "From where do you get?"

1388
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,600
He said, "From the temples of India."

1389
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,160
Can you imagine the temples.

1390
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,480
While you people think that all that is Indian is great, you see.

1391
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:23,320
Temples are great.

1392
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,720
Even lamas are another institution by themselves.

1393
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,960
You think lamas are great people. We had a big

1394
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,640
argument on that.

1395
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,720
These lamas extracted blood out of that Tibet.

1396
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,840
You won't believe.

1397
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,600
If you see a Tibetan he's just

1398
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,840
any blood, without any flesh in him.

1399
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,520
And these people lived in big [GLASS?] place

1400
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,640
you see with the golden cups

1401
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,840
with golden plates.

1402
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,040
And one of them came to Sweden and he told these people that,

1403
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:56,960
"If I come I must have a marble floor."

1404
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,160
What was he going to do with a marble floor? God only knows.

1405
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,920
Poor things. They starved themselves.

1406
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,040
These young people don't have so much money in the West.

1407
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,120
And made a marble floor for this great man to come in.

1408
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,640
He would sit seven feet high

1409
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,600
and what did he do there

1410
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,040
is to go just to bow 1001 times on that

1411
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:20,840
cold marble while they're sitting nicely on a very cozy place.

1412
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:25,160
And they got all kinds of diseases as with that.

1413
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,960
This is what it is. This is so called [UNCLEAR].

1414
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,160
Now one has to understand

1415
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:38,280
that religion is for your balance.

1416
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:42,920
Balance is for your ascent.

1417
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:47,920
And the ascent is the one you have to achieve.

1418
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,520
And if you cannot achieve your ascent

1419
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,600
through any method then you give it up completely

1420
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,960
because it would be something like

1421
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,880
not arriving at a point

1422
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,240
nor completing what you are.

1423
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:08,040
You are not complete unless and until you become the Spirit.

1424
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,680
And this is the biggest problem today is to bring to people

1425
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,200
this simple fact. It's very simple

1426
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,040
that Spirit is within you and can be enlightened

1427
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,040
spontaneously

1428
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,040
without any effort

1429
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,760
without reading about it because it's so [WHITE OR WIDE?].

1430
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:32,560
Just like your own heart beating.

1431
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:36,840
You cannot believe in a person who can be genuinely [BENEFACTOR?].

1432
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,880
Even some of them said, "Must be suspicious.

1433
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:43,360
She doesn't take any money." They can't believe it.

1434
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,040
How can I charge for my love?

1435
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:51,120
What can you pay?

1436
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:54,080
Can you value it in money?

1437
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,360
Can you imagine it in anything that exists?

1438
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,680
This joy is boundless.

1439
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,960
Is your own.

1440
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,800
Is just waiting

1441
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,680
to open its door. The flood

1442
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,520
of that joy is going to come into your life.

1443
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:14,640
But once you have got realization as Dr. Warren has said,

1444
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:17,320
"Be careful that you establish yourself."

1445
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,560
Individually every person can give realization

1446
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,200
to thousands. There's one Indian who's just a farmer

1447
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,200
has given realization to at least to ten thousand people

1448
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,520
whom I never met before.

1449
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,080
Of course he can't give en masse

1450
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,480
but still from one to another to another to another like that

1451
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,360
he has given ten thousand people,

1452
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,840
and he's a miraculous man.

1453
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,440
It is very easy to mock at these things and to make fun of this.

1454
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,520
It's a sign of superficiality.

1455
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:52,120
You are great.

1456
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,080
You are fantastic.

1457
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,080
I'm requesting you as a mother

1458
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,920
that just recognize yourself.

1459
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,240
Have your self esteem

1460
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:02,320
and don't worry as to what I've said.

1461
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,480
Whatever you have done is all forgiven once for all.

1462
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,080
At this moment you have to be absolutely

1463
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:13,400
beautifully placed as the most innocent people ever [UNCLEAR].

1464
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,960
No guilt of any kind.

1465
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,360
No guilt at all.

1466
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,800
Yesterday some people came there. Later I suffered here.

1467
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,880
I got the pain here.

1468
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,440
I suffered so much with this idea of guilt.

1469
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,800
Is all your own mental projection.

1470
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,080
So without any guilt you are going to get your realization today.

1471
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,080
I hope it works out with all of you.

1472
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,280
If it does not - tomorrow, day after.

1473
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:38,720
I'm going to tell you about the other chakras

1474
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,920
tomorrow and then about realization, about the Spirit.

1475
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:48,240
Then we want to have a

1476
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,240
as they call it which is a very funny word I find

1477
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,160
workshop as if you are all machines and I have

1478
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,800
to do some hammer to make your heads.

1479
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,720
But I've seen it's a blossom time

1480
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,400
and some gardening we are going to do.

1481
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,040
And we are going to invite you to some place on Sunday.

1482
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:10,120
Come and have lunch with us

1483
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,160
and we'll have very relaxed time

1484
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,920
and we'll enjoy this [FEELING or BEING?] within us.

1485
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,080
May God bless you.

1486
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,640
Unnecessary waste of time.

1487
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,640
We'll just

1488
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,720
have the realization.

1489
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,240
Now a very simple thing has to be done.

1490
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:10,080
Just take out your shoes

1491
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:14,720
because the Mother Earth is going to help us. Just take out.

1492
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,960
Also take out your spectacles because your eyesight might be helped.

1493
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:25,640
As I said before not feel guilty at all.

1494
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,440
Not at all guilty.

1495
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,440
First of all before closing your eyes you have to tell yourself,

1496
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,440
"I am not at all guilty."

1497
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:34,960
Thrice you must tell yourself assertively that,

1498
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:38,400
"Mother I am not at all guilty

1499
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,400
of anything."

1500
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,760
Because I am talking of God

1501
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:48,320
who is so anxious to give you this.

1502
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:52,640
Who is the ocean of love.

1503
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:58,600
Who is the ocean of forgiveness.

1504
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,960
You should sit with relaxed mind.

1505
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,200
Put your hands towards Me just like this.

1506
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:16,200
Simple way like this just put on your lap.

1507
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,200
Just like that.

1508
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,680
You can keep it on the ground. [UNCLEAR].

1509
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,240
You can keep it here, down below. Yes.

1510
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,320
Be comfortable.

1511
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,600
Be comfortable if you have a

1512
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,840
very strong on your neck you can little bit reduce it

1513
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,760
if it is tightening or in any way hot for you.

1514
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,040
Anything

1515
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:45,600
whichever thing which way you are comfortable is the best way.

1516
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,400
You.

1517
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,280
Now with a cheerful mind you have to [LISTEN TO ME

1518
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,200
Not to be angry with yourself.

1519
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,880
In no way be angry with yourself.

1520
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,160
So put both the hands

1521
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:07,400
on your lap and close your eyes.

1522
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,240
Just close your eyes.

1523
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:21,040
So as a result of the kundalini awakening

1524
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,760
what happens

1525
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,560
that first of all that you start

1526
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,520
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head. Is

1527
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Is the real baptism.

1528
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,760
That's the first thing that should happen

1529
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,040
that the cool breeze starts coming out of your head.

1530
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,320
Please don't open your eyes.

1531
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,280
Please just don't open your eyes

1532
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:43,880
because if you open your eyes

1533
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,400
kundalini won't rise above Agnya Chakra.

1534
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,160
So just keep your eyes shut.

1535
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,720
It will help a lot.

1536
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,680
Not to bend your neck too much

1537
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,680
to put back, but be straight.

1538
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,640
Be straight and parallel. Be comfortable.

1539
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,040
Put both the hands straight on the Mother Earth

1540
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:06,880
away from each other. Not touching each other.

1541
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:32,520
Now the first center that I told you about

1542
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:38,200
is the center of your chastity of your wisdom.

1543
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,320
So you have to say, "Mother please

1544
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:45,320
awaken the innocence within me."

1545
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:51,240
Just to say that because this is your right.

1546
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,480
cannot force you.

1547
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,600
You have to ask. This is your freedom.

1548
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,080
If you do not want it I cannot do it.

1549
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:08,720
You have to ask that, "Please awaken my innocence within me

1550
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,280
and my desire to be one

1551
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:19,560
with the Divine should be intense."

1552
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,840
"Please awaken my kundalini,

1553
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:43,320
this desire within me,

1554
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:55,880
and make me that all the technique of Divine love."

1555
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,920
That is called as shuddha vidya is the pure knowledge

1556
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,880
of the technique.

1557
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,600
You have to ask. That's the problem is

1558
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,320
because human beings have been given something

1559
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,640
which cannot be taken away.

1560
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,920
Not to feel guilty at all

1561
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,480
is again I said every time

1562
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:29,000
don't feel guilty.

1563
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,040
Don't say how can I do it. What will -

1564
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:32,800
It's all within you. It's just waiting.

1565
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,720
The whole instrument is there.

1566
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:38,280
Just I have to connect it. You just help me.

1567
01:40:44,240 --> 01:40:45,960
By not feeling guilty at all

1568
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:49,280
because your guilt has no meaning at all

1569
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,320
to the ocean of love

1570
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,040
it's not even a speck. It can be washed off in no time

1571
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,840
so you just don't stick onto your guilt.

1572
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:18,720
Now left hand is your power of desire

1573
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:24,240
and right hand is your power of action.

1574
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,280
So keep the left hand as it is towards Me

1575
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,680
so the desire is steadied there

1576
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:35,960
and use the right hand first of all on your heart.

1577
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,720
Put your right hand on the heart.

1578
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,480
In the heart resides

1579
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:45,720
the Spirit, the reflection of God Almighty.

1580
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:51,520
So you have to say, "Mother make me the Spirit."

1581
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,280
Now you have to become the master.

1582
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,320
Master of all these trigunas,

1583
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,280
the three powers I've told you.

1584
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,320
Like you have got in a car

1585
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,320
the break and accelerator.

1586
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,120
You have these three powers within you

1587
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,600
by which

1588
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,680
you first of all you make mistakes these two powers

1589
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,160
and then you become the third power

1590
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:27,720
which is the automatic driving power.

1591
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,400
You learn it.

1592
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,800
Just becomes part and parcel of you. Don't think about it.

1593
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,640
And then the master is sitting behind the car.

1594
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,440
You become that.

1595
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:45,680
When you become the master you start seeing the driver in you

1596
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:47,880
you and all these powers within you

1597
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,880
and handle them

1598
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:53,800
just like a master handles his own vehicle

1599
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,040
you handle it and you just don't get into tantrums and

1600
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,040
you do all kinds of things which are not

1601
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:02,160
within your reach within your control.

1602
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:04,240
That's how you become the master.

1603
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,840
So to become the master you put your right hand

1604
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,880
your stomach on the left hand side.

1605
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,960
Right hand

1606
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,720
on the left hand side of your stomach.

1607
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,600
Right hand on the left hand side of your stomach.

1608
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,120
Right hand on the left hand side of your stomach

1609
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:28,040
left hand towards Me.

1610
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:40,960
Now you have to say, "Mother make me my own master."

1611
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,400
Say it thrice.

1612
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,480
Then

1613
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:05,440
now you have to say, "Mother I am my own master."

1614
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,800
Put your left hand towards Me please.

1615
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,920
Left hand should be towards Me, yes.

1616
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:15,160
Open, open. Not closed hand.

1617
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,600
Now say, "Mother make me my own master."

1618
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,360
You have to be your own master.

1619
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,560
You are not to be guided by any master or anyone.

1620
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,600
It's your Spirit which is going to guide you.

1621
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,840
Just say ten times, "I am my own master."

1622
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,880
Now raise the same hand

1623
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:20,520
higher to the Spirit to your heart

1624
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:26,440
and now say 10 times, "Mother I am the Spirit."

1625
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,360
Ten times.

1626
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,520
Just right hand. Don't move left hand. Only move right hand.

1627
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:36,120
Left hand you keep all the time stretched.

1628
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:39,160
hand you move to the heart and say ten times,

1629
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:44,040
"Mother I am the Spirit."

1630
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,760
Now.

1631
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:11,560
Put the right hand on the left hand side of your neck.

1632
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,040
Left hand side of your neck on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

1633
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,320
The Left Vishuddhi.

1634
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:20,840
We are working on the left throughout.

1635
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,400
So you say, "Mother

1636
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,120
I am not guilty."

1637
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:31,960
sixteen times as a punishment.

1638
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,520
Just say, "Mother I am not guilty."

1639
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:06,760
Sixteen times.

1640
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,360
This will cure lots of your problems

1641
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,800
of guilt, of diffidence.

1642
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:25,760
You cannot be guilty because you are the Spirit.

1643
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:28,000
The Spirit cannot be guilty.

1644
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:32,360

1645
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:37,920
Now put your right hand again.

1646
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:42,920
Left hand being there where it is. On your forehead across.

1647
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:46,520
On your forehead across

1648
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,920
at the center of our Lord Jesus Christ

1649
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:55,560
and say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

1650
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:01,720
With your full heart you should say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

1651
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,760
Because if you don't forgive you are working under a myth

1652
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:16,520
because you are not troubling the person.

1653
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,800
The person is troubling you.

1654
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,200
Just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

1655
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:26,040
Some people say it is difficult. It is the easiest thing.

1656
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:32,160
Just your mental projection it is.

1657
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:59,040
Now put this right hand on top of your head.

1658
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,160
You'll find it's little hot.

1659
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,800
The heat is coming out of your body.

1660
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,320
Just put it on top of your head. Head.

1661
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,840
The heat is coming out. Press it.

1662
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:13,320
The palm of the hand should be pressed in the center.

1663
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,320
find there is a heat. Press it.

1664
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,360
At this point you have to have to ask for your realization again

1665
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,320
because I cannot force it on you.

1666
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,960
So you have to say, "Mother I want my realization.

1667
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:31,040
Please give me my realization.

1668
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,840
I'm a seeker of truth.

1669
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:44,160
Please give me my realization, Mother."

1670
01:49:55,600 --> 01:50:01,640
Now raise your hand and see if there is a cool breeze coming out.

1671
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,320
You can change your hand. Put your right hand towards Me

1672
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:18,400
and put the left hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

1673
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:24,640
Right hand towards Me not closed but open, open hand.

1674
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:30,560
[FIRST TIME?]

1675
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,960
which is doing all the living work,

1676
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,640
everything around us.

1677
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:41,600
Now put down your hands please

1678
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:45,720
and see if you are feeling now in your hands.

1679
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:50,480
Just see if you are feeling in your hands also.

1680
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:52,720
feel very relaxed.

1681
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,240
[COULD BRING?] peace, bliss of God

1682
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:02,720
and kingdom of God on this Earth.

1683
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:15,800
Please raise the hands who have felt the cool breeze in their hands

1684
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,000
All of you have felt it.

1685
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,240
That's great.

1686
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,600
Very great.

1687
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,800
So many of you have felt.

1688
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,640
May God bless you.

1689
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:37,880
You need not think about it.

1690
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:44,640
Only thing I will tell you how to fix your kundalini better

1691
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,040
because you see it's like fixing

1692
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:52,200
it into a plug properly otherwise it can be loose a little bit.

1693
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:58,160
So Warren will tell you how to do it. Just tell.

1694
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,760
WARREN: Just put your left hand near the kundalini at this point.

1695
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,360
SHRI MATAJI: Put the left hand

1696
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,680
towards your kundalini, little in front.

1697
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,360
WARREN: And the right hand in front

1698
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,960
and you come around in that fashion.

1699
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:19,160
SHRI MATAJI: First higher, forward, lower, backwards.

1700
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,360
Like that.

1701
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,720
You have to move. This is the left hand which moves steady

1702
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:26,120
and the right hand moves round and round like that clockwise.

1703
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:27,560
Now you go on moving it.

1704
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,640
WARREN: You raise it.

1705
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,200
SHRI MATAJI: Raise it - your kundalini. Go up.

1706
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,920
Take it up. Push back your hands.

1707
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:35,560
them loose.

1708
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,080
Push it up. [MAKE IT A BIT?]. Twist

1709
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,800
on top of your head

1710
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,360
and now give it a knot.

1711
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:48,760
This is first time. This is for the first power.

1712
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,920
For the second power again

1713
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:55,680
put your hand in front of your kundalini but do it properly.

1714
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:00,800
Higher, in front, lower and backwards again.

1715
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,800
Start doing it. Raise it.

1716
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,800
Go high

1717
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,680
and push your back your hands

1718
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,520
and just give it a big twist again.

1719
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,360
Now for third power you have to do it thrice. Three knots.

1720
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:22,120
Don't put down your hands but just do it three times.

1721
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,440
Again let's do it.

1722
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:27,880
are raising your own kundalini.

1723
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,920
Go up again. Push back your hands. Give fast twist.

1724
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,480
Keep your hands there. Give it a knot.

1725
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:38,760
Again twist your hand

1726
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,080
and give it a knot.

1727
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,600
Again twist your hand

1728
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,840
and now give it a big knot.

1729
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:52,120
Now see for yourself if your hands are working better.

1730
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:01,440
These are the hands that are going to speak

1731
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:03,920
as told by Muhammad Sahab

1732
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:08,520
that at the time of your resurrection your hands will speak.

1733
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:12,320
Now you can see that in the hands he has shown the chakras,

1734
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,040
the fingertips.

1735
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:15,840
All these I will tell you.

1736
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,320
Today's three chakras I'll tell you where they are.

1737
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:21,400
Left side is left side. Right side is right side

1738
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:23,640
and the center side is here.

1739
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,760
And the three chakras we have.

1740
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,320
The first chakras is this one on the left hand side.

1741
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,240
This is right hand side first chakra.

1742
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,720
And the second chakra we have are these.

1743
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,440
One on the left hand side, right hand side.

1744
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:39,480
And the third chakra are these.

1745
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,920
Both the left hand side and right hand side.

1746
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:43,320
Now what you feel

1747
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,000
if there's something wrong with these chakras within yourself

1748
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,440
you will feel a little burning

1749
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:51,880
or maybe little numbness

1750
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,680
maybe some heaviness.

1751
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:57,760
What all these things indicate I'll tell you tomorrow.

1752
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:59,720
And on other people also you can feel

1753
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,880
but just now you don't try with other people

1754
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,640
because it's like a sprouting of a seed which is very delicate.

1755
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,480
You have to look after it.

1756
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:10,360
Tomorrow and day after we'll work it out.

1757
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,280
You establish yourself fully in Sahaja Yoga.

1758
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:18,440
You have to become a guru, a complete guru of your own.

1759
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,880
May God bless you.

1760
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,680
WARREN: As Mother said there will be a workshop on Sunday.

1761
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:43,160
We'll give the address tomorrow night, Friday night

1762
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,360
SHRI MATAJI: You tell them just now.

1763
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,880
WARREN: and you are all invited.

1764
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,400
Mother will work it out.

1765
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,640
And

1766
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:55,440
the whole day free because we're happy to show you

1767
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,280
all the aspects of Kundalini and the chakras.

1768
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:01,640
Bring your lunch along.

1769
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,480
It should be a good day.

1770
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:07,080
Tomorrow evening Mother will speak about the Heart Chakra,

1771
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,960
the center of security within us.

1772
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,320
The Vishuddhi Chakra which is the center

1773
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:15,760
in which we are able to witness the drama of life

1774
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:17,760
and get our self esteem.

1775
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:22,200
And the Agnya Chakra which is the center of Christ which relates to

1776
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,520
the principle of the Spirit,

1777
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,800
the quality of forgiveness.

1778
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,160
And then finally the Sahasrara Chakra which is the center

1779
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:36,120
which Mataji Herself has opened in this incarnation.

1780
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:41,640
So the two successive lectures are going to deal with those centers.

1781
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,360
Thank you very much and good evening.
