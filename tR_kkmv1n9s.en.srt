1
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:20,987
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:35,142
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

3
00:27:35,142 --> 00:27:43,250
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

4
00:27:46,234 --> 00:28:03,172
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

5
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:07,392
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

6
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:20,752
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

7
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:33,101
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

8
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:42,642
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

9
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:48,964
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

10
00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:51,153
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

11
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:56,125
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

12
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,299
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

13
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,875
to bend our ways.].

14
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:13,401
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

15
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:27,142
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

16
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:36,499
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him

17
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,964
as far as the hinsa is concerned.

18
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:48,052
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

19
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,553
mosquitoes of Delhi.

20
00:29:50,625 --> 00:30:09,452
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

21
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:24,072
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

22
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:30,787
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.”

23
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:39,362
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

24
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:42,036
Because they were not enlightened people,

25
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:45,946
are already dead people their eyes are not open.

26
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:50,153
Whom are You going to kill here?

27
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:56,602
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma."

28
00:30:57,602 --> 00:31:03,643
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

29
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:07,147
sort of a ism; it is not.

30
00:31:07,172 --> 00:31:15,302
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

31
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:17,732
ten valencies in a human being.

32
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:24,412
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

33
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:33,532
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

34
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:46,372
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

35
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:50,412
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

36
00:31:50,412 --> 00:32:08,482
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

37
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:22,921
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

38
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:33,639
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your  weapons.”

39
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:40,882
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

40
00:32:40,882 --> 00:32:49,748
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

41
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:56,030
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and

42
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:59,364
what was He doing at that time?”

43
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,910
And Arjuna killed Karna.

44
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,549
This is Dharma.

45
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:24,625
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

46
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:30,362
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

47
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:35,081
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent

48
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:37,606
 because you do not agree with some people.

49
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:44,100
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

50
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:54,201
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

51
00:33:54,201 --> 00:34:00,100
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

52
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:11,887
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

53
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:19,081
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

54
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:27,577
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

55
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:30,261
That is not Krishna’s message.

56
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:37,597
He showed His love by killing the demons.

57
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:48,914
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

58
00:34:48,939 --> 00:34:52,639
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him

59
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:55,318
 with some new subject matters.

60
00:34:55,343 --> 00:35:01,342
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

61
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:04,671
point one should try to see.

62
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:20,421
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

63
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:27,936
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

64
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:37,804
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

65
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:48,302
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

66
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:51,852
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

67
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:56,972
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

68
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,762
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

69
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:15,122
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

70
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:22,672
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

71
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:29,188
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated,

72
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,803
intellectuals, whatever you may call them.

73
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:39,829
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

74
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:48,872
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

75
00:36:48,872 --> 00:36:54,195
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

76
00:36:54,703 --> 00:36:57,367
Thank God we are not that advanced.

77
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:08,003
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

78
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:15,824
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

79
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:21,164
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

80
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:24,632
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

81
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:29,622
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

82
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:34,952
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

83
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,498
consuming everyone.

84
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:47,493
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

85
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:53,186
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

86
00:37:53,843 --> 00:38:00,427
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into

87
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:04,046
some far fetched places like Peru.

88
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:12,290
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

89
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:20,062
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

90
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:25,932
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

91
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:30,075
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this,

92
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,502
we are going to that.

93
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:35,232
What about going inside in the ascent?

94
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:47,189
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

95
00:38:47,903 --> 00:38:52,261
But you are seeing it from the outside.

96
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:58,026
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

97
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:04,056
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes

98
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:06,167
to find what?

99
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:15,912
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

100
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,862
Awareness reached there also.

101
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:25,092
Then it has gone further.

102
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:32,782
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

103
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:39,612
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

104
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:41,922
Creator Brahmadeva.

105
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:52,793
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

106
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:55,602
is the support of human life.

107
00:39:55,602 --> 00:40:01,732
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

108
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:09,412
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

109
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:16,683
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points,

110
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,763
I can tell you.

111
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:28,260
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth

112
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:30,482
beyond Ganesha.

113
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:37,102
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

114
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:43,109
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

115
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:50,087
Where our awareness is going today?

116
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:56,542
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

117
00:40:56,542 --> 00:41:03,662
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

118
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,362
What about the urdvagati?

119
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:11,994
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

120
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:17,412
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

121
00:41:17,412 --> 00:41:22,672
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

122
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:25,982
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

123
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:33,103
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

124
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:41,292
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that

125
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,480
sixth chapter is tabooed.

126
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:47,310
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

127
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:53,040
Why?

128
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:58,975
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

129
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:04,402
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

130
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:15,262
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

131
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:26,042
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

132
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:32,442
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

133
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:35,077
He did not say; that was not the time.

134
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:41,292
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

135
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,552
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

136
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:53,564
Marx   said that we would like to have a country
without State.

137
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:54,461
How?

138
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,448
How will you have?

139
00:42:56,676 --> 00:43:03,082
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

140
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:09,382
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

141
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:11,604
Free?

142
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:12,993
Abandonment.

143
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:16,662
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

144
00:43:16,662 --> 00:43:21,628
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood

145
00:43:21,653 --> 00:43:23,622
 nobody can help you.

146
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:31,612
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

147
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:39,263
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

148
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,912
It has not given what it had promised.

149
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:58,118
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

150
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:01,301
life beyond life.

151
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:12,556
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

152
00:44:13,414 --> 00:44:16,522
How, is the point?

153
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:25,941
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

154
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:28,411
talked about the Resurrection.

155
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,921
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

156
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:33,810
Who’s bothered about that?

157
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:37,691
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

158
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:44,806
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

159
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:47,469
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

160
00:44:47,596 --> 00:44:49,678
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

161
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:56,441
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

162
00:44:56,441 --> 00:45:00,791
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

163
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:08,360
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all

164
00:45:08,385 --> 00:45:10,152
fighting about it.

165
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:21,872
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

166
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:35,259
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel

167
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:36,978
of the whole.

168
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:40,396
It’s not just a mental conception.

169
00:45:40,443 --> 00:45:42,941
This is the point we miss every time.

170
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:51,644
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections

171
00:45:51,669 --> 00:45:53,318
of human beings.

172
00:45:53,858 --> 00:46:02,892
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

173
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:04,701
you are caught up.

174
00:46:04,944 --> 00:46:08,570
You have to get out of it.

175
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:16,982
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write

176
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,201
Saundarya Lahiri.

177
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:19,488
Who says that?

178
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:21,442
Intellectuals again.

179
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,761
What makes them think that he did not write?

180
00:46:25,912 --> 00:46:28,252
They have explanations for everything.

181
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:35,145
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

182
00:46:35,691 --> 00:46:42,982
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

183
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:46,481
and not through discussions.

184
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:56,832
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

185
00:46:56,832 --> 00:46:58,522
awakened within us.

186
00:46:58,522 --> 00:47:02,041
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

187
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:07,091
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

188
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:09,412
talk about Self-Realization”.

189
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:11,742
Same with Mahavira.

190
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:14,238
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

191
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:15,404
God alone knows.

192
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:17,590
Where are they?

193
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:30,512
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

194
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:36,221
A special time is a time of real blossom.

195
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:40,652
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

196
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:48,362
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

197
00:47:48,362 --> 00:47:58,302
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

198
00:47:58,302 --> 00:48:03,372
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

199
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:05,502
heads and they just finish off there.

200
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:12,131
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

201
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:16,331
They do not want to go any further.

202
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:26,007
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

203
00:48:26,032 --> 00:48:30,022
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

204
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:39,052
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

205
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:47,162
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

206
00:48:47,162 --> 00:48:56,406
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

207
00:48:57,152 --> 00:49:03,002
The left we use when we desire.

208
00:49:03,002 --> 00:49:07,132
The right we use when we act.

209
00:49:07,132 --> 00:49:14,281
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

210
00:49:14,281 --> 00:49:20,132
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

211
00:49:20,132 --> 00:49:31,312
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

212
00:49:31,312 --> 00:49:39,764
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

213
00:49:39,764 --> 00:49:47,772
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

214
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:52,892
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

215
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:54,502
other things took place.

216
00:49:54,502 --> 00:49:57,692
And afterwards we are today human beings.

217
00:49:58,818 --> 00:50:00,653
But why?

218
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:05,831
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

219
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,597
To seek what?

220
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:14,088
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

221
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:19,308
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

222
00:50:20,081 --> 00:50:30,002
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

223
00:50:30,002 --> 00:50:34,431
But you are the Spirit.

224
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:41,262
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

225
00:50:41,262 --> 00:50:43,172
without Self-Realization.

226
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,502
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

227
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:50,362
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

228
00:50:50,362 --> 00:50:54,291
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

229
00:50:54,291 --> 00:51:02,522
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

230
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:04,519
What does He say?

231
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:10,520
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

232
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:14,162
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

233
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:16,395
means you are a realized soul.

234
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,382
Logically let us see what does it mean?

235
00:51:21,382 --> 00:51:27,081
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

236
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:30,722
The connection has to be established.

237
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:34,601
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on

238
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:36,732
supporting Him doing anything you like.

239
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:44,030
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

240
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:49,061
Something in the air.

241
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:52,321
‘Ananya bhakti’.

242
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:55,162
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

243
00:51:55,162 --> 00:51:59,591
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

244
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:11,746
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing

245
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,182
at the Lotus Feet   of the Lord.

246
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:21,083
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

247
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:24,338
Before Realization you cannot do this.

248
00:52:24,363 --> 00:52:29,032
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

249
00:52:29,032 --> 00:52:34,541
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

250
00:52:37,084 --> 00:52:38,966
What does that mean?

251
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:46,058
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

252
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:55,461
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

253
00:52:55,461 --> 00:53:01,841
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.”

254
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:06,831
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

255
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:13,762
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

256
00:53:13,762 --> 00:53:17,551
a very rich man and all those things.

257
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:19,835
So he could not get his Realization.

258
00:53:20,137 --> 00:53:23,362
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.”

259
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:24,572
I said, “You give him.”

260
00:53:24,597 --> 00:53:27,087
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.”

261
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:32,593
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

262
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:36,127
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

263
00:53:36,152 --> 00:53:40,236
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.”

264
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,301
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

265
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,301
I said, “That’s it.

266
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:53,732
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

267
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:57,932
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.”

268
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,687
She agreed there.

269
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:03,262
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

270
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:08,181
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

271
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,482
You don’t say that you are doing it.

272
00:54:10,482 --> 00:54:16,924
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

273
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:21,624
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.”

274
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:25,011
In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

275
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:31,796
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

276
00:54:33,431 --> 00:54:39,041
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

277
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:48,288
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

278
00:54:48,313 --> 00:54:52,352
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

279
00:54:52,352 --> 00:54:58,143
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

280
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:04,022
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

281
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:14,301
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

282
00:55:14,301 --> 00:55:23,946
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

283
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:32,099
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand

284
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:36,726
with little subtler feelings about it.

285
00:55:37,265 --> 00:55:44,841
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

286
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:49,489
formless and here is standing in the form.

287
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:53,492
Where do you find these talks these days?

288
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:59,691
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

289
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:11,471
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

290
00:56:11,471 --> 00:56:15,221
– the formless and here it is in the form.

291
00:56:15,526 --> 00:56:17,406
But he was a tailor.

292
00:56:17,431 --> 00:56:21,749
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

293
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:34,402
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

294
00:56:34,402 --> 00:56:41,252
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

295
00:56:41,252 --> 00:56:51,099
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

296
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:57,222
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

297
00:56:57,222 --> 00:57:05,654
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

298
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:09,652
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

299
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:17,022
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

300
00:57:17,022 --> 00:57:25,222
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

301
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:30,154
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

302
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:37,102
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

303
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:44,530
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

304
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:46,081
has to work out.

305
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:55,719
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

306
00:57:55,744 --> 00:58:03,742
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

307
00:58:03,742 --> 00:58:10,201
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

308
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:19,291
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

309
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:26,581
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

310
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:32,646
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

311
00:58:33,115 --> 00:58:39,061
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

312
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,081
accelerate the third one.

313
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:54,122
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

314
00:58:54,122 --> 00:59:02,161
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

315
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:05,701
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

316
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:11,035
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

317
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,450
is the power of love of God.

318
00:59:16,484 --> 00:59:23,312
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

319
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:24,312
First He said ‘yoga’.

320
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,761
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

321
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:33,810
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

322
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:37,411
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

323
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:42,210
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

324
00:59:42,235 --> 00:59:51,919
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

325
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:56,518
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means,

326
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,589
 how many saints there are in your country.

327
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:06,756
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

328
01:00:06,781 --> 01:00:09,841
day show its merit to the whole world.

329
01:00:09,841 --> 01:00:20,581
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

330
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:26,341
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

331
01:00:26,341 --> 01:00:29,622
no idea as to where you are born?

332
01:00:29,622 --> 01:00:31,843
What is your heritage?

333
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:37,730
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

334
01:00:39,781 --> 01:00:54,071
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

335
01:00:54,071 --> 01:01:03,801
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

336
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:10,182
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

337
01:01:10,182 --> 01:01:14,192
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

338
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:27,422
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

339
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:44,951
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

340
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:50,802
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

341
01:01:50,802 --> 01:01:58,302
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

342
01:01:58,327 --> 01:02:02,914
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

343
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:04,792
May God bless you all.

344
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:16,432
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

345
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,853
Try to understand.

346
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:24,740
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

347
01:02:24,765 --> 01:02:28,912
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

348
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:33,422
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

349
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:39,062
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

350
01:02:39,062 --> 01:02:42,751
God is not going to fall at your feet.

351
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:46,832
You have to ask for it.

352
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:50,696
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

353
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:59,152
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

354
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:07,799
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

355
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:10,023
Saab and Shri Krishna.

356
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,456
They are all one together.

357
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:17,681
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

358
01:03:18,011 --> 01:03:19,622
” Who wants to see that?

359
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:23,102
Who are those?

360
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:30,612
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

361
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:36,302
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

362
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:38,939
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

363
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:43,812
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

364
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:45,852
But not in our villages.

365
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:52,862
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

366
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,352
all this and this, My Indian English.

367
01:03:56,352 --> 01:04:02,731
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

368
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,672
went inside or maybe under their feet.

369
01:04:07,156 --> 01:04:13,072
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

370
01:04:13,072 --> 01:04:19,503
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

371
01:04:19,528 --> 01:04:24,612
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

372
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:27,731
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

373
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:30,242
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

374
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:31,954
Humko atma gyan.

375
01:04:32,224 --> 01:04:39,242
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

376
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:44,845
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

377
01:04:44,893 --> 01:04:47,825
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

378
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:53,524
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

379
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:56,516
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

380
01:04:56,549 --> 01:05:02,306
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

381
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:07,087
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

382
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:11,148
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

383
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:12,783
We should be transformed.

384
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:18,716
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

385
01:05:19,121 --> 01:05:27,170
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

386
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:30,804
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized;

387
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:34,054
when they were here we were better off.

388
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:47,231
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

389
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:55,848
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

390
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:59,915
done as a yogi.

391
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:07,780
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

392
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:16,967
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

393
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:28,621
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

394
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:32,903
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

395
01:06:32,944 --> 01:06:34,164
that, maybe.

396
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:38,939
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

397
01:06:38,964 --> 01:06:43,870
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

398
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:45,145
[pratigya?

399
01:06:45,247 --> 01:06:47,951
May God bless you.
