1
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:23,684
Today, we have gathered here

2
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:31,158
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

3
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:43,893
The One, which is reflected within us, is the Shiva -

4
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:49,070
which is the pure Spirit.

5
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:57,597
This pure Spirit within us is the reflection

6
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:01,751
of God Almighty - Sadashiva.

7
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:14,214
It's like the sun that falls

8
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:22,011
in the water and gives a clear reflection,

9
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:27,378
or else it falls on the stone -

10
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:31,891
it doesn't give any reflection at all.

11
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:35,911
If you have, say, the mirror,

12
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:41,263
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

13
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:47,768
but will reflect back its light.

14
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,021
In the same way in the human beings

15
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:57,654
the reflection of God Almighty

16
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:04,901
is expressed in the way your personality is.

17
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:11,928
If your personality is clean and clear, innocent,

18
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:17,379
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

19
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,217
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God Almighty

20
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:30,272
in the proper manner, in the sense

21
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:36,858
that their own identification with wrong things is no more.

22
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:41,108
When there is no such identification

23
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:48,934
and when a person is absolutely the pure Spirit,

24
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:55,286
then the reflection of God reflects into others.

25
00:05:55,487 --> 00:06:01,966
Luckily you all have got your Self Realization.

26
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,841
That means the reflection of God Almighty

27
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:10,466
is already working into your attention.

28
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:22,059
The attention is enlightened by the power of the Spirit.

29
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:29,369
The power of the Spirit is that it is a reflection.

30
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,361
That means the reflection is never

31
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:44,393
identified with the mirror or with the water.

32
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:51,829
It is there till the sun shines,

33
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,319
and when there is no sun there is no reflection.

34
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:06,407
So, when you are in Sahaja Yoga,

35
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:10,321
you have cleansed out yourself.

36
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:14,196
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

37
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:17,696
and now you are pure personalities.

38
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:25,117
That's why this reflection is clearer and clearer,

39
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:29,055
and people see it - see it on your face,

40
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:33,384
they see it in your body, they see it in your work,

41
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:37,741
in your behavior, in everywhere.

42
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,965
It is difficult for people to really believe in themselves,

43
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:51,113
that they could be the reflection of God Almighty.

44
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,980
They have some sort of a complexes about themselves,

45
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:05,121
I think, that they cannot understand
how they have suddenly become

46
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:09,548
the reflection of God Almighty.

47
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:15,504
But they have a capacity

48
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:22,442
and they can become the reflection of God Almighty,

49
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:26,200
for which they have to have faith in themselves,

50
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:32,838
faith in their ascent - to believe that “we have become that”.

51
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:41,895
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

52
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:47,335
Without the full confidence, you cannot achieve your ascent -

53
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:51,152
that you have seen. Even in My lectures I have to tell them

54
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:55,308
that we have to have full self-confidence.

55
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,777
But confidence doesn't mean, by any chance,

56
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:02,472
your ego, your aggressiveness.

57
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:08,501
If you are confident, you are least aggressive.

58
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:13,850
There is a story, a Chinese story, very interesting one,

59
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:19,717
that one king wanted his cocks to win in the

60
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:24,425
race they have about the cock fighting.

61
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:27,450
So somebody said that there is a saint,

62
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:33,587
if you can take your cocks to him he'll make them so strong

63
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:37,587
that they will definitely win this race.

64
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:41,818
So he took his two cocks and gave it to the saint and he said,

65
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:48,879
“I want you to give them all the strength to fight this race”.

66
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,650
After one month, the king
came and took these two cocks

67
00:09:55,851 --> 00:10:00,822
and put them in the arena where there were many other cocks also.

68
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:09,800
So the cocks started fighting and attacking these two cocks,

69
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:15,245
but these two cocks were just standing very patiently,

70
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,448
absolutely calm and quiet.

71
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:21,466
Any kind of attack

72
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:25,479
they were just looking at it as a fun,

73
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:29,825
and all the cocks got tired and they ran away from the arena,

74
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:34,942
and that's how these two cocks won the game.

75
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:38,762
This is what it is for us to understand,

76
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:44,395
that for a person who is detached, he can never be attacked.

77
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,359
We are attacked by so many identifications we have.

78
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,245
Firstly, our family, then our country, then our religion,

79
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:57,159
 

80
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,032
then all kinds of thing, racialism.

81
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,602
All these identifications really make us weak,

82
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:06,266
because they attack us all the time

83
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:11,383
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

84
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:15,000
The reason is, you must have confidence in Sahaja Yoga

85
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:19,852
and confidence in yourself - that you are on the right path

86
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:25,297
and that you are now saved, and nobody can attack you

87
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:29,570
because you have the complete protection of the Divine.

88
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,101
People may follow any religion,

89
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,240
they may follow any guru, they may follow anything,

90
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:40,385
but they have fear all the time that “we'll be attacked”,

91
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:43,768
and they're afraid to say things, which they should say.

92
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,161
They have no discretion even to know

93
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,319
what is to be said.

94
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:57,719
With the proper understanding that you are the pure Spirit,

95
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,222
if you believe in that then you'll be surprised that

96
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:09,669
you will be very confident about what you are doing.

97
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,851
In that way we can say

98
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:17,421
that we have also another great advantage -

99
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:21,484
is that we are in the collective.

100
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:28,062
We can find out in the collective how are we behaving.

101
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:31,382
What is the reaction in the collective?

102
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:37,661
In the collective it's a person who is very subtle,

103
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:41,583
he need not talk too much, he need not say much.

104
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:45,192
He could stand like the cocks I told you about,

105
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:48,770
but his depth can be felt.

106
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:52,325
You can feel a person of that caliber,

107
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:57,442
that he's such a deep person, that he doesn't want to aggress.

108
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,192
He feels protected within himself.

109
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,872
So this protection we have to feel,

110
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:07,841
not mentally but within ourselves,

111
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,286
and once you have that gravity,

112
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:16,544
that feeling, nobody can attack.

113
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:21,692
The attacking person himself is insecure,

114
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,620
or maybe he’s ill bred, maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

115
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,719
 

116
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:33,412
So you have to just have a kind of a

117
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:39,331
gracious view about the person.

118
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,623
Like Shiva was,

119
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:46,473
we should say Sadashiva's character is known, that

120
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:50,465
He is the one who used to forgive anyone.

121
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,793
Anybody who did penance like standing on their heads,

122
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,548
or standing on one foot, or not eating their food,

123
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,779
or all kinds of penances, He used to be so disgusted

124
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,545
that He would say, "Alright, what do you want? Take it."

125
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:10,640
And He also gave blessings to many rakshasas

126
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,203
as you have heard,

127
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,886
and so many rakshasas were blessed by Him

128
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:20,589
because He got fed up with their penances.

129
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,540
There were so many stories about Sadashiva

130
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:32,063
giving a blessing to people.

131
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:35,473
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting story about Ravana,

132
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,119
 

133
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:41,124
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don't know what he did,

134
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:44,843
how much he must have starved with his ten heads

135
00:14:45,044 --> 00:14:47,749
and what…

136
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,020
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so hungry -

137
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,494
with ten mouths, you see.

138
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,728
I don't know what he must have done

139
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,417
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva just got fed up, you see.

140
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,719
 

141
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,977
His compassion is so great He thought,

142
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,672
‘Let this man have whatever he likes.’

143
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:11,516
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said: “What do you want?

144
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:14,883
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”

145
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:19,266
So he said that, ”I want to have a blessing.”

146
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,860
He said, ”What blessing?”

147
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:24,696
”First you promise that whatever I ask for, you will give me.”

148
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:27,884
He said, “Of course. If it is in my power, I'll give.”

149
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,280
It's a very interesting story.

150
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:36,272
So he said, ”I want to have your wife.”

151
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:39,420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

152
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:44,834
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner with him,

153
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:48,406
he can do wonders. So he asked that

154
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:55,849
”I should get your wife as my partner.”

155
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:00,338
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for Him

156
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:04,955
to take such a decision to give him, to this devil,

157
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:09,010
but in compassion He did it. And all these events, you see,

158
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:18,834
really show that how His compassion works out things.

159
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:28,908
As a result, it was decided that the…

160
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:35,197
His wife Parvati had to go with this horrible fellow.

161
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:43,828
But Parvati's sister was Shri Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

162
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,078
and He said to Himself

163
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,953
that, "I can't allow my sister to go with this devil.

164
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:53,831
I must do something about it.”

165
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:58,214
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.

166
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:02,027
So, what He did was to

167
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:06,222
make him feel like going for the bathroom.

168
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,050
So he felt shy. He put the lady on one side

169
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:11,042
and he went to the bathroom.

170
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:17,095
Now, Shiva had warned him that,

171
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:20,025
"You'd better be careful, because this Mother Earth

172
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:22,822
is the mother of this lady,

173
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:25,105
and never put Her on the Mother Earth.

174
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:29,793
You must carry Him all the time on your back".

175
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:34,481
So when he reached a certain point,

176
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:38,818
Shri Krishna created a mischief and he felt like going.

177
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,959
 

178
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:44,212
So he put Her down. As soon as he put Her down,

179
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:50,032
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he didn't know what to do.

180
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:53,157
Second time again he tried.

181
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:57,280
And he again went to Shiva and he said,

182
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,608
"See now, this is what you have promised,

183
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,131
and this is what is doing".

184
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,272
So He said, "I had warned you that

185
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:07,256
Her brother is a very mischievous fellow

186
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,967
and He'll somehow or other manage,

187
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:15,115
so you'd better be careful. This time you don't listen to Him.

188
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:19,037
Don't put Her on the ground, whatever it may be".

189
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:27,582
So this time he did another try, we can say,

190
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:31,461
and carried Her on his back. Suddenly he found a little boy.

191
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,759
 

192
00:18:33,997 --> 00:18:39,015
It was Shri Krishna Himself laughing at him.

193
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,609
He said, ”Why are you laughing at me?”

194
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,023
"Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman on your back?

195
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,903
She has no ornaments". He said, “She's the Goddess.”

196
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:53,364
He said: “No. She has no ornaments. She's wearing nothing.

197
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,177
How can She be the Goddess?”

198
00:18:55,378 --> 00:19:00,426
So you see in India that's a ... proverb we use.

199
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,909
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives without any ornaments

200
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,245
or anything, that she's like the Lanka Parvati.

201
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,042
So he was carrying Her to Lanka.

202
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:14,034
And when he looked at Her up,

203
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:18,706
he saw a very old woman without any teeth, you know,

204
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,019
laughing at him. He got such a fright he threw Her away.

205
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,191
That's Mahamaya.

206
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:31,629
Then the third situation was, he went and told that,

207
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,567
"You better tell your wife that She's not to listen to anybody,

208
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,801
and you better see that you give me your wife itself".

209
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:42,574
He said, "Alright, She'll be born in Lanka and you can marry Her",

210
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:45,996
and Her name was Mandodari.

211
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,566
Now the great story goes on like that.

212
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:53,543
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper of Vishnu,

213
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:59,504
and at the time when Rama came, you see, to kill him -

214
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:04,199
all this was organized by Mandodari Herself.

215
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,293
Because She knew that if Shri Ram kills Ravana,

216
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:15,645
he will get his liberation from these ideas about women -

217
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,369
the way he was running after Sita

218
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:21,159
and doing all these things.

219
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:25,239
She actually wanted that something should happen that

220
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,333
he should take another birth, and he should get rid of these

221
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:34,999
notions of looking after beautiful women

222
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:38,973
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

223
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:42,043
She was against it completely, but he would not listen.

224
00:20:42,244 --> 00:20:49,309
So the war took place, and in the war he was killed by Shri Rama.

225
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,825
All this episode came

226
00:20:52,026 --> 00:21:03,384
because of the unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

227
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:07,386
His compassion is,

228
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:11,245
to look at, looks very illogical sometimes,

229
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:13,979
but there's a big logic behind it.

230
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,229
The logic is that whatever He does

231
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:27,432
brings forth a kind of a solution of the problem.

232
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,988
For example, there was a war on,

233
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:34,894
and the war was going on,

234
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:40,680
and that time there was a problem

235
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,813
because there was one horrible devil

236
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:49,516
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva.

237
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:53,188
That nobody can kill you.

238
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:58,555
He had given, also, blessings that they call ‘Vardaan’

239
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:01,606
to another saint, who said,

240
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:06,340
"I want to sleep now and nobody should disturb me".

241
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,883
So he was given a blessing -

242
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:11,836
anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

243
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:14,945
you can just look at that person and that will be…

244
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,383
he'll be reduced to ashes.

245
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,539
So these two now…

246
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,382
when the war started, you see, Shri Krishna thought,

247
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:33,326
best thing is to kill this devil with the same blessings

248
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,865
that the saint has got –

249
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:37,881
so He played.

250
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:43,389
And He started running away from the battlefield,

251
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:51,110
and that's why He's called as a

252
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:57,321
as a warrior who has ran out of the field – ‘Ranchordas’ -

253
00:22:57,522 --> 00:23:02,740
the one who runs away out of the field of battle.

254
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:08,930
And when He was running, He was wearing a shawl - Shri Krishna.

255
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:12,201
He just stealthily entered into the cave

256
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,795
where this another saint was sleeping

257
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:18,936
and put His shawl on top of that.

258
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:24,405
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

259
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:29,303
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was following Him,

260
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:34,331
this satanic fellow, he reached that place .

261
00:23:34,532 --> 00:23:38,065
and saw the same shawl

262
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:41,477
and he said, "Oh, so now you are tired

263
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:44,844
and now you are sleeping here. I'll put you right,"

264
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:47,828
without realizing who was sleeping.

265
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,247
And he pulled the shawl,

266
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:57,015
and here the sleeping saint gets up and looks at him,

267
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,765
and they say with his third eye he burnt (him).

268
00:24:00,966 --> 00:24:03,210
So the solution came in

269
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:07,601
So the whole play is like this, of three forces going on,

270
00:24:07,802 --> 00:24:11,757
just to show ultimately the truth prevails.

271
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:19,015
First is the Shiva's compassion, His goodness, to one side.

272
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:23,492
Then the play of Shri Krishna, or say Shri Vishnu,

273
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:28,758
of neutralising it;

274
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:35,758
and the third is the play of

275
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:41,024
Brahma who creates things and who produces things.

276
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:44,719
All these three forces are playing,

277
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,757
just to create an atmosphere for all of us to feel that

278
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:55,766
there is something else is to be done to our human awareness.

279
00:24:55,967 --> 00:25:03,732
All they have evolved within us this desire to seek the truth.

280
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:09,578
Now, on one side Shiva is extremely compassionate,

281
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:14,383
very kind even to Asuras, the rakshasas.

282
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:20,664
But on the other side He can be extremely cruel.

283
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:24,703
He can destroy the whole Universe.

284
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:28,601
If the people are so decadent,

285
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:36,687
if the people do not take to spirituality,

286
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:40,976
if their innocence is completely lost,

287
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:46,848
if they do not get detached from all these wrong identifications

288
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:50,239
which are creating problems in this world,

289
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,583
He destroys the whole Universe.

290
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:57,376
So, as it is, He is the spectator of the work of Adi Shakti.

291
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,279
 

292
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:04,227
He allows Her to do all this work, to create human beings,

293
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:07,477
to give them realization, do all this.

294
00:26:07,678 --> 00:26:11,937
But in case He finds Her children,

295
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:16,016
people who have been saved by Her,

296
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:18,352
are misbehaving

297
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:22,711
or insulting or in any way destroying Her work,

298
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,955
He might get into a temper

299
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:29,771
by which He can destroy the whole Universe.

300
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,281
But I don't think now there's any chance for Him to do that,

301
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:38,367
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

302
00:26:38,568 --> 00:26:42,914
But what I find among Sahaja Yogis is this,

303
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:47,445
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow very fast.

304
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,153
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their principle of Shiva Tatwa.

305
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:55,119
 

306
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,908
The first achievement shows that from inside

307
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:03,132
they start getting detached.

308
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:07,089
Now, detachment is not mental. It's not mental.

309
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,993
It is not that we have to take to some sort of a Sanyasa

310
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,611
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up our families and all that.

311
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:17,559
 

312
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:21,931
But the detachment is within oneself.

313
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:25,892
When that detachment starts working,

314
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:31,142
the first sign is that we become joyous.

315
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:33,767
We become happy.

316
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:38,712
Now if you ask anyone, "Why are you unhappy?”,

317
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:45,657
he'll talk about his wife, maybe his house, maybe his children,

318
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:53,037
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever it is.

319
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,398
So he gets absolutely upset,

320
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:04,474
or maybe very unhappy to see things happening around him.

321
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:08,499
Now [if] he is a realized soul -

322
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,140
this unhappiness is not going to help.

323
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:15,677
What is needed is, now,

324
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:23,491
to know that you can correct all these ills of the society,

325
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:30,227
of the family, of the whole country by transforming others,

326
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:34,110
not by feeling bad. But while doing that,

327
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:39,649
the main thing that you should have is a complete detachment.

328
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,902
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja Yoga

329
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:46,836
how people told Me about their own countrymen, country fellows.

330
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:49,519
 

331
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:52,428
I was amazed how they told Me about their own religions,

332
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:54,199
 

333
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,662
how wrong things they are doing.

334
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,631
I didn't know so much as they told Me,

335
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:04,404
and I thought that this is a detachment that has come

336
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:08,482
that they can see clearly what's wrong -

337
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:16,686
what's wrong with my society, with my people,

338
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:20,940
with my relations, with my family, with my country,

339
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,932
with the whole world.

340
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:28,235
But is only possible if you are not identified

341
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:33,520
to any one of them. Otherwise you will never see the defects.

342
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,799
You'll never see what's wrong with that person.

343
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,674
You can never even see the chakras which are catching.

344
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:45,158
So, the first thing that should happen is detachment.

345
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,603
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

346
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:53,314
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how do you get detached?”

347
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:56,970
Because I am not attached you see, so I'm already detached -

348
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,470
I don't know how to do that way.

349
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:02,900
But for you people I would say,

350
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:08,338
to understand yourself, you should introspect.

351
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,467
Try to find out to what thing am I attached.

352
00:30:12,668 --> 00:30:16,506
Why am I miserable? For whom am I worried?

353
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:18,279
Why should I worry?

354
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:22,771
Some things, you see, which were never very important,

355
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,630
they become very important to certain Sahaja Yogis.

356
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:33,670
For example, I was told that in the West people don't care

357
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:36,561
so much for their children. But as soon as they get realization

358
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:46,444
they just get attached to their children like as if it's some glue.

359
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,632
They cannot think what is good for their children.

360
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:56,984
Everything about children they think is their primary duty.

361
00:30:57,185 --> 00:31:01,923
The other day I was surprised when they told me that

362
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:07,540
it's the parents who want to come after the Birthday Puja.

363
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,204
I was shocked.

364
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:13,079
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja

365
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,186
and why should the parents want to come after that?

366
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:23,365
When I told Yogi he said, "Mother, we'll be very happy

367
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:25,592
if they are here, and they should be".

368
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:28,522
He said "It will help the children, it will help the parents".

369
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:32,210
But the whole, now, attention goes to the children -

370
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,413
that we must leave the children there

371
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:40,356
and we must look after them, and that's the only thing.

372
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,257
So the attachment to children

373
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,603
will definitely make you do such things,

374
00:31:48,804 --> 00:31:53,161
which are not good - not good for you.

375
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:56,174
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja Yoga,

376
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,729
I’ve seen - very common.

377
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,432
Then, another attachment is, say, to your family.

378
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:06,791
Normally, there are no such things in the West.

379
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,314
People are not attached to their family much, you see.

380
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:12,642
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

381
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:17,840
Suddenly they become self-realized

382
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,320
and it's like a boomerang, they come back to the family.

383
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:28,444
You see, so attached to the family, attached to the house,

384
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:32,717
attached to everything. I just can't understand.

385
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:37,511
If you are becoming the Pure Spirit then you are detached,

386
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:40,424
because you are just a reflection,

387
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,463
but the reflection of God Almighty.

388
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:47,776
All these identifications drop out.

389
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,452
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

390
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,171
I've never dropped them.

391
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:53,147
But still I can suggest certain things, which you can try.

392
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:55,600
 

393
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:59,398
First is meditation.

394
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,156
You should discover about yourself, what's wrong with you,

395
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:07,719
which side is catching - is it right or left side?

396
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,417
With meditation you can find out.

397
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,999
Are you attached to money,

398
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:16,586
are you attached to business, are you attached to your family,

399
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:24,490
are you attached to your country in a way which is not Sahaj,

400
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,739
or to your culture which is not Sahaj.

401
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,934
Then try to get rid of this attachment by meditation.

402
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:40,254
You know how to get rid of the right and the left.

403
00:33:40,455 --> 00:33:44,402
This attachment will show on your fingertips,

404
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:49,386
and you have to see for yourself what centers you are catching,

405
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:52,199
in which way are you in trouble.

406
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,893
And then you can clarify it

407
00:33:56,094 --> 00:34:01,823
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj treatment.

408
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:08,136
I think here we fail, that once we get attached to something

409
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,574
we don't even think we are getting attached.

410
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:12,457
We think we are doing very great thing

411
00:34:12,658 --> 00:34:16,277
because now we love this person, love that person -

412
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:20,582
Shiva's qualities, the compassion part.

413
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:26,926
You start getting attached to people. That is no compassion.

414
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,059
That is no compassion of any kind,

415
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,388
to be attached to any such things is no compassion,

416
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,411
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva.

417
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:39,777
Though people think it is the Shiva's compassion

418
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:44,605
that is working within us - it's not,

419
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:51,837
because that compassion is very pure.

420
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,646
It is like, as I've told you many a times,

421
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:58,365
it's like the sap in the tree which rises

422
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:02,615
and goes to various parts of the tree,

423
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:07,795
and then either it evaporates or goes down into Mother Earth.

424
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:11,990
It's not attached. If it gets attached to one flower,

425
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:17,010
or to one leaf, or to one fruit

426
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:24,040
then the whole tree will suffer and also the flower will disappear.

427
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:27,802
So this kind of attachment to a particular thing,

428
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:33,068
to a particular idea is not proper.

429
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:39,596
In Sahaja Yoga I've found people are very adaptable

430
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:42,932
and understand what they should do,

431
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:46,346
but the main thing is meditation.

432
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:50,136
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva Tatwa,

433
00:35:50,337 --> 00:35:54,489
on the principle of Shiva, you can definitely detach,

434
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,005
and then the joy will be the maximum,

435
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:01,575
joy will be the maximum.

436
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:05,083
I've seen people have interest in, say, food

437
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:12,239
or in clothes or in house, anything.

438
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,630
You can have interest, you should have interest,

439
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:20,246
but in that interest there should be enlightenment -

440
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:24,785
that you cannot get attached to it.

441
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:29,629
Some people, say, who are, say, from South India,

442
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,067
they don't like North Indian food.

443
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:35,810
Those who are from North India don't like South Indian.

444
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:39,990
It's a big problem. I asked the people in Indian Airlines:

445
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:42,420
"Why don't you have some standard food?”

446
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:45,363
He said: "What is the standard food of India? Tell me".

447
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:48,692
It was a (good) question. Indians are very particular

448
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:50,980
about the taste and food.

449
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:56,285
So, it's a fact we don't have any standard food in India.

450
00:36:56,486 --> 00:36:59,699
But in the same way, we can say in so many other ways

451
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,512
that in the West people run after things

452
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:09,270
which are not necessary.

453
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:14,262
They do things just out of fashion or, I don't know,

454
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:17,473
because their personality is not grown up.

455
00:37:17,674 --> 00:37:23,356
If your personality is grown up then you see everything,

456
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:28,364
everything from an angle which is much higher than others,

457
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:31,114
and you don't get dissolved with others.

458
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,911
What you know is much higher,

459
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:37,114
much greater and much more joy giving.

460
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:40,208
Now these attachments, people think that

461
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,959
it's very joy giving.

462
00:37:42,151 --> 00:37:47,177
If you get a child and if you have, say, a wife,

463
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:51,107
everything, are joy-giving. It's a very wrong idea.

464
00:37:51,308 --> 00:37:55,834
The joy comes from your own source of your Spirit.

465
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:58,186
Whether your husband is good,

466
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:02,499
whether your children are good or bad, whatever they are,

467
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,444
they cannot give you joy.

468
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:08,759
It's only you can enjoy your Self,

469
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:14,840
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

470
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,687
When nobody can harm you,

471
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:21,210
then whom are you going to be angry with?

472
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:24,525
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

473
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:26,828
is that He’s extremely forgiving. He goes up to a point,

474
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:32,937
till He destroys the whole work of Adi Shakti.

475
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:36,492
But otherwise He’s very, very forgiving,

476
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:40,695
and He also is very balanced about it.

477
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:44,736
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with the whole world -

478
00:38:44,937 --> 00:38:49,345
was so decadent and all that and She started destroying everything.

479
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:52,593
So He put a little child under Her feet,

480
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:56,131
and such a big tongue came out with such a shock,

481
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,756
She stopped Her destruction.

482
00:38:59,957 --> 00:39:04,170
So His ways are such that a person,

483
00:39:04,371 --> 00:39:10,561
who is to develop the Shiva principle within himself,

484
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:14,186
should be extremely forgiving.

485
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:16,679
I know there are people who are very cruel, who are very torturesome.

486
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:23,873
If you cannot bear it, all right, finish it off.

487
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:27,798
I'll stand by you there; but if you can bear it,

488
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:34,387
is better to bear, and undergo this experience of bearing it,

489
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:39,919
because it's not difficult to bear than to get out of it.

490
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,619
For example, a lady came to me, and she said:

491
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,689
"I'm going to divorce my husband". I said: "Why?"

492
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,752
"Because he comes home very late and I get very little of him".

493
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,528
But I said, "When you divorce you'll not get him

494
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:54,719
at all.

495
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:58,411
What's the logic? At least now you see him, whatever it is,

496
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,670
whenever, whatever the time is there.

497
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:02,759
But this is no solution.

498
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:06,169
If you divorce him, you'll never see him.

499
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,169
So what's the use of such a divorce?"

500
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,335
So many things like that can be understood

501
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,546
once you are a detached person,

502
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,702
that you are not to be attached to anything.

503
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:24,436
Now who can aggress you if you are not attached to anyone?

504
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:26,006
Nobody can. Only thing, when you feel that you have to protest,

505
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,608
you should, but with detachment.

506
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,180
In protest also is important

507
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:40,391
to absolutely to have a complete detachment.

508
00:40:40,592 --> 00:40:47,726
Now, the main problem before us, today, is something else.

509
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:54,069
Is that we all have to ascend,

510
00:40:54,270 --> 00:41:01,402
and ascend with equal strength.

511
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:12,012
There's a story about some birds who were caught in a net,

512
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:16,223
so they decided that we should get out of this net,

513
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:19,723
and they tried. Everybody tried to get out.

514
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:23,012
But nobody, individually, could work it out.

515
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:27,926
So they all decided to fly together, "One, two, three and go,"

516
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:31,973
and they took all that net with them.

517
00:41:32,174 --> 00:41:36,435
And they said… then they requested the rats that

518
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:44,997
"Please come and cut our net", and they were freed.

519
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:49,200
So, if it can happen between the rats and the birds,

520
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:51,772
why not between us?

521
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:54,231
So, in collectivity… you'll be amazed in the collectivity

522
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:56,919
 

523
00:41:57,106 --> 00:42:02,225
how we could be helpful and joyous with each other.

524
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:05,084
Now, say something is wrong

525
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:09,631
with your mother, father, sisters, somebody. Doesn't matter.

526
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:13,509
After all you have the Ocean of Joy here with the collectivity

527
00:42:13,509 --> 00:42:14,793
 

528
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:16,600
and your problems can be solved,

529
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:21,155
if collectively if you want to solve your problem.

530
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:24,624
So, we have to depend on the collectivity;

531
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:25,896
Very much to be one with the collective.

532
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:28,280
 

533
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:33,694
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

534
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:36,702
the joy itself draws you together.

535
00:42:36,903 --> 00:42:40,421
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing.

536
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:43,163
We have had so many experiences of that,

537
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:46,875
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how happy they were

538
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:52,063
to find Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,

539
00:42:52,264 --> 00:42:54,696
and how they felt happy.

540
00:42:54,897 --> 00:42:57,946
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis

541
00:42:58,147 --> 00:43:04,813
is really the most joyous channel,

542
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:09,211
and that is what is the source, we should say,

543
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:12,078
of our becoming one together.

544
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:16,747
Once you start enjoying each other...

545
00:43:17,373 --> 00:43:21,336
I've told you once a story of a great poet in India,

546
00:43:21,537 --> 00:43:26,258
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

547
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:32,656
And there was another one who was a…

548
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:37,258
potter. Sometimes I miss out in English words.

549
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:41,961
This potter was another poet

550
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:47,240
and he was called as Gora Khumhar.

551
00:43:47,678 --> 00:43:50,704
So, when Namdeva went to meet him -

552
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:54,087
a saint only feels like meeting a saint -

553
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:59,243
looked at him, and he just stood back

554
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:02,485
and then he said a beautiful couplet.

555
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:09,274
He says that, “I came here to see the formless - Chaitanya,

556
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:14,477
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

557
00:44:14,678 --> 00:44:17,563
“Nirgunachya bheti alo sagunashi”.

558
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:22,641
I came to see the formless, to see the vibrations,

559
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:27,407
but here it is in the form that I see it".

560
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:31,813
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

561
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:35,859
This kind of appreciation, this subtle appreciation

562
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,312
is only possible between the two saints,

563
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,296
or between the many.

564
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:46,171
They don't see [that] he was kneading the clay;

565
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:52,163
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing that work.

566
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:54,397
He never saw all these things.

567
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:57,694
He never saw his body, face or anything,

568
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:04,848
but he saw that, the Divinity personified in him.

569
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:11,887
This sensitivity of feeling for other Sahaja Yogis

570
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:16,684
should really develop within you.

571
00:45:16,885 --> 00:45:22,278
Then you won't care for nonsensical, superficial things.

572
00:45:22,479 --> 00:45:28,161
And this is one of the great principles of Shiva.

573
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:33,802
He doesn't bother. Now see, His hair are all matted up,

574
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:40,083
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both the legs like that

575
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:44,888
going for His wedding – can you imagine?

576
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:48,580
And all His friends, all His followers are…

577
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:53,494
somebody has only one eye, another has only one hand,

578
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:56,486
one is bent like that,

579
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:04,119
because for Him the outside personality doesn't matter.

580
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:08,895
What matters is the spirituality.

581
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:13,036
Whether you have one eye or whether you have a crooked body

582
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:14,778
makes no difference to Him.

583
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:20,255
To Him all of them are His own people,

584
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:26,005
because nothing that is superficial attracts His attention

585
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:30,091
but the divinity in a person.

586
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:35,294
We have so many ways of understanding His principle

587
00:46:35,495 --> 00:46:39,169
because He’s all pervading.

588
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,388
If you feel compassion for someone,

589
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:46,326
it works. It definitely works.

590
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:51,764
Recently there was a case of some sort of a

591
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:57,842
incurable disease in Mexico.

592
00:46:58,043 --> 00:46:58,780
And the lady, who was Mexican, who was working in the UN -

593
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,080
 

594
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,303
she's still working in UN -

595
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:06,170
she wrote to Me two letters, that

596
00:47:06,371 --> 00:47:09,436
“Mother, I'm going to lose my son

597
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:13,334
because he has this horrible disease”.

598
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,904
I mean, just she wrote to Me.

599
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:20,365
I just felt such compassion for her,

600
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:25,326
because she wrote a letter which brought tears to My eyes.

601
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:30,894
And imagine, those tears have cured that boy,

602
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:47,143
has cured that boy completely,

603
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:54,612
and she wrote Me a letter of thanking and all.

604
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:59,879
I was amazed, because My compassion is not mental,

605
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,682
it just works, it's just there, just flows and works it out.

606
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:05,959
 

607
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:10,051
In the same way, you can also become that.

608
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:13,347
I want you to have all My powers.

609
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:16,439
But first is the compassion.

610
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:20,098
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another person, anyone,

611
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:23,762
whether he's a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja Yogi, that's not important.

612
00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:29,614
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

613
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:35,333
If you say even he's a non-Sahaja Yogi,

614
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:39,185
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

615
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:45,896
That's not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi is different.

616
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,826
Like the other day somebody said, I said,

617
00:48:48,027 --> 00:48:49,027
"You are very hot-tempered".

618
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:52,823
"Yes, yes, I am. When somebody provokes me".

619
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,475
I said, "Everybody when he's provoked only gets angry.

620
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:01,038
Only the mad people are such who do not get angry

621
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,640
even if they are provoked”, you see.

622
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,515
So, if you get angry when you are provoked,

623
00:49:06,716 --> 00:49:10,179
is nothing so great. Everybody gets angry like that,

624
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,499
when you are provoked. But if you say that if you are not provoked

625
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,358
then you will not get angry, that sort of a state is very different.

626
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:17,559
 

627
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:26,804
So, what I find (is) that in the whole atmosphere of today,

628
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:36,514
in the modern times, there's a big struggle going on

629
00:49:36,715 --> 00:49:40,975
which is not Shiva's culture.

630
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:48,707
Shiva's culture is the, I should say, the Sahaj culture.

631
00:49:49,766 --> 00:49:57,646
If you are Sahaja Yogis, you should have compassion in you,

632
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:02,842
understanding of others' feelings;

633
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:08,686
and also you should have readiness to look after

634
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:12,827
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja Yogis,

635
00:50:13,028 --> 00:50:16,975
then your compassion will become effective.

636
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:21,608
Now, as you know today the biggest problem

637
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:25,765
of today's civilization

638
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:29,617
is that Western culture has gone to dogs.

639
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,138
They are going… I mean, when you read the newspaper

640
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,130
you are shocked the way things are happening.

641
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:38,997
I don't know how many will realize it

642
00:50:39,198 --> 00:50:42,872
before their destruction. It's really self-destructing.

643
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:49,423
On one side this is the self-indulgent and permissive society

644
00:50:49,624 --> 00:50:51,228
which is working.

645
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:56,069
Now on the other side I find the Islamic culture

646
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,869
is trying to oppose it.

647
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:03,807
That's correct. They are trying to oppose it is correct.

648
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:07,784
But the way they are opposing is creating problems.

649
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:11,682
If you oppress somebody - "Don't do this, don't do that" -

650
00:51:11,883 --> 00:51:15,448
then they'll do it much more. I'll give you the example,

651
00:51:15,649 --> 00:51:20,128
that if you go into the north of India

652
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:23,042
the culture is more Islamic,

653
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:26,214
and the people are very licentious

654
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:30,917
and all the time looking at women and… not all, but many.

655
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:34,136
Though they are, say they are Hindus or they say this and that.

656
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:37,550
But still they have all these bad habits

657
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:41,120
which have come from the Islamic suppression.

658
00:51:41,321 --> 00:51:44,995
When a woman is completely covered

659
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:49,011
and nobody can see her, they become much more curious.

660
00:51:49,212 --> 00:51:52,355
I have some people who came to Bombay

661
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:54,683
and somebody was travelling with Me and

662
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:56,964
he was looking at every woman on the street. I said,

663
00:51:57,165 --> 00:52:00,962
“Your neck will break now, the way you are going on”.

664
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:03,150
But is a common practice there.

665
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:06,447
Not only that, but this curiosity goes too far

666
00:52:06,648 --> 00:52:09,588
and people can become extremely immoral,

667
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,432
just like we are in the West.

668
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:20,951
So, the suppression of your desires is also wrong.

669
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:27,191
Also, this culture which outwardly suppresses

670
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:31,668
but inwardly people are very immoral.

671
00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:35,316
Once I was traveling from Riyadh to London

672
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:37,881
and I went off to sleep. When I got up,

673
00:52:38,082 --> 00:52:39,785
I saw some other people sitting there

674
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:42,727
all very nicely dressed up with short skirts

675
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:47,235
and men with all the bow ties and this and that.

676
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,821
So I asked the airhostess “Did we stop somewhere?”

677
00:52:50,022 --> 00:52:51,874
She said: “No, no, we have been going directly”.

678
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:55,569
I said: “Then who are these people?” “Same”.

679
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,608
“They are so much changed.” I mean, I was surprised

680
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,260
that they were wearing such long, these chadur and all that,

681
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:06,658
and now here they are with all these funny dresses.

682
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:10,580
I couldn't understand. That's what happened.

683
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:17,088
The curiosity created by suppression also is not helpful.

684
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:19,387
In Sahaja Yoga there's no question of suppression.

685
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:23,332
You become innocent, just become innocent.

686
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,277
That is the principle of Shiva.

687
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:28,841
This Sahaj culture is in the center.

688
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:33,863
Neither too much of licentiousness nor too much of suppression,

689
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:40,011
but it is in the center, which is the Shiva's greatest principle -

690
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:45,394
is to be innocent. And this innocence just shines in you.

691
00:53:45,595 --> 00:53:47,683
I have seen it. You people,

692
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:51,964
whatever you might have done before, but I see you are so pure.

693
00:53:52,165 --> 00:53:56,534
You don't have these stupid ideas of

694
00:53:56,735 --> 00:54:01,362
behaving in a manner that is so Western.

695
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:03,893
Also, so many Islamic people I've seen

696
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:05,713
who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

697
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:09,940
have become very, very Sahaj

698
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:14,167
and are leading a very good life.

699
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:17,045
We have some Iranians who sent Me letters of their confessions,

700
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,959
 

701
00:54:20,149 --> 00:54:22,049
and I was shocked. I never read them

702
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,040
because it was too much for Me. And now I find them to be

703
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:28,759
the most moral people that way.

704
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,067
So going to one extreme is wrong, or to another is wrong.

705
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:36,684
But to be in the center, in the Sahaj,

706
00:54:36,885 --> 00:54:39,442
is the best way to understand -

707
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:44,387
what is so important for life is morality.

708
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:47,645
And that comes from your innocence.

709
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:53,215
And that is the quality of -of course Shri Ganesha,

710
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,403
who is the Son of Shiva,

711
00:54:55,604 --> 00:55:04,005
but is emitted through the innocence of Shri Shiva.

712
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:09,903
Now, I think in next lecture of Shiva

713
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,801
I'll talk about innocence to you,

714
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:18,059
but for this one you have to understand the detachment -

715
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,676
The detachment that should evolve within.

716
00:55:21,877 --> 00:55:24,582
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

717
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:27,652
you can develop that detachment within you,

718
00:55:27,853 --> 00:55:30,683
which will be really joy giving.

719
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:34,128
So many qualities of Shiva can be described,

720
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:40,071
and I think in so many lectures I have told you about Him.

721
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:44,316
I have to just say that

722
00:55:44,517 --> 00:55:50,371
you should have also collective meditation in your ashrams.

723
00:55:50,572 --> 00:55:55,246
Will be a good idea if you can try collective meditation,

724
00:55:55,447 --> 00:55:58,746
will be nice. But you don't have to give vibrations to anyone.

725
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:02,324
You don't have to look after the chakras of others.

726
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,433
You just bother, yourself, what's wrong with you.

727
00:56:05,634 --> 00:56:08,363
And now whatever is the solution

728
00:56:08,564 --> 00:56:10,707
for your ascent you should do it,

729
00:56:10,908 --> 00:56:16,254
because the responsibility of the whole world

730
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:18,465
rests on Sahaja Yogis.

731
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:23,278
This you know, that there's no way out without Sahaja Yoga.

732
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:28,591
To save humanity from all kinds of problems,

733
00:56:28,792 --> 00:56:31,833
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

734
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:35,755
So it is your responsibility to keep yourself

735
00:56:35,956 --> 00:56:39,943
in proper shape, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

736
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:43,490
Get rid of your left and get rid of your right,

737
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,474
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga,

738
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,662
not by bombastic words or aggressiveness,

739
00:56:50,863 --> 00:56:53,889
but with love and compassion.

740
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:57,569
I'm sure we have done a lot, we have achieved a lot,

741
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:01,475
but there are still some points here and there

742
00:57:01,676 --> 00:57:05,678
which is a very unpleasant task for Me to correct them.

743
00:57:05,879 --> 00:57:10,459
But whatever it is I have to say that it's working,

744
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,545
and everybody should look at themselves

745
00:57:14,746 --> 00:57:17,624
and feel happy from where they have come here,

746
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:19,718
and how far we have to go.

747
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:23,426
May God bless you all.
