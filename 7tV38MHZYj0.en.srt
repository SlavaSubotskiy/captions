1
00:00:04,883 --> 00:00:08,050
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:13,383
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

3
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:23,050
that he is the incarnation of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,009
to begin with but then he was given to Shri Radhaji

5
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:33,550
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

6
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,800
this great incarnation of Christ.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,092
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

8
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:46,717
how there can be a immaculate conception because they have no sense at all,

9
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:50,383
no sensitivity at all to spiritual life.

10
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,175
We Indians can understand it,

11
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:55,259
is very easy for Indians to understand

12
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,175
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

13
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,633
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

14
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,967
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

15
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,299
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

16
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:12,259
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

17
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:16,883
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

18
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:22,550
with this limited brain they had, and the whole religion in the name of Christ

19
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:28,550
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

20
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:37,508
that it's unbelievable. His purity, his holiness, his auspiciousness

21
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,717
is never understood in the west I think.

22
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:47,717
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

23
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:52,383
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

24
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:58,967
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

25
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,800
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

26
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:03,675
those who are the followers of Christ

27
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:08,508
should have the greatest amount of morality.

28
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:16,466
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

29
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:21,717
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

30
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:29,842
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing he has said it,

31
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:35,633
and just think in the west people could not follow it

32
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,299
because the whole religion got perverted

33
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:46,092
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

34
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:49,259
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

35
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,425
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

36
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:56,092
is still going on, in India also all over,

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,383
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

38
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:05,092
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

39
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:09,425
The first and foremost thing he has said

40
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:16,717
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

41
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,967
that you must be born again.

42
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,633
So it's all mental, you are born again,

43
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:26,134
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

44
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:32,299
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

45
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:40,758
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

46
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:43,175
I think is another crucifixion.

47
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:47,883
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

48
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:51,259
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

49
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,092
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:03:55,092 --> 00:04:05,925
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

51
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:12,758
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,550
So this brain trust business might be all right

53
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,591
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

54
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:24,050
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

55
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,383
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

56
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:35,675
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

57
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,633
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

58
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:47,883
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

59
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:54,217
which has to be opened out because with the brain

60
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,425
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

61
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:04,217
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

62
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,009
not so much from animals brain. You can see

63
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,842
if you go to any forest it's clean, nice smelling,

64
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:18,466
so well but put one human being there and you will know

65
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:23,591
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

66
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:32,425
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

67
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:38,717
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

68
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:48,967
So we must understand Christ in the right sense, he is the eternal child,

69
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:54,550
he is the innocence itself, he's the source of innocence

70
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:59,633
and he is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

71
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:04,092
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians,

72
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:08,675
you should be very proud that oh she's talking about Christ,

73
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:13,050
many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

74
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,299
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

75
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:28,758
Now one has to understand that how Christ in his miraculous life

76
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:33,217
has shown so many miracles. First of all his birth was immaculate.

77
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,883
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

78
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:41,134
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

79
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:45,050
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

80
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,591
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

81
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,383
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

82
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:54,259
they are divine and we should understand

83
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:58,134
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

84
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:04,633
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

85
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:12,009
They are much beyond us. So for the western mind

86
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,675
it is important to understand that the life of Christ

87
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:21,591
was such a blessing for them that they have lost it,

88
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:25,591
they have wasted it and they have never understood how to respect it.

89
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:36,134
The whole thing became like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

90
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:46,259
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

91
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,800
that Christ was Ganesha and he was the logos,

92
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:55,550
he was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

93
00:07:55,591 --> 00:08:03,009
By looking at your left side from the right side,

94
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:08,550
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

95
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,550
because it is made of carbon atom.

96
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:16,842
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

97
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:23,925
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

98
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:29,508
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

99
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,633
and now we have made the animation,

100
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:33,508
we have no arrangement to show you there,

101
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,717
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

102
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:40,299
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

103
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,550
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

104
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,591
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

105
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,633
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

106
00:08:54,675 --> 00:09:03,883
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

107
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:08,508
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

108
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:17,050
and then it is important we must pray to his incarnation that is Christ.

109
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:23,758
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

110
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:30,050
because he is the source, he is the potential of Christ.

111
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,175
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

112
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:39,925
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

113
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,967
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

114
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:48,092
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

115
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:51,383
and on his birthday today we have to decide

116
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:56,259
that he has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

117
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:00,134
that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

118
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:04,508
At that time of his time I didn't know that anybody knew

119
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:09,009
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

120
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:13,842
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

121
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:17,217
in long time and that's why these symbols

122
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,299
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

123
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:28,299
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

124
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:32,675
we can prove so many things all tangible;

125
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:36,259
how Christ used to cure people, what did he do,

126
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:41,883
it's all tangible, we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

127
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:47,009
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

128
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,425
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

129
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:59,300
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

130
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:03,883
I told them not to put up any stalls here

131
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:07,800
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:13,299
Once Christ saw like that and he took a hunter and hit all of them,

133
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,883
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

134
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:23,633
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

135
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:28,550
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

136
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,758
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

137
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,800
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

138
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,383
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

139
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,717
and put up a stall and you all run about means

140
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:45,633
you are still hanging around with that thing,

141
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,800
you have come here for what?

142
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:56,967
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

143
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,299
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

144
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,758
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

145
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,425
which you always do outside also. But these people know

146
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:14,217
that you still have those weaknesses, that's why they have put up the stalls.

147
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:23,717
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

148
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:26,800
Last time all of you suffered because of that

149
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,925
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

150
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:34,299
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

151
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,591
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:42,300
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

153
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:50,134
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

154
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:54,842
from the very beginning, he was so confident of it

155
00:12:54,883 --> 00:13:02,217
that at the age of twelve years he went and talked to these parses,

156
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,967
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

157
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,217
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

158
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,675
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

159
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:18,883
but he went and argued with them at that young age

160
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,925
and he was just saying what are you doing here.

161
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:31,259
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

162
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,134
He was discussing and talking to them

163
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:40,299
but his parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

164
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,758
might kill him so they brought him to India,

165
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,883
he came to India for wisdom.

166
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,508
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

167
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,508
but must be this country was full of wisdom when he came

168
00:13:52,550 --> 00:14:00,299
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

169
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,967
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

170
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,633
that he met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

171
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,300
and he asked him what's your name?

172
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:20,299
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

173
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:24,967
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

174
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:33,009
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa, he said from what country do you come.

175
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,425
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

176
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:43,217
and this is my country. So this India, the Bharat,

177
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:51,092
the Hindustan was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

178
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:56,675
and feel inferior to other countries who have gone up materially higher,

179
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,383
you don't know where they are,

180
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:03,925
but we should be spiritually higher,

181
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:10,591
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

182
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,425
that means Christ recognised

183
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:16,758
that this country of spirituality is his own.

184
00:15:16,758 --> 00:15:22,383
So we belong to that country of spirituality

185
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:29,175
and not to the materialistic or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

186
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:43,341
In his life time which was so very short, whatever he has said,

187
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:47,758
every word is great but as I told you

188
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:55,508
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

189
00:15:55,508 --> 00:16:00,591
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

190
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,883
he has put them nicely.  Now recently I've got a book

191
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:10,800
which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

192
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:17,134
for about, till fifty years they discovered it, and this book is called

193
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:20,591
as the Library of Hamadhi. The place was called Hamadhi

194
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:24,175
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

195
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:29,967
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India he put all these things there, is very interesting.

196
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:35,299
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

197
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:39,299
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

198
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:45,925
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

199
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:49,341
very nicely. Was he mad to allow drinking?

200
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:55,717
How can he allow drinking

201
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:58,299
which goes against your awareness,

202
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,591
but they thought it was nice,

203
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:07,383
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

204
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,925
that you can drink in Christianity.

205
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:18,299
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion, you could have only once the Marriage.

206
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:24,383
So they have one marriage and ten keeps, is all right,

207
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,675
allowed, in the bible is written,

208
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:29,758
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

209
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,259
do what you like. No sense of morality

210
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:40,217
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

211
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,217
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

212
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:50,217
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

213
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:55,466
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

214
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,633
and then he establishes himself at Agnya,

215
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:04,009
but morality is the essence of his life,

216
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:10,050
what we call in India language his character.

217
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:18,800
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

218
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:23,717
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

219
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:27,758
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

220
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:33,341
I mean you cannot even believe it

221
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:36,925
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

222
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,383
that these so called advanced countries

223
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,425
are advancing towards what.

224
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:49,550
Impossible we cannot conceive it even, such an impurity,

225
00:18:49,550 --> 00:19:00,675
such a horrible, destructive immorality,

226
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:03,009
and I don't know from where it comes,

227
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,175
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

228
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:09,550
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

229
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:16,508
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

230
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,175
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

231
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:27,009
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

232
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,800
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

233
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:36,883
and you have to tell them this is all nonsense in the name of Christ,

234
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:44,383
in the name of God, you have to come up and talk about it,

235
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:49,009
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

236
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:54,134
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

237
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:58,675
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

238
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:02,299
some horrible cinema songs put up there

239
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:07,508
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

240
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,550
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

241
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:16,259
they are in that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

242
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:27,425
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for his auspiciousness.

243
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:31,717
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

244
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:36,134
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

245
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:40,341
as something so horrible which is also done

246
00:20:40,383 --> 00:20:45,134
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

247
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:49,550
Thank God one of them is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

248
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:56,591
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

249
00:20:56,633 --> 00:21:04,259
is a devotion to Mother. In that book the,

250
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:11,092
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

251
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:16,175
but this Paul objects to it,

252
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:22,466
and she says that this is what you have to achieve.

253
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:26,009
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

254
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:34,925
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

255
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:41,883
"behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

256
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:47,758
and how dare he insult her but just the opposite,

257
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:55,009
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

258
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:00,217
I mean he called her as just a woman.

259
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:04,717
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

260
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:11,134
Can you imagine, just a woman,

261
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:13,341
and a big controversy going on

262
00:22:13,383 --> 00:22:17,925
on these so called advanced people whether the women

263
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:21,134
should be ordained as priests or not.

264
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:23,466
We think we are very backward

265
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,842
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

266
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:31,009
We had.............

267
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,217
such people here and we respect the Mother

268
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:41,633
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her, the one who has created us,

269
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,591
she is the one who looks after us,

270
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:47,050
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

271
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,883
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

272
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:58,383
and supposed to be very advanced people,

273
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:04,675
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

274
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:13,550
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed

275
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,383
in the name of Christ.

276
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:24,425
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

277
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:28,717
he came on this earth. They can't believe

278
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:33,341
that he could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

279
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:36,175
that others could be non criminal.

280
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:45,591
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

281
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:52,009
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

282
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:57,675
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

283
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:04,925
If you are hankering after attracting other people

284
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,675
and charming other people and all that,

285
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:11,050
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

286
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,466
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

287
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:20,633
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

288
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:25,341
the light of Christ in your own life.

289
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:31,967
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how he lived.

290
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:38,341
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

291
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:43,675
but he stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

292
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:48,341
he stood up and said those who are not committed any sin

293
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:54,800
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

294
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:02,383
So not that only he was a pure personality but purity also

295
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,175
is expressed in truth and his compassion and love.

296
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:12,842
Such compassion he has expressed, such compassion.

297
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:17,217
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

298
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:22,299
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

299
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:29,092
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

300
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:34,967
he hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

301
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,175
aids, this, that, everything comes.

302
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:46,633
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

303
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:49,633
But Christ is compassionate, he forgives

304
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:53,800
because he believes that there could be a transformation.

305
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,758
At the level of Sri Ganesha he thinks is better

306
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:04,550
that let them be killed and be born again

307
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,800
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

308
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:10,967
that he can transform people,

309
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:15,717
but he could not, they crucified him.

310
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:21,134
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

311
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:26,550
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

312
00:26:26,591 --> 00:26:31,508
without any understanding about spirituality,

313
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,299
very insensitive to true knowledge.

314
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:45,758
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

315
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,508
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people nor it is meant for very smart ones.

316
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:58,883
Some people think they are very smart because they are successful in life,

317
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:03,092
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

318
00:27:03,134 --> 00:27:09,009
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

319
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,383
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

320
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:22,217
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

321
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:28,134
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

322
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:31,092
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

323
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:38,009
will inherit the blessing of Mother. You have to be meek,

324
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,758
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

325
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,466
because then you will see

326
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:48,800
where are we into this great cosmos,

327
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:55,675
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God,

328
00:27:55,717 --> 00:28:01,299
for what? How? How have we come here?

329
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,050
How have you entered here? So many tried,

330
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,800
thousands of years sacrificing this sacrificing that,

331
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:13,967
standing on their heads, fasting,

332
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,967
how is it suddenly we got this blessing?

333
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,217
How are we there?

334
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:24,758
When we start looking at this we become meek.

335
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:28,259
Is the blessing, is the grace.

336
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:30,758
It's not through our ego,

337
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,134
through our conditionings but is just the grace,

338
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:38,466
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

339
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:46,591
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

340
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:54,758
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

341
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:58,299
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

342
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,800
but those who have not known themselves

343
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:04,341
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

344
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:11,134
Tukarama has said in very simple words .............

345
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:17,050
the one who has known himself is the last one.

346
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,383
You can judge the chakras of others

347
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,508
but you can't judge your own chakras,

348
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,842
you can introspect others,

349
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:27,925
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

350
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,925
You know everything about others but about yourself

351
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:36,259
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

352
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,092
First thing you must know yourself.

353
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:41,175
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

354
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:43,591
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

355
00:29:43,591 --> 00:29:47,259
Even now people have so many conditionings.

356
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:50,591
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

357
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:59,217
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble and you have to be wise.

358
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:03,341
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

359
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:07,717
everything should express wisdom

360
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:11,633
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

361
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,341
from doing wrong things.

362
00:30:13,341 --> 00:30:16,050
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

363
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:20,341
falls at my feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

364
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:24,925
I may fall down or catches hold of my feet,

365
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:29,050
is all self oriented.

366
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:33,508
I should see Mother, I should go and meet her,

367
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:37,175
I touched her feet, is all ego.

368
00:30:37,217 --> 00:30:42,383
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

369
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:51,175
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back from there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

370
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:59,425
He doesn't want to see me, nothing, just like this, standing.

371
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:04,175
He doesn't force his way in any way.

372
00:31:04,217 --> 00:31:08,341
Mother is here.

373
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:14,466
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

374
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:18,425
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

375
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:21,633
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

376
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:24,259
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

377
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,925
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

378
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:31,217
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

379
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:36,758
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

380
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:41,550
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

381
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:49,842
It's impossible, how can a person who is supposed

382
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:53,300
to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

383
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:58,425
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

384
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:01,758
when he was himself a devil?

385
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,134
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

386
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:14,717
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

387
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:19,300
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

388
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:30,092
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

389
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:34,466
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

390
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:39,925
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

391
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,967
you are all protected from every angle

392
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:46,717
but if you want to hit yourself I can't help it.

393
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:49,591
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

394
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:55,550
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

395
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:01,341
First and foremost thing of introspectionis know thyself.

396
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:07,508
What you are doing,

397
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,550
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

398
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:19,967
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

399
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:27,092
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

400
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:30,259
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's.

401
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:37,425
So in your meditation you have to sit down

402
00:33:37,466 --> 00:33:40,717
and first of all introspect-Oh Christ,

403
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:45,259
Oh Sri Ganesha please give me wisdom to see myself

404
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:52,175
and understand what's wrong with me and understand

405
00:33:52,217 --> 00:33:59,717
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

406
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:07,299
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

407
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,299
because virtue within you gives you joy.

408
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,550
But you don't say I'm virtuous,

409
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:17,800
you don't say that, but the virtue within you

410
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:20,675
when you discover, that gives you joy

411
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:27,633
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

412
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,299
your lust and greed, no it does not.

413
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:38,967
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

414
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:44,092
people think how I can use it for say fame,

415
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:49,967
leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

416
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,842
why not use it for making some money some how.

417
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,383
Some sort of a business they start.

418
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:02,591
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

419
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,633
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

420
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:08,175
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

421
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:14,466
Sahaja Yoga is only Gods business, that's all.

422
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:24,717
Everything that you are doing is for God and that's why

423
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,883
you are doing it for your self.

424
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:30,425
So introspection is very important,

425
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:35,591
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

426
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,800
and laughing at yourself is the best.

427
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:39,175
I laugh at myself many a times

428
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:42,717
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

429
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:51,383
that makes life so interesting. That will kill your ego.

430
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:57,591
How I am trying to assert myself and where is the meekness

431
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:03,883
that Christ has talked about. It is a natural goodness within us.

432
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:11,967
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

433
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:14,633
Whether you are sitting here near me or there

434
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:17,633
I know who is that kind.

435
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:23,299
My heart just opens for such a personality.

436
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:34,633
I know who they are. But even if I know I will never tell you,

437
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:38,466
it is better that you know yourself.

438
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:43,758
"Know thyself" is his message,

439
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,800
in the real way not with deception because you are deceiving yourself,

440
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,550
whom are you deceiving, know thyself without any deception,

441
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:04,842
without any lies, with full concentration,

442
00:37:04,842 --> 00:37:12,092
see where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

443
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:15,758
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

444
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:20,883
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

445
00:37:20,883 --> 00:37:23,800
Exactly this what Christ has said,

446
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:27,842
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

447
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:33,842
Then he has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very,

448
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:38,299
very big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

449
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:43,425
because you are collective, those who are not collective

450
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:47,217
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

451
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:49,508
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

452
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:53,009
but as soon as you become collective,

453
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:57,259
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

454
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:00,925
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

455
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,299
I am so overjoyed to see that

456
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:06,925
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

457
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:12,299
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

458
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:15,299
but also individually within yourself

459
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,466
you have to improve for your own goodness.

460
00:38:18,508 --> 00:38:24,925
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

461
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:30,550
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

462
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:33,508
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

463
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:36,758
which is done in every country, in every religion

464
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:40,800
but now we should take a vow to save others

465
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:45,633
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

466
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:51,050
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

467
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:55,217
through your lives Christ's work has been done.

468
00:38:55,217 --> 00:39:02,633
You have to now express Christ through your life, this is what it is.

469
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:08,217
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

470
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:12,092
through the meekness, through the compassion

471
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:20,800
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

472
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,717
and that's why you have to be fearless

473
00:39:23,717 --> 00:39:29,466
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

474
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:33,175
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong

475
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:36,800
then there's nothing to be afraid of God also because he loves you very much.

476
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:46,800
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

477
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:53,967
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

478
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:59,092
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

479
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:00,883
because of the virtues you have.

480
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:05,259
May God Bless you all.
