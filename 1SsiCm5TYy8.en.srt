Dedication through Meditation
Cowley Manor Seminar

2
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:52,590
Cheltenham, England
31st July 1982

3
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:29,340
Today, for the 

4
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:59,659
first time, I’m venturing to say something
which I should have said much earlier.

5
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:16,440
As today I told you that it is necessary that
you have to recognize Me.

6
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,850
And that recognition is fixed, that condition
is fixed.

7
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,100
I cannot change it.

8
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:43,270
As Christ has already said, that “Anything
against Me will be tolerated, will be forgiven,

9
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,060
but anything against the Holy Ghost will not
be.’’

10
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,310
It’s a very big warning ... very big warning.

11
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,760
Perhaps people don’t realize what it means.

12
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,300
Of course none of you are against Me, that
I know, and you don’t do anything against

13
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,319
Me, that’s very true.

14
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:22,050
After all, you are My children, I love you
very much and you love Me.

15
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:30,030
That’s only the warning that Christ has
given you.

16
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:44,520
But one must think why we are not progressing
so fast as we should have.

17
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:54,989
When people are mesmerized, they fall completely
flat on the ground in front of their gurus,

18
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:55,989
absolutely.

19
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:04,450
They give up their money, they give up everything,
homes, houses, families, children, and just

20
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:15,660
go flat - when they are mesmerized; without
asking any questions, without going into any

21
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:24,449
detail, without trying to find out the life
of their guru.

22
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:41,889
All such people also go very fast into darkness,
into greater darkness, and into complete destruction.

23
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:49,250
But you are Sahaja Yogis and you have to construct
yourself.

24
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,020
I didn’t want to shatter your egos before,
never to tell you in these words.

25
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,690
Perhaps this is the first time I am saying
this to you, that you have to dedicate yourself

26
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,659
completely to Me - not to Sahaja Yoga - but
to Me.

27
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:12,219
Sahaja Yoga is just one of My aspects.

28
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:18,400
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

29
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot
ascend any further.

30
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,680
Without questioning, without arguing.

31
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,150
Complete dedication is the only way you can
achieve it.

32
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,289
People still get caught up, still get into
problems.

33
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,770
What’s the reason?

34
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:53,699
So many people ask Me that, “Once we have
got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?”

35
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:00,930
The only reason is the dedication is not complete.

36
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,889
Is complete reverence and complete dedication
has been not established.

37
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:15,990
You still do not know that I am Divine, to
that extent as you should.

38
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,520
I don’t say all of you.

39
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:26,110
But still if you look into your heart and
look into your mind, you’ll find out that

40
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:35,110
complete devotion that you had for say, Christ,
or for Krishna, or for any one of those who

41
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,509
have been, is not there.

42
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,889
Krishna said, Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam
sharanam vraja.

43
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,479
“Forget all the religions of the world.”

44
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,569
He didn’t mean the religions like Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, but He was meaning all

45
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,699
the sustenances.

46
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:03,759
“Forget all the sustenances, and completely
dedicate to Me.”

47
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,779
That was six thousand years back.

48
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:12,469
And there are many who would still say that
“we have completely dedicated ourselves

49
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:14,849
to Shri Krishna.”

50
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,590
Where is He now?

51
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:24,020
Even those whom I have given Realization,
they say like this.

52
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,759
Of course, there’s no difference between
Him and Me, but today I am the one, I am the

53
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,009
one who has given you Realization.

54
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:53,319
But our first consideration could be our jobs,
our own problems, our family problems, our

55
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:03,509
financial problems, and dedication is the
last.

56
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,559
I’m illusive, is true.

57
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:09,559
My name is Mahamaya.

58
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,800
I am illusive, no doubt.

59
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:25,809
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

60
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:34,209
Now the dedication is a very important part
of the ascent.

61
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,500
Why?

62
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:47,700
Because when you are precariously placed,
when there is immediate danger to your existence;

63
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:59,640
at this time, when the whole world is standing
at a precarious position where it is going

64
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:09,033
to be destroyed completely, it’s very important
that you cling on to thing that is going to

65
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:18,530
save you with complete might and complete
faith.

66
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,730
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary
water, doesn’t matter.

67
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,370
But if you are sinking in the sea, and there’s
a question of this moment of existence and

68
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:38,720
that moment of destruction - that time, if
a hand comes forward to fetch you out, there’s

69
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:54,620
no time for you to think anymore but cling
on to it, with all your might, with all your

70
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,710
faith.

71
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:04,740
When we have baddhas, when we are surrounded
by negativity, we get aware of it, and little

72
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,390
bit we get confused.

73
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,840
And that’s the time we want to cling on.

74
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,780
But the baddhas give you ideas which are detrimental.

75
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:25,810
So big struggle is set in.

76
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:34,660
At that time, what is the best way?

77
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,710
Best way is to forget everything else.

78
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,850
Forget that you are possessed, or there’s
baddha or anything.

79
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:55,650
With all your might, whatever is there, you
have to hold on to Me.

80
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:07,760
But our style of dedication is very fashionable
and modern, in which Sahaja Yoga is by the

81
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,280
way, and Mother is very much by the way.

82
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,870
I’m sorry it’s not going to work out.

83
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,990
I don’t have to tell this to Indians, because
if you read Devi Mahatmayam it’s sufficient.

84
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:30,420
Even if you read Her thousand names, it’s
sufficient, that She can be only achieved

85
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,420
through bhakti.

86
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,680
She can only be achieved through dedication.

87
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,860
She’s only fond of Her bhaktas, the devotees.

88
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,490
It’s nowhere written that She is fond of
people who can talk better, who can argue

89
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,880
better, who dress better, who live better,
who have better surroundings - but Her devotees.

90
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:02,880
And this devotion and dedication should not
be a frenzy or anything, but should be sustained,

91
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,220
continuous, ever-flowing, ever growing.

92
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:15,530
That’s the only way, now, for further development.

93
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:29,900
For us, so many small problems are important.

94
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,720
Somebody has a house, somebody has a admission
in the college, somebody has some job to be

95
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:43,240
done.

96
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:51,870
All these considerations are the dharmas which
Shri Krishna has described as Sarva dharmanam

97
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,110
parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja.

98
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,780
Give up all the dharmas - all these so called
dharmas.

99
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:05,920
Like a patni dharma is the duty of a wife,
then the pati dharma is duty of a husband,

100
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,630
then the putra dharma is the duty of a son,
the pita dharma duty of a father, and duty

101
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,470
of a citizen, and a duty of a world-citizen.

102
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:34,620
All these dharmas are to be given up, entirely,
and you have to surrender fully from your

103
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,250
heart.

104
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,340
I am what I am, I’ve been that, I’ll be
that.

105
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,110
I’m not going to grow any more, or less.

106
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,710
This is an eternal Personality.

107
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:03,380
It is now for you to get out of Me whatever
is possible, to make the best use of your

108
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:27,340
birth in these modern times, to grow to your
full maturity, to be able to work out the

109
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:39,500
complete design that Divine wants to do through
you.

110
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:51,470
As soon as the dedication starts, you become
dynamic.

111
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,800
Clinging on to that.

112
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:04,990
For this, meditation is the only way, I should
say.

113
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,300
Of course, rationally you can do many things.

114
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,940
You can rationally accept Me.

115
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,740
Emotionally you may feel closer to Me in your
heart.

116
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,960
But through meditation, surrender.

117
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:40,550
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is
complete surrendering - which is a difficult

118
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,540
task for a modern man in the Western countries.

119
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:51,980
He only surrenders to people who mesmerize,
who fully mesmerize them.

120
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,680
They become slaves of people who mesmerize.

121
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:06,360
But in their own freedom, their ego is more
powerful than their Spirit - in their own

122
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
freedom.

123
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,750
That’s why all the free countries have gone
to dogs.

124
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,050
Because ego plays part, not the Spirit.

125
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:27,610
They cannot master their ego when they are
free.

126
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,310
Only if somebody can just entangle their ego
and mesmerize them, then they are all right

127
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,540
- they are shut, completely they surrender.

128
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:45,720
And it’s so obvious from the way these false
people have mastered their art of making slaves

129
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,050
out of you.

130
00:16:49,050 --> 00:17:09,429
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you
have to surrender.

131
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:15,309
Freedom does not mean ego, one should understand.

132
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:21,669
Freedom is killed by ego.

133
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:29,549
Not only killed but is disfigured and disgraced,
is made ugly.

134
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:48,919
Freedom, in its subtlest form, means complete
egolessness, no angularities, complete hollowness,

135
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,049
just like the flute, so that the melody of
God could be played well.

136
00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:04,049
That’s complete freedom - no “hangs-up”.

137
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:22,730
We have to realize that we are in the mire:
mire of ignorance, mire of sin.

138
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,380
Ignorance brings sin.

139
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:37,090
How are we to get out of the mire?

140
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,590
Anybody who tries to pull us out will also
go in the mire.

141
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:51,090
Anybody who wants to come even near the mire,
gets into the mire.

142
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,399
He becomes part and parcel of the mire.

143
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:04,210
The more we try to take help from others,
we pull him more in the mire and we go more

144
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,919
down, deep down, into it.

145
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:27,369
So the tree of Kundalini has to grow, and
from that tree, Paramatma Himself, the Parabrahma

146
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:35,260
itself has to pull you out.

147
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:48,000
It grows out of the mire, and the Parabrahma
has to pull you out, one by one, take you

148
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,419
in the hand and swing you outward.

149
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:10,999
But still when you are pulled out, your catch
is not sufficient, you slip down again.

150
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:21,330
You come up partly, again you go down.

151
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,720
It’s very enjoyable to be out of it, but
still the feet have not come out fully.

152
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,129
Still you are not completely cleansed.

153
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:40,940
Unless and until you are cleansed how can
you be completely blessed?

154
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:52,080
You have to be fully blessed by the Divine,
clothed by the love of God.

155
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:00,850
It is surprising to see how the people who
go to these false gurus stick on to him, or

156
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:10,250
stick on to her, in such tremendous dedication,
that you are amazed - they become just like

157
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,250
cabbages.

158
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:24,509
Till they are completely ruined they just
go on surrendering everything that they have.

159
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:37,340
But in Sahaja Yoga, when people come, they
do not surrender, but they are nourished,

160
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,000
they are looked after.

161
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,980
Their health improves, their wealth improves,
their mind improves, their relations improve,

162
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,059
every way they feel better, their conditions
improve.

163
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:57,830
They are all the time getting the benefit.

164
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:12,610
We have ashrams which are beautiful, which
are the cheapest, and the food, every advantage

165
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:20,299
that is available -best possible.

166
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:38,039
Everything is there.

167
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:49,980
But we don’t realize that all this nourishment
is for what?

168
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,190
All these blessings are for what?

169
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,499
For your higher ascent.

170
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:01,179
For getting out of the mire completely.

171
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:12,249
Now, you have to adhere, you have to be dedicated,
you have to be devoted.

172
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:26,159
We have reservations, we hide things.

173
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:39,139
We try to be smart.

174
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:52,109
That’s a dangerous situation.

175
00:23:52,109 --> 00:24:14,129
You all should, within yourself, try to see
what part is so sneaky.

176
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:22,070
What conditioning is keeping you out of dedication?

177
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:28,090
What is making you have reservations?

178
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:41,570
What fright, which ego, what angle still sticking
out into the mire?

179
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:52,159
What attachments, what relationships?

180
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:01,470
You have to get out of it.

181
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:09,350
Unless and until you fully get out of it,
it’s not going to work out.

182
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:18,289
There’s no place for half-way things.

183
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:23,440
It’s question of now or never.

184
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,480
Christ has said it.

185
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:42,029
He has said it, “You give your devotion
and dedication and leave the rest to Me.’’

186
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:51,759
I know who are progressing in dedication and
devotion.

187
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,769
I have seen people improving so much.

188
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:02,489
You need not face Me, you need not see Me.

189
00:26:02,489 --> 00:26:05,020
In person I need not be there.

190
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,419
It’s all in the all-pervading Power.

191
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:21,620
That’s all My light, which knows each and
everything about you.

192
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,769
And only through your bhakti, through your
devotion and dedication, you can achieve Me.

193
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:39,470
My achievement is the complete manifestation
of your Divine power.

194
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:48,770
It’s very simple, made so simple.

195
00:26:48,770 --> 00:27:02,789
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,
innocent, who are not tricky, who are loving,

196
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,580
affectionate to each other.

197
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,879
It’s very easy to please Me.

198
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:21,520
When I see you loving each other, talking
good of each other, helping each other, respecting

199
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:31,609
each other, laughing aloud together, enjoying
together each other’s company, I get My

200
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:43,539
first blessing, first joy.

201
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:53,150
Try to love each other, in dedication to Me,
because you are all My children, created out

202
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,669
of My love.

203
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:04,690
In the womb of My love you all have resided.

204
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:13,350
From My heart I have given you these blessings.

205
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:23,080
I get disturbed, My hands shake and you fall
back into the mire again, when I see you quarrelling

206
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,239
among yourselves.

207
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:33,220
Jealousies and petty things which belong to
your past life.

208
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:58,109
The help is not so much gross that is felt,
but is a very deeper sense of security, that

209
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:05,739
is given to your brothers and sisters.

210
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:11,070
A deep love should exist.

211
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:21,630
Selfishness has no place in Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,470
Miserliness has no place - has no place.

213
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,710
Miserliness is a sign of a very small mind.

214
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,019
I’m not saying you give Me money, of course.

215
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:42,840
But the way we look at money, the way we cling
on to it, the material things, the material

216
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,629
wealth, the material objects, the possessions
you see.

217
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:50,389
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

218
00:29:50,389 --> 00:30:02,200
Through Her you have your brothers and sisters.

219
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,159
Get out of that past life.

220
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,289
That past is the mire.

221
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:20,580
That should be over now.

222
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:28,960
You are quite aware how, with My power of
Love, I have protected you all.

223
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,049
You know how, at every moment, I’ve helped
you.

224
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:42,619
At every point of your desire, I have come
forward to fulfill it.

225
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:54,909
That’s one side, as I said, the nourishment.

226
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:58,850
But now your ascent has to come from you.

227
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:10,669
Your rising has to come from you.

228
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:16,340
That has to be worked out by you and you alone.

229
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:23,249
Not by any other Sahaja Yogi or by Me.

230
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:28,299
I can only give you suggestions.

231
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:32,840
Not only the suggestion, but the warnings.

232
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,039
And everything is at hand.

233
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,039
It’s all worked out so well.

234
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,389
I’m in Form.

235
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:42,080
I’m in Form before you.

236
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,299
You don’t have to go anywhere.

237
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:51,159
The whole thing is within yourself.

238
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:56,960
You don’t have to give money, you don’t
have to give anything.

239
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,000
But develop that dedication within yourself.

240
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:19,570
You see, this man who interviewed Me said
that the unemployed are maneuvered by the

241
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,549
politicians.

242
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:29,509
Let God maneuver you.

243
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:33,350
But how?

244
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:39,529
Supposing I have a brush in My hand, I want
to paint something, and the brush I cannot

245
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:42,249
maneuver.

246
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:52,789
The brush is angular, it’s troublesome,
it’s inconvenient to use that, or, you can

247
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:58,970
say it’s uncomfortable, it’s awkward,
it’s clumsy.

248
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:06,549
How can you use it?

249
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:13,109
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of
all your angularities, all your problems,

250
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:20,049
all your baddhas.

251
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:29,940
Now watch and see within yourself: are you
dedicated?

252
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:38,119
Those who are fanatically adhering to Me are
also not correct.

253
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,499
There should be no fanaticism about it.

254
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:49,179
The whole thing becomes a complete logical
thing.

255
00:33:49,179 --> 00:34:03,580
There is no fanaticism about it.

256
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:20,700
Like, somebody 
has to go to a doctor, to see a doctor, then

257
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:27,830
fanatic person might say, “Oh, I’m not
going to see the doctor.

258
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:35,419
I’m not going, because Mother has told me
that She’s going to look after me.”

259
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:42,260
And when she gets sick, she’ll come to Mother
in fright, “Mother You had told me that

260
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,909
You’ll look after me, and how is it I’ve
got sick?”

261
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,900
This is fanaticism.

262
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,440
What is surrendering?

263
00:34:51,440 --> 00:35:02,570
Deep down you should say, “It’s the Mother,
She’s there, She’s my doctor.

264
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:09,930
Whether She treats me or not, whether She
cures me or not I’ve nothing to say.

265
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,930
I only know Her.

266
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:18,910
I don’t know anyone else.”

267
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,850
Is very logical.

268
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,900
The logic is, that Mother is the most powerful
thing that you know - logically it’s true.

269
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,570
“And if She is so, She’ll cure me.

270
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,630
But if She does not cure me, it’s Her Power,
it’s Her whim.

271
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,870
If She wants to cure me, She’ll cure me.

272
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,680
If She does not want to cure me, how can I
put my will upon Her?”

273
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,520
Like the dedication of Shri Ganesha.

274
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,490
That when his Mother said, “All right, between
the two brothers, Kartikeya and Him, the one

275
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:05,520
who will go round the Mother Earth first will
get the first prize.’’

276
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:14,850
Now poor Ganesha had a little rat on which
to move, but wisdom He had.

277
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:22,380
And Kartikeya had a very quick-moving peacock
which used to fly.

278
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:32,000
He looked at the peacock and He said, “Who
is greater than My Mother?

279
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
She’s Adi Shakti.

280
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,260
What is this earth?

281
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,010
Who has created this earth?

282
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,660
Is My Mother has created her.

283
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,510
Who has created this sun?

284
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,870
The Mother has created it.

285
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,520
Who is greater than My Mother?

286
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,020
No one else.

287
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,060
Why not go round My Mother only?

288
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,630
What’s the need to go all round the whole
earth?”

289
00:36:52,630 --> 00:37:01,880
And much before Kartikeya arrived He was sitting
with His present in His hand.

290
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:08,560
His innocence gave Him this wisdom to understand
– that’s what logical is.

291
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,089
It’s very logical.

292
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:17,560
And also logical it is that “Mother feels
my pain more than I feel.”

293
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:25,010
What will you say when Christ was crucified
for his Mother?

294
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:31,480
She was Mahalakshmi Herself, so powerful.

295
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,580
She made Her Son sacrifice His life, suffer
like a human being.

296
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:49,860
It was too much, to make Your Son sacrifice,
when You have all the powers in Your hand

297
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,180
to finish everyone there.

298
00:37:51,180 --> 00:38:03,300
But was a very delicate job to create this
Agnya Chakra.

299
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,270
What does that mean?

300
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:18,510
Does that mean that He lacked something in
His devotion?

301
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:30,850
On the contrary, She was so sure of Him, of
His devotion, that She could ask Him to do

302
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,000
that.

303
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,480
So when we expect Mother to do something for
you, there are people who say, “All right,

304
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,070
Mother I’m giving this thesis.

305
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,380
I must get through.”

306
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,240
All right, give a bandhan, you get a thesis.

307
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,900
“Mother, I’m trying to discover this.’’

308
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,270
All right, you have it.

309
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,550
“Mother I’m trying to get this job.’’

310
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,310
You have it.

311
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:59,670
Now, is the other way round.

312
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,390
How many have dedication that of Christ?

313
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,410
None.

314
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,450
It’s a fact.

315
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:11,100
Why is He the eldest brother?

316
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,330
Because no-one like Him.

317
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:26,040
He went through all those horrible sufferings,
because He was part and parcel of His Mother.

318
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,100
She suffered much more than Him.

319
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:35,930
He also went through that suffering for a
greater goal, for a greater happiness, for

320
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,950
a greater life, for a wholesome life.

321
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:45,940
That is real dedication.

322
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:53,140
But the false people can take advantage of
this.

323
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,800
When they make the people suffer, they say,
“after all, you have to suffer.”

324
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,530
See how they make it up.

325
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:09,270
“You must suffer because after all you must
suffer, otherwise you cannot rise.”

326
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:19,230
It’s a very subtle understanding, very subtle
it is.

327
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:25,750
That will make it clear to you that in Sahaja
Yoga first you are nourished, you are brought

328
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,080
up, you are trained, you are made all right.

329
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:37,330
And all the things after that, the sufferings,
are no more sufferings to you because you

330
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,950
have become the Spirit.

331
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:45,960
“Nainam chhidanti shashtrani, nainam dahti
pavkah, nainam kledanti aapoh, nainam shoshati

332
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:56,540
marutah”: “It cannot be killed by any
instrument, it cannot be thrown away or blown

333
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,430
away by any wind, it cannot be burnt by any
fire.”

334
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:09,490
There’s no way you can destroy this.

335
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:15,920
That is the Spirit that you are.

336
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,030
So the nourishment has been given now.

337
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,900
You have grown up.

338
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,330
You are nourished.

339
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,740
People when they see Sahaja Yogis, say, “Oh,
they are like flowers.

340
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,080
See their faces, they glow.

341
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,890
How confident, how dignified, how beautiful.”

342
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:39,420
But for what?

343
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,890
To be the wheels of the chariot of God.

344
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:58,230
You have to bear the brunt, and the sacrifices,
which are no more sacrifices to you because

345
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,160
Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

346
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,750
Its quality is to give.

347
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,640
So you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

348
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:20,180
First the mother has the labor pains, all
right, she has all the problems, all right.

349
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:32,060
When the child is grown then he stands by
the mother.

350
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,860
He is the proud son.

351
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,430
She is proud of him and he is proud of her.

352
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:47,300
They stand together, they fight the battle
together.

353
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:59,150
That’s only possible if complete dedication
and preparation for the future life of a Sahaja

354
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,980
Yogi, you accept.

355
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:14,640
A life which outwardly looks to be a struggle,
a problem, but inwardly is most fulfilling.

356
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:24,710
Once upon a time, when Sahaja Yogis come to
Me, to them even to sit on the ground is too

357
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:30,670
much of a sacrifice; even to take out shoes
is a big sacrifice.

358
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,750
Yesterday, in a program, three people walked
off because they were asked to take out shoes,

359
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,660
as if somebody was making them bald-headed.

360
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:48,830
They just walked off.

361
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:54,110
But why to grow in Sahaja Yoga?

362
00:43:54,110 --> 00:44:01,800
To grow, to stand up like great children of
a great Mother.

363
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,650
The work is tremendous.

364
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:19,190
It’s not for medium, mediocre people to
do this job, frightened, fearful, arrogant,

365
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:35,020
cheeky - they cannot, they have no mettle.

366
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:50,270
So, the dedication in meditation, complete
dedication in meditation must be practiced.

367
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:57,180
It’s not for your good now you are doing,
so-called “your”.

368
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:02,860
First you were a little baby, a small thing;
now you are that collective being, so you

369
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:07,200
are not doing anything for yourself, but for
that collective being.

370
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:23,860
You are growing to be aware of that whole
which you are going to become.

371
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:36,630
Your jobs, your money, your wives, your husbands,
your children, your father, mother, relations,

372
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:43,460
these considerations are over now.

373
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,400
You all have to take up the responsibility
of Sahaja Yoga.

374
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,290
Every one of you is quite capable.

375
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:04,000
You are brought up for that.

376
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:13,660
Do whichever way you like, whatever are your
capacities.

377
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:21,760
With full dedication you’ll get it.

378
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:31,330
Dedication is the thing.

379
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:38,460
Complete dedication is the only way you can
go further.

380
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,650
There are some Sahaja Yogis, who are half-baked,
we have to drop them.

381
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,000
We can’t help it.

382
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,390
You don’t have sympathies with them.

383
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,390
No good.

384
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,890
If they prove all right we’ll bring them
back again, but you leave that to Me.

385
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,160
You don’t put your effort or put your attention
to them.

386
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,140
You have to come up.

387
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:12,680
You were seekers, then you have found it,
now you have thrived over it, now you are

388
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,220
grown up.

389
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,760
For what?

390
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,620
Is to stand up.

391
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:27,110
As I am facing you today, you have to face
the others, you have to face the people.

392
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,730
Dedication doesn’t mean that you don’t
talk of Sahaja Yoga.

393
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,660
Many people think that keeping silent is the
way you are dedicated.

394
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,170
Only in meditation you should be.

395
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:45,140
But you have to get out of that shell.

396
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:54,730
Tell all the nations and tell all the people,
all over, the great message that the time

397
00:47:54,730 --> 00:48:04,170
of Resurrection is here, now, at this time,
and that you all are capable of doing it.

398
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:17,770
If somebody tries to sneer at you for that,
with understanding, wisdom, try to say things.

399
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:25,180
Individual likes and dislikes must be sacrificed.

400
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,830
“I like this” and “I like that” must
be given up.

401
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:36,480
It doesn’t mean that you all become like
machines.

402
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,850
No.

403
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:43,530
But the enslavement to this “I” must be
given up.

404
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,000
Enslavery to habits must be given up.

405
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,280
You’ll be amazed.

406
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,570
Once you are dedicated, you’ll not eat much.

407
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,030
You may not eat at all sometimes.

408
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,160
You wouldn’t even remember a food.

409
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,790
You wouldn’t even remember what you have
eaten.

410
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:13,970
You wouldn’t even remember where you slept,
how you slept.

411
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:26,110
Is a life that will be like a telescope - expanding.

412
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:34,620
You will create your own visions and complete
them, fulfill them.

413
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:44,140
You look so simple, ordinary people, but you
are not.

414
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:59,210
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have
to do it, now, not for your own gain, for

415
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,650
your own achievement, that’s over now.

416
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:15,210
Is for completely getting out of the mire
and standing on the land, singing aloud the

417
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:20,410
praise of your Father.

418
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,970
Those who are in the mire, what music can
they give?

419
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,230
What songs they can sing?

420
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:31,270
What security can they give?

421
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:35,400
What help they can render to others?

422
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,380
You have to be out of it, completely.

423
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:47,810
Steadfast wisdom is needed for that, steadfast.

424
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:53,600
Every moment.

425
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:06,200
You need not blame your left side and right
side for that, nothing, you just get out of

426
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,200
it.

427
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Cling on to it.

428
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,930
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

429
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,210
Cling on to it.

430
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,370
Even the death has to go back.

431
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:22,270
Then what about these minor things?

432
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:40,680
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

433
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:53,840
You know that is the most powerful Name than
all other names, the most powerful mantra.

434
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,470
But you must know how to take it.

435
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:03,870
With that complete dedication you have to
take that Name.

436
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,200
Not like any other name.

437
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,460
You know that in India when take the name
of Guru, they pull their ears for taking the

438
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,800
name of the Guru.

439
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:22,160
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making
any mistakes, please forgive me” - means

440
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,980
that.

441
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:30,040
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

442
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:43,100
Only what you need is the dedication, the
dynamite of dedication.

443
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:54,230
Today I told Rita that all the daisies in
England have fragrance now.

444
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,270
She couldn’t believe it.

445
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,770
She said, “I have never known that.

446
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:04,460
On the contrary I always felt that daisies
had no fragrance and they were very funnily-smelling

447
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,510
flowers.’’

448
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:12,160
I said, “All right, these daisies you have,
just go and smell them.’’

449
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,310
When she smelt it, she was surprised.

450
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,770
The Name, how subtle it is.

451
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:26,490
They are the most fragrant flowers of England
today.

452
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:45,580
Just the Name; which means Nishkalanka, which
means Nirmala, which means completely without

453
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,580
any mala.

454
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,710
What is this, mala?

455
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,870
Is this mire.

456
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:55,340
Without any mire.

457
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,830
Nil.

458
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,330
Absolutely.

459
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:03,520
The joy at the Sahasrara is called as Nirananda,
since long.

460
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,480
Since ancient times called Nirananda or Nirmalananda.

461
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:15,400
So many call it as Nirmalananda or Nirananda.

462
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:22,700
That joy is the joy that you enjoy even when
you get crucified.

463
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,650
That joy, you enjoy even when you are poisoned.

464
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,450
Even on your deathbed, you enjoy that joy.

465
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,830
That joy is Nirananda.

466
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:43,540
So be prepared for the second phase.

467
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,220
You are in the front.

468
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:54,030
It’s very little time I need.

469
00:54:54,030 --> 00:55:02,070
But I need really people with steadfast wisdom
and dedication; steadfast.

470
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:13,780
Even for a second it should not go this side
or that side.

471
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:23,460
Then, we can progress faster, we can go ahead
to fight the battle.

472
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:32,430
Perhaps now you are aware of the subtleties
of the negativities, how they work, how they

473
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:42,350
use their power - of course which is limited
- to destroy God’s work, and how you have

474
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:47,070
to be alert, equipped, and dedicated.

475
00:55:47,070 --> 00:56:03,610
This I can only talk to you, I cannot say
to the people who come to Caxton Hall.

476
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:14,490
Some of them are half-baked, some of them
are absolutely new, naive, and some of them

477
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,200
are absolutely third-raters.

478
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:31,510
But here, as you are before Me today, I want
to tell you very frankly, as Krishna had told

479
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:40,270
only Arjuna, “sarva dharmanam parityajya,
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

480
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:45,750
There’s no other way out.

481
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:58,120
Vraja means the one who is twice-born, like
a solid, solid personality.

482
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,840
When you are solid then you must dedicate.

483
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,730
When you are perfected then you must dedicate.

484
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:21,150
It will help you to get out of the mire, and
then it will help the great cause.

485
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:28,110
No one understands that why Mother is trying
to help us?

486
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:32,030
Oh they think She’s too generous.

487
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:33,110
I’m not.

488
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:40,150
I’ve lot of common sense.

489
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:55,330
Because you are the ones who are capable of
manifesting God’s joy on this earth.

490
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,230
You are the flutes which are going to play
the melody of God.

491
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:09,560
You are going to be used and maneuvered by
God.

492
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:18,270
I am doing all this to perfect you, to be
the most beautiful instrument of God.

493
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:21,880
To be the right instrument of God.

494
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:37,630
I don’t know if you understand how sweet,
beautiful life it would be.

495
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:52,110
The life of dedication, with understanding,
logical, completely dedicated, extracting

496
00:58:52,110 --> 00:59:03,360
all the nourishment, and dedicating it for
a higher purpose.

497
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:20,350
Something like the leaves extract the sun’s
rays, and give color, achieve color for themselves,

498
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:31,440
for a higher purpose, that they can be used
by human beings later on.

499
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,420
Nothing on this earth works out the other
way round.

500
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:56,740
Everything works out for a purpose; but such
an unselfish, such a wide, such a great, dynamic

501
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,430
purpose.

502
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:13,840
You become the ocean, you become the moon,
you become the sun, you become the earth,

503
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:21,070
you become the ether, the firmament, and you
become the Spirit.

504
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:26,530
You work for all of them.

505
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:35,150
All the stars and universes you become, and
take up their work.

506
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:42,710
That’s what it is.

507
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,420
Because you have jumped onto your principle,
onto your tattwa.

508
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,390
That’s how you jump onto everybody’s tattwa.

509
01:00:52,390 --> 01:01:02,410
But be dedicated on that tattwa, because I
am the Principle of all these things.

510
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:09,140
I am the tattwa - Tattvamasi, I am the Principle.

511
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:17,580
Keep to your principle.

512
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:21,790
I am the Kundalini.

513
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:27,460
I am the Essence.

514
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:35,080
We can only understand dedication of something
which looks bigger in gross ways, which appears

515
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,420
bigger in a gross way.

516
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:45,210
But we cannot dedicate ourselves to something
that is so much subtler, which is so much

517
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:57,910
minuter, which is so much deeper, which is
so much effective, which is so much dynamic,

518
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,000
so universal and so eternal.

519
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:10,760
We cannot think of dedicating ourselves to
that.

520
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,700
We can surrender ourselves to somebody who
looks like a mountain, who comes to oppress

521
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:21,980
us just like a mountain, who is like Hitler,
who is like a false guru.

522
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:39,790
But to surrender to your subtler being, which
you cannot see with your eyes, which is not

523
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:50,730
audible, but, in effect, is so powerful.

524
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:55,090
Like the atomic bomb, when the atom is split.

525
01:02:55,090 --> 01:03:02,700
When it is not split, it’s everywhere.

526
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:15,140
But at the subtlest point it’s so dynamic
that, when you separate it, it becomes such

527
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:18,240
a dynamic force of destruction.

528
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:34,410
As your attention has now penetrated into
the subtler side of this universe, you get

529
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:40,369
deeper and deeper into.

530
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:57,310
The urge that takes the end of the root to
the source of water, is the same as the source.

531
01:03:57,310 --> 01:04:09,600
Your Kundalini is the same as the Adi Kundalini
and its Power, the Parabrahma.

532
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:23,240
All these things are to be understood after
Realization and after maturity.

533
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,190
Before that it’s not possible.

534
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:30,770
That’s why for last eight years, I didn’t
say these things to you.

535
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:41,690
I was always on a very patronizing and a sweet
terms with you.

536
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:47,810
And always, I made you feel that you are obliging
Me.

537
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:56,920
There’s no obligation.

538
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:05,790
But beyond all these conceptions, you have
become your Self.

539
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:12,250
Now ready to be responsible, to be what you
are made for.

540
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:25,030
Like the ship is built, is brought to the
sea, tried, and found out to be sea-worthy,

541
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:33,640
to sail out now, into the sea.

542
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:42,240
So this is the second phase, where you have
to sail out, when you know everything about

543
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,450
the ship, everything about the sea.

544
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:57,970
With complete freedom and wisdom, you have
to sail now, not afraid of any storms, or

545
01:05:57,970 --> 01:06:07,180
any hails, or any typhoons, because now on
you know, your job is to cross through.

546
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,910
May God bless you!

547
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:10,640
May God bless you!

548
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,240
Should we meditate for a while?

549
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:30,810
Can you put off the lights?

550
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:52,240
Such vibrations, I tell you.

551
01:06:52,240 --> 01:07:16,230
If you can form a chain, would be a good idea...

552
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:20,110
[SOUNDS OF YOGIS SHIFTING]
 

553
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:24,430
Just see where is Aradhana and Anupama and
also, who's there, Bhavila just look after

554
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:25,430
them.

555
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,430
And where is that.

556
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:29,170
Kay, can you go down and also see where is
that lady?

557
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:32,040
This is a big house and they should not be
lost."
