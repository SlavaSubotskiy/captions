1
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,671
It's a great day

2
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,751
for Me to come to Italy

3
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,971
to celebrate

4
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,191
Ganesh Puja

5
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:57,441
The nature

6
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,223
which we see around

7
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,971
is the blessing of the Ganesha only

8
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:05,563
because He is the one who prays to the Mother Earth

9
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,991
that

10
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,951
she should grant her blessings upon

11
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:10,951
human beings

12
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,621
It is He

13
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:31,871
who moulds

14
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,581
all the elements of the nature

15
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,811
and moulds them to create life.

16
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:55,111
As you call them, these are all carbohydrates.

17
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:04,661
Now the carbohydrates have got carbon and hydrogen.

18
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:12,601
Carbon is coming

19
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:14,801
from Shri Ganesh

20
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,631
and hydrogen is coming from Mahakali.

21
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,641
And that is how this universe is created

22
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:31,181
in this beautiful way all around us.

23
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:39,881
Now,

24
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:45,501
these carbohydrates need oxygen which is given to us by the Sun,

25
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,971
by the right side.

26
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:01,001
Thus, you know that in the night

27
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,371
these trees emit hydrogen

28
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:09,146
and in the day time they generate oxygen.

29
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:24,146
This is all the trick of Shri Ganesha who is sitting in between

30
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,521
Now it is He who becomes the Sun.

31
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,341
He ascents from the

32
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,231
deep down seat

33
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,601
below the Kundalini,

34
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,641
rises on the left hand side of Mahakali,

35
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:51,681
goes up and settles in the Surya,

36
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,201
that is the Agnya.

37
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,511
So, Mahakali which is the Primordial Energy

38
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,231
is absolutely transcended by Him.

39
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:29,561
As the child of Mahakali

40
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,061
He is absolutely dedicated and devoted to Her.

41
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:44,561
And that is how He is the master of the Mahakali power,Lord of.

42
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,221
That means He is the Lord of subconscious mind.

43
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:00,041
He is the Lord of all the 'jadas'.

44
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,241
Jada,

45
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,471
that is, you can say the dead.

46
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,411
Not the dead but 'jada' is the one

47
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,841
matter which has not - matter and the dead.

48
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,231
You must understand the word 'jada'.

49
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:23,546
Very important. Jada means all that is the matter which is not moving,

50
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,946
without life.

51
00:07:34,806 --> 00:07:37,186
So He can transcend

52
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,801
this

53
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,661
great power

54
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,481
and become the lord of that power

55
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,831
by one

56
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,566
very small little wisdom He has.

57
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,246
Now that small little wisdom is

58
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:12,731
surrender.

59
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:24,071
And the surrender is to be understood in it's proper sense.

60
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,191
Surrender

61
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,971
is signifying,

62
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,846
no giving up anything.

63
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:48,486
Because whenever you try to give up or take up you are using your ego.

64
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,526
But surrendering means

65
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,271
giving up the ego itself.

66
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:12,711
So, all the ideas of giving up something

67
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,411
or taking in something, disappear.

68
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,381
Keep your eyes open because you see I'm talking about

69
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,141
the subconscious  and I don't want you to keep your eyes close, that's a sign

70
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:32,926
of going into subconscious.

71
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,386
This has to be recorded in your conscious mind.

72
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,891
Now when we surrender,

73
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,371
we have to see how Ritambara Pragnya,

74
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,711
which is the power

75
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,701
of Mahalakshmi, the essence of Mahalakshmi,

76
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:05,951
how She helps you.

77
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,931
Like situations we should accept

78
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,741
Say, this morning, it was Amavasya,

79
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,751
it's the day when if you worship

80
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:39,791
Shri Ganesha, it's very deep.So, I wanted to have

81
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:44,201
from the end of Amavasya to start the puja.

82
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,511
Now, that's why the water finished;

83
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:02,721
it would not start

84
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,706
I could not take my bath.

85
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:19,346
Because I have said- if I had said that we'll have puja at lunch time, many would have felt, "Oh God, now no lunch".

86
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,971
But that was the right time to start the puja,

87
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,171
so there was no water

88
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,966
and I had to wait for the water.

89
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,626
And a simple thing like that happened

90
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,586
but it achieved

91
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,731
the right time.

92
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:11,581
Now when you start

93
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,661
accepting situations,

94
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:18,261
then you realize that all the situations

95
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,571
are created

96
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:24,911
not by anything else but Ritambara Pragnya Herself.

97
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:46,201
But ego is such a thing, that it wants to do the way it likes.

98
00:12:58,171 --> 00:13:03,901
So people start doing things against the plans of the Divine.

99
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,591
And all the time they are in friction

100
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,226
and in trouble, going against.

101
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:28,006
And thus, they have to take a double speed to fight.

102
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:37,991
But going against the Divine, we are going against our ascent.

103
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:47,611
These egos develop as a result

104
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:50,731
of our upbringing, atmosphere

105
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:54,191
and as a natural idea to assert.

106
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,401
These as our conditioning and our upbringing

107
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:05,321
and also as a natural idea we have to assert others.

108
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,266
Natural idea

109
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,146
No assertion, assertion means pressing others,

110
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,031
dominating others.

111
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:49,461
Now this domination part come to us

112
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:53,021
from the matter because the matter dominates the Spirit.

113
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:06,121
It dominates us through giving us comfort,

114
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,741
false notions, false ideas.

115
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:19,711
It dominates through our desires

116
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,651
It dominates through lust and greed.

117
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:36,151
Also it dominates us

118
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,421
through a very

119
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,171
subtle way

120
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,601
by possessing us through bhoots as we call them.

121
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,291
And this is what

122
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,691
we see how

123
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,941
Shri Ganesha ascended

124
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:08,271
as Christ to show us how we have to ascend

125
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:11,561
out of all this mire of matter.

126
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:33,761
As He is ascending we catch hold of this feet and we also ascend with Him.

127
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:45,151
Though He is a child, He is very powerful

128
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,941
and he can take us to that level

129
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,991
where the Spirit resides.

130
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:03,321
Now the first thing that we have to know is about sex.

131
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,591
In the west, sex has become an obsession with people

132
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,206
as if it's a religion.

133
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:26,806
And if they cannot be sexually active

134
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:30,601
or if they are not having any sex activities,

135
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,731
they think they are all wasted.

136
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:36,471
They are good for nothing.

137
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:48,221
The whole atmosphere is built up like that through your medias, through your televisions

138
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:51,051
All kinds of things are put in to your head to feel

139
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:53,766
that your inferior if you are not dealing with sex.

140
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,311
And when we get attached to

141
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:22,771
this kind of a stupid idea that our life is only meant for sex enjoyment,

142
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:28,006
we start descending downward instead of descending upward.

143
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,366
What is that? Lizard

144
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,371
I don't like them very much

145
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:43,431
Alright, doesn't matter

146
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:46,871
It's a very different type of a lizard than an Indian

147
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,471
Better looking

148
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,291
Yogi : Smaller

149
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,121
Ah, she's green.

150
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:02,546
You don't get green. Alright so

151
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,806
So, to descend down

152
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:18,061
is very easy,

153
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,681
to fall is the easiest.

154
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,431
And when

155
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:25,931
the idea of sex all the time hover our mind,

156
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:29,361
our attention gets so much filled with it,

157
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,931
that even with our eyes, with our thoughts,

158
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:35,571
with our mind, our head, everything it is nothing but

159
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,426
just this filth in our head.

160
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:05,566
So, for the young people, when they get married

161
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:10,321
the best thing is, they should realize the importance of sex

162
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,941
is not so great.

163
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,711
And they should start

164
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:32,141
understanding that it is not a sin

165
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,901
but it is not also everything.

166
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,981
Then also women must know that

167
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,071
they are on this earth to give

168
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:51,051
place for the Realized souls to be born.

169
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,781
And in the name of Ganesha, they should have innocent children.

170
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:13,611
But when these Realized sould are born in the west, they do not keep their pure form

171
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:16,541
because the parents are in a funny shape.

172
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,761
And though the Ganesha has done all the best

173
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:35,031
that is possible to get the best children

174
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:37,971
in the womb of the Realized mothers,

175
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:41,611
they get really absolutely affected.

176
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,601
And we start hurting them by our

177
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,901
ill behaviour, by our wrong ideas.

178
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:19,111
So when you are pregnant, one should read Ganesha's stotram,

179
00:22:19,111 --> 00:22:22,041
must do puja of Ganesha and try to remain pure

180
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,901
as far as sex is concerned.

181
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:41,091
Moreover, we start thinking about

182
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:42,866
something that is so spontaneous.

183
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,681
What is there to think about it? Just an Indian won't understand this

184
00:22:55,681 --> 00:23:00,151
they won't understand in the village what is there to think about sex, it's so spontaneous.

185
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:02,206
It's like thinking about going to the bathroom.

186
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:23,226
It's a joyless pursuit and imaginary ideas

187
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,141
So one has to be very very alert,

188
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,071
that we are now saints, we are Yogis

189
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,171
and we are not going to waste our energy

190
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:41,431
in this kind of a joyless pursuit.

191
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,171
What is it there?

192
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,001
What's it?

193
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,101
It's a beetle, Ah

194
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,371
can't be afraid of beetles.

195
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,206
Alright, now

196
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:19,226
when we understand our life as so important,

197
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:21,726
for the imancipation of humanity,

198
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,031
for giving light to others,

199
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:31,251
for saving the whole world from the disaster, it is awaiting

200
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:33,131
and we realize that.

201
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,361
How can we waste?

202
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:56,061
How can we waste our energy, our attention into such a

203
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,361
spontaneous thing like that?

204
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,151
Specially for old people

205
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:13,001
there is no need to think about it anymore, forget it,

206
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,171
you are very happy that you are alright there.

207
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:19,061
Now, just devote your time to something great.

208
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:33,101
Actually, I miss nothing, whatsoever.

209
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,071
The spiritual joy

210
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,401
is so much greater

211
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,971
and it's so eternal that we should not seek all this.

212
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:52,011
On the contrary, whenever such thoughts come in we should sublimate it.

213
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:12,291
You will see once you start doing that, your

214
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:15,191
your sensitivity, your perception

215
00:26:15,886 --> 00:26:18,546
joy will be thousand fold.

216
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:33,146
And gradually

217
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:34,801
you will get over it

218
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,891
because it is such a

219
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:46,221
temporary pleasure,

220
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:48,811
that's why people run after it.

221
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,651
If it was something of eternal nature, one would not

222
00:26:51,761 --> 00:26:52,761
again go to it.

223
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:08,501
But it is in human nature, it is natural, so

224
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:14,471
it is being sanctified and one can have it till you are young.

225
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,901
But then gradually, you must make your pure

226
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,431
existence so purified

227
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,981
that they should not enter into your mind at all.

228
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:51,691
So when you catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesha, which are very tiny sweet little things,

229
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:54,901
you should know that you should be yourself little lightweight,

230
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,831
otherwise, if you are having all these problems upon yourself,

231
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,811
He wouldn't like and He might just  again

232
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:02,931
throw you down.

233
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:23,641
And that your attention should be purified by attention towards Shri Ganesh

234
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,801
Only people who are

235
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,571
this kind really also enjoy sex,

236
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:40,561
otherwise they cannot because they have so many perversions in their heads,

237
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:42,906
I don't know what are they upto.

238
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:58,026
And that is why

239
00:28:58,271 --> 00:28:59,541
they rise above,

240
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:04,441
that is why they get fed up with it

241
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:05,711
after sometime.

242
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:20,791
And they mature properly in their own age, otherwise you will find even

243
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,201
eighty years old people

244
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,881
shaking their hand on their sticks you see,

245
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:28,471
still looking at young girls,

246
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:29,661
it's something I cannot understand.

247
00:29:44,091 --> 00:29:45,971
And they look so stupid,

248
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,351
they look so stupid.

249
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:49,866
Everybody laughs at them.

250
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:56,906
And young people make fun of them.

251
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:03,101
But they feel as if they have become

252
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,961
something like a hero or

253
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:08,111
in that old age suddenly.

254
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,851
Like they showed once a

255
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,181
film

256
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,331
of all the very, very old eighty, eighty above,

257
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,181
actors and actresses coming to do shake dance

258
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:31,221
in a party. To do shake dance

259
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,906
in a party.

260
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,351
And from the limousine, they got down

261
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:47,911
since then they were shaking.

262
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:59,711
And when they came and tried to show they were very much in love and all that, looking

263
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:04,371
so stupid that those who watched them were laughing and were rolling with laughter.

264
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,871
It is so ridiculously clownish,

265
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,301
but they said we are honest.

266
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,081
So even if you do these things

267
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:48,406
openly or with secrecy or whichever way you do it, it's stupid.

268
00:31:57,246 --> 00:31:58,506
And that is how,

269
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:02,271
when you are not matured of your age

270
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,031
you are not respected by your children,respected by

271
00:32:06,031 --> 00:32:10,321
anybody who is younger. He thinks you are stupid because you are not matured enough.

272
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,161
Now when the fruits are

273
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:26,321
in the flower form,

274
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:31,051
that time all the fertilization takes place.

275
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:35,321
Then at the fruit time they grow as fruits and not as flowers anymore.

276
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:51,641
Flowers become fruits

277
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:56,321
At the time of flower stage, there is fertilization,

278
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:59,731
but not at the time of fruit, you see. Fruit trys to grow

279
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:03,226
Fertilization is where they

280
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:30,626
So this is what,

281
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:33,601
that maturity is very important

282
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:38,386
to reach, that is only possible if you really catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesh.

283
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:55,351
So you remain innocent even in your old age.

284
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:04,871
With all this understanding,

285
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,371
Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

286
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,791
by which we mature.

287
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,361
So that thing is there

288
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,611
in the room, I think I have got that thing

289
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,361
decoration.

290
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:26,731
Now the people

291
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:31,051
who are indulging into lust

292
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:32,731
have to

293
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:37,371
see that they mature in their understanding.

294
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:50,921
Then the people who are too much possessive

295
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:56,981
of their things, of their possessions, of their

296
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:07,666
children must also understand that Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

297
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,126
to understand,

298
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,681
that this is not yours.

299
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:38,646
So what is carbon is nothing but a burnt wood, that is

300
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:40,506
everything is burnt away.

301
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,226
The wisdom that you get

302
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:59,741
is that everything that you see as your own is not yours.

303
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:06,401
Everything you have to leave here and go away. You can't take even this paper with you.

304
00:36:22,091 --> 00:36:24,381
So why are we attached to them,

305
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:30,651
let us use it for its own purpose for expressing our joy.

306
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:42,391
Now, I'll give you a very

307
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,271
beautiful example.

308
00:36:48,851 --> 00:36:52,071
See now how Ritambara Pragnya works.

309
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,991
See, this necklace that you see

310
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:00,806
was made in Italy

311
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,186
by some realized soul.

312
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:12,981
Then,

313
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:15,361
this necklace,

314
00:37:16,261 --> 00:37:19,411
I don't know how it went to India.

315
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,011
Now,

316
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:30,871
the Australians wanted to give me

317
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:32,171
a

318
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:33,921
Mangal sutra of

319
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:36,541
diamond like this, the other one I have.

320
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,541
And they had collected ten thousand rupees,

321
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,861
but even half of this size we could not buy

322
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:53,991
because there was only one shop open on a sunday.

323
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:55,621
situation

324
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,761
So I looked around and I found

325
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:13,791
a very nice gold Mangal sutra

326
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,721
made out of coral because Australia is Ganesha's land.

327
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:38,491
I felt tremendous vibrations around,

328
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:40,221
so I went on the back

329
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:44,691
because they said, "it is very cheap". So, I said, " alright"

330
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:47,221
And there this was placed

331
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,331
and these earrings there.

332
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,741
So, we bought all these,

333
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,811
plus the Mangal sutra,

334
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,781
plus one more piece which I have in coral

335
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,781
in the same amount.

336
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,731
It's not yet finished,

337
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:26,391
then it was misplaced

338
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,231
in Australia,it went into my box

339
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,101
which was to come to London.

340
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,666
So, I couldn't bring it to London

341
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:56,946
Now, Thelma came

342
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,251
from Australia

343
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,881
and she brought it with her

344
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:04,911
and it is now in Italy

345
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:05,911
by the artist

346
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:09,111
whose spirit could be seeing this

347
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,651
to gratify him, not only that,

348
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:16,111
but also that it is the day of Shri Ganesh

349
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,686
from Australia.

350
00:40:41,626 --> 00:40:43,266
Yes, from Australia,

351
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,261
this is sent as your brothers,

352
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:49,381
the thing they bought made in Italy,

353
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:52,906
on the day of Shri Ganesh. Can you have more combinations?

354
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:23,326
Your brothers and sisters

355
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:26,301
from Ganesha's place, you see, the Ganas

356
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:28,421
have sent it to

357
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:29,931
Devas here

358
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:33,941
for the celebration, you are the Devas and they are the Ganas.

359
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:52,941
And these are ten,

360
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:57,051
ten, eleven and twelve.

361
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:00,341
So this represents the heart,

362
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:04,821
the dharma, ten

363
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,191
and all

364
00:42:06,246 --> 00:42:08,506
put together is the heart.

365
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:16,106
The whole of Europe

366
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:28,131
and in addition to these two is the twelve, it's the heart : England.

367
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,291
All are represented here

368
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:46,281
Now you should be able to read through

369
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:49,971
the beautiful working of

370
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:52,131
Ritambara Pragnya which is very subtle.

371
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,151
And then you'll start enjoying the little, little things

372
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:58,001
it plays to make you very happy

373
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:02,491
and to give you what some artist must have done it long time back,

374
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:05,411
which his desire was

375
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:06,801
to fulfill.

376
00:43:31,721 --> 00:43:34,631
No, this is also we should say,

377
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:36,086
is the work of Shri Ganesha.

378
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:47,526
He resides as Omkara in the Ritambara Pragnya.

379
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:58,931
He resides on the electromagnetic forces as the vibrations in the matter,

380
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:06,691
in every atom.

381
00:44:10,846 --> 00:44:16,826
He resides in every ripple of our emotions which gives us joy.

382
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:34,766
And he resides

383
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:39,211
as a beautiful decoration of the Kundalini because

384
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:42,131
she has the red and gold colour just like my sari.

385
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,706
So, as the colour of Kundalini he resides.

386
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:01,446
But at Sahastrara,

387
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:05,601
he becomes the joy.

388
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:13,671
At Muladhara as the fragrance,

389
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:21,421
and every memory of mine

390
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,811
should give you fragrance because he is the Lord of memory.

391
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:37,041
So, this is how he manages everything

392
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,511
so beautifully.

393
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:46,431
He is such a innocent

394
00:45:48,731 --> 00:45:51,171
person who plays around

395
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:52,411
his beauty

396
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:54,086
to make us happy.

397
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:07,221
Our children should also make us very happy

398
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,606
if we have brought them up properly.

399
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:18,486
But if we have been

400
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:21,181
all the time busy with lust and greed,

401
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,346
the children cannot be good children.

402
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:36,706
They cannot represent

403
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,161
Ganesha tatwa as it should be.

404
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:49,741
So, today is a great day

405
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:52,581
that we are establishing Shri Ganesha

406
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:53,851
in Italy.

407
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:05,511
We did this in Switzerland

408
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:07,246
and now in Italy.

409
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:14,246
This should give you

410
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:15,821
the power of innocence,

411
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:19,231
the power of purity,

412
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:20,231
the power of wisdom.

413
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:33,711
It should give you the art of playfulness of joy.

414
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:53,051
And that special quality of turning everything into something

415
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:54,241
fragrant.

416
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:03,911
May God bless you all.
