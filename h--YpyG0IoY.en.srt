1
00:04:54,291 --> 00:05:03,542
Today it’s a great day because Sahasrara day and

2
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,917
Mother’s day have come together.

3
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:14,333
That’s a very Sahaj happening, I think,

4
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,625
and that is what we have to understand,

5
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:30,792
how Sahasrara and the motherhood go together.

6
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:43,542
Sahasrara was definitely opened

7
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,250
and Mother had to do it,

8
00:05:52,834 --> 00:06:00,250
because formerly those people who came on this earth

9
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:08,083
tried to teach people about Dharma,

10
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:11,834
to bring them to the central path,

11
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,959
to the straightforward path of ascent.

12
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,125
They tried everything,

13
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,709
whatever way they thought was good for a particular community,

14
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,333
particular area, particular country.

15
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:33,375
They talked about it and lots of books came out of it.

16
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:46,667
But instead of all these books creating people of religious,

17
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,709
spiritual and a united nature,

18
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:58,667
created people who were all against each other.

19
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:04,125
Absurd, it’s an absurd thing, but it happened.

20
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,625
So all these books that were written,

21
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:16,041
all this knowledge that was given, was all misused by human beings

22
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:24,500
just to get their own power, I should say;

23
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,917
so it was all a power-orientated, also money-orientated, game going on.

24
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:41,375
When we see the outcome of all these religions, we feel it’s all empty.

25
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:52,208
They talk of love, they talk of compassion but it is all for a purpose.

26
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:56,458
It is all a political game sometimes,

27
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:03,458
because they still feel that they should have power,

28
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,500
not the spiritual power but the worldly power,

29
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,250
so that they can dominate the whole world.

30
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:18,166
So this domination started working so much in the human mind

31
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:23,750
that we had lots of wars, killings, all kinds of things.

32
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And when it subsided I felt that now,

33
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,834
maybe, opening Sahasrara might help people to see the truth.

34
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:43,000
At the level of Sahasrara, you know the truth.

35
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:51,917
So all kinds of illusions, all kinds of misunderstandings,

36
00:08:51,917 --> 00:09:01,834
all kinds of self-imposed ignorance, they all have to disappear.

37
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,917
Because what you know is the truth.

38
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:14,583
The truth is not sharp, it’s not harsh,

39
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,500
it is not something which is difficult to assimilate.

40
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:28,291
People thought truth must be something that would be just very

41
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,834
damaging or could be very harsh,

42
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:39,750
could create problems between human beings, which it should not have,

43
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:44,375
it should not have, it was not meant to be.

44
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,000
But whenever they talked of truth

45
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,959
the people used it for a wrong purpose.

46
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,625
It’s something special about human beings

47
00:09:54,875 --> 00:10:05,750
that they start using things for a wrong attitude, for a wrong message,

48
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,583
and try to use it for their own purpose.

49
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,709
It’s such a common thing with human beings

50
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,625
that they want to have power over other men.

51
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,458
Now I’ve seen in My own country when

52
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,750
people wanted to have separate nations.

53
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:30,000
Those people who wanted to have separate nations actually did it,

54
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,041
not to achieve anything great but just because they can become,

55
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:38,291
those people who wanted, few of them,

56
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,166
they'll become something great in their own country.

57
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:45,709
So they never wanted to be in a country where

58
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,417
they may not rise to that height.

59
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,166
So then, they separated those countries and by separating I have seen

60
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:58,125
all these countries are suffering, suffering very much.

61
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,291
There’s no growth, there are financial problems,

62
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,500
all kinds of problems are there and

63
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,709
also the main country is suffering because they have now developed

64
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:15,041
enmity and all this is working out against the main country.

65
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:20,999
So to have a separatist idea itself is against Sahaj.

66
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:27,959
Say, for example, a flower growing on the tree looks very nice,

67
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:33,625
it develops there, matures there and it produces seeds also.

68
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:40,709
But supposing you cut the flower and take it away, then what happens?

69
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,333
The tree loses the flower, no doubt,

70
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:47,500
but mostly it is the loss of the flower.

71
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,375
Now this they did, all of them, and when they did it,

72
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,709
you see, what is the result?

73
00:11:53,709 --> 00:12:03,917
That people who tried to have their own country, their own domain,

74
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:11,583
they were killed, murdered, abused and some of them are in jail.

75
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,041
So the attitude, even outside Sahaja Yoga,

76
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,333
has shown that it doesn’t help.

77
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:25,458
So we must learn to be one.

78
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:30,166
If after Sahaja Yoga, after your realization,

79
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:36,709
if you do not understand this message that we all have to be one,

80
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,500
one single unit, one single body;

81
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,250
if we cannot be, if you are identified with other things,

82
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,750
then it’s no way you have grown, you have not matured.

83
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,709
A very important point on Sahasrara day, one has to understand,

84
00:12:54,709 --> 00:13:00,041
that all the seven chakras have their peethas in the Sahasrara.

85
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,041
All the seven chakras.

86
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,959
They are nicely settled down in the midriff of your brain

87
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,458
and they act through that area, wherever they are,

88
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,500
on the chakras and work it out.

89
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,834
Now all these seven chakras become one,

90
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,375
I should say, or go into unison.

91
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:33,166
Complete integration takes place in these centers.

92
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:41,125
Because these are governed by these seven main chakras,

93
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,959
we can call them, you can call them by any name,

94
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,000
and they govern all the other chakras

95
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,875
and because they are in unison, completely integrated,

96
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:56,291
that’s why all your chakras are integrated.

97
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:05,999
Is the peethas which are enlightened, I should say, by Kundalini,

98
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:15,250
also blessed by the Divine power, immediately become integrated.

99
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:20,250
They say that like pearls in one string.

100
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,709
It’s even more than that, it’s more than that,

101
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:31,208
all these peethas within you get integrated in such a manner

102
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:37,291
as if there’s no difference in their manifestation.

103
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:44,417
Supposing you have a chakra which is not alright,

104
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,792
something wrong physically, mentally, emotionally,

105
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,667
whatever it is, the other chakras try

106
00:14:49,667 --> 00:15:00,291
to help this sick chakra and try to evolve a personality

107
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:05,041
of a Sahaja Yogi in a way that he’s integrated.

108
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,999
Now integration within yourself is very important,

109
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,208
unless and until you are integrated within yourself

110
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,166
you cannot be integrated outside.

111
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,625
And the within yourself the integration

112
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,208
is such a blessing of Sahaja Yoga that a person

113
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:28,542
who gets this realization becomes a personality

114
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:33,417
which is above the normal personality.

115
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:38,999
It is not attached to all the negative forces,

116
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,875
the destructive forces.

117
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:45,125
It just gives up so many things

118
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,250
which normally very difficult to give up.

119
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,375
All these seven chakras, that we have within ourselves,

120
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:59,875
are then guided by these peethas in unison.

121
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,959
Just the help that comes from this unison

122
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,542
helps all the chakras to get completely integrated.

123
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,291
As it is we are not integrated because

124
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:18,834
our mind goes on one side, our body goes on another side,

125
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:23,291
our heart goes on another side, our emotions are different.

126
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:27,542
We do not know which is the right thing to do,

127
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,166
what is the best thing to do.

128
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,625
But after realization, in the light of the Spirit,

129
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:38,041
you get the truth and you know what is to be done.

130
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,542
For example, after self realization

131
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,542
you can judge people on their vibrations.

132
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,709
You don’t have to use your brains for that,

133
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,250
just on your vibrations,

134
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,750
immediately you know what’s wrong with yourself and with others.

135
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,875
So here it is a double correction, one is you see your own being,

136
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,166
your own self, your self knowledge comes to you

137
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,667
and secondly you can also make out another person,

138
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,875
what sort of a thing he’s done.

139
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,959
If somebody is not Sahaj and claims to be Sahaj,

140
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,500
you can easily find out that he’s not Sahaj,

141
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
his behaviour is not Sahaj.

142
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,542
So the best thing is for all of us is

143
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:29,667
to get this integration absolutely working out within ourselves.

144
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:34,166
We should not shun it but we should accept that

145
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:38,875
whatever defects we had, whatever wrong we have been doing,

146
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:45,500
what wrong thinking we had, whatever destructive we had taken to,

147
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,750
all this has to disappear because you are Sahaja Yogis.

148
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,375
Sahaja Yogis have a special job to be done.

149
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:02,041
They’re not like other people who are just working for money,

150
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,542
working for power, working for domination.

151
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,625
You are not.

152
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:12,291
You are working in Sahaja Yoga for the emancipation of humanity.

153
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,625
So whole thing is that this Sahasrara

154
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:22,166
is a global field where we enter in.

155
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:29,041
We enter into a global field and when we are there we just become,

156
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,667
ourselves, a global personality.

157
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:36,333
So all these minor things like your race, your country,

158
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,166
your religion and all these,

159
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,667
which are artificial barriers between human beings,

160
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:48,083
just drops out and you become a realized soul,

161
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:53,083
and you know what is humanity, you understand the humanity.

162
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,625
This has to happen in all the Sahaja Yogis.

163
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,291
When they are together.

164
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,458
They should understand that we are not,

165
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,083
no more ordinary human beings,

166
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,792
we are special people chosen for a very special work

167
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
which is the most important thing today.

168
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,750
Now, as you know what is going on in Kali yuga,

169
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,333
I need not describe all that to you,

170
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:21,417
but what is the light of the Spirit which is going to show you

171
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:27,000
what you can do to remove the ills of Kali Yuga.

172
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,333
Starting right from yourself,

173
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,917
you just see for yourself with great amusement,

174
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:37,083
what you have been doing was all stupid.

175
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:40,417
You should not have done that but you have been doing,

176
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:42,999
so it’s alright, you can forgive others who are doing it.

177
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,917
And you’ll understand that those who have been doing it

178
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,875
have been doing all this out of ignorance.

179
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,750
But now you have your Sahasrara open.

180
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,792
In the open Sahasrara you are getting,

181
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:02,041
or the Divine is pouring Its grace all the time.

182
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:08,208
With that reception, with that, we should say,

183
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,542
the nourishing of your Sahasrara,

184
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:15,083
what happens is something really great.

185
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,542
One thing happens that you get detached from yourself,

186
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:22,999
you can see yourself, you can see your past,

187
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,917
you can understand yourself that you have been doing

188
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:32,208
so many wrong things and misunderstanding people.

189
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:38,166
This sometimes takes you too far away from yourself.

190
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:42,542
But once this light comes and the Sahasrara is nourished,

191
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,333
in that light you see clearly

192
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,208
what wrong you have been doing to yourself.

193
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,041
Then, as a person, you can see your faults

194
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,291
but also you see the faults of your society, where you live.

195
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,667
I’ve seen immediately after people get their realization

196
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,041
they start telling Me,

197
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:06,166
“Mother, I was a Christian but see, this is Christianity”.

198
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,333
Somebody will say, “Mother, I was very patriotic,

199
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,208
but I see now what is patriotism is”.

200
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:18,125
Like, everybody starts seeing its own background,

201
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:26,083
its own styles in which he has lived and just gets out of it.

202
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:30,917
And once you are out of it it’s no more identified with you.

203
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,709
And it’s such a spontaneous happening.

204
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,458
Only thing, you have to learn to be spontaneous.

205
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:41,333
And that’s what I find that, in Sahaj, people still,

206
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:48,250
though they are out of this illusion, this ocean of illusion,

207
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:53,999
still sometimes their one leg is still there in the ocean

208
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:57,542
and still they’re pulling it out and pushing it back.

209
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,792
That should not be.

210
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,208
That is only because people don’t meditate.

211
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:08,250
Now to say you must meditate, people think it’s a kind of a ritual,

212
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:14,208
or maybe a kind of a style of Sahaja Yoga, no.

213
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:20,542
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

214
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:25,208
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

215
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:30,458
To achieve that height of detachment,

216
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:37,458
of understanding is only through meditation.

217
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,999
So what happens in meditation is

218
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:45,917
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

219
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,458
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

220
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:58,125
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

221
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:03,250
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

222
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:07,583
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

223
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,792
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

224
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:14,458
But meditation is very important for all of you

225
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:18,000
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

226
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:23,208
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

227
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:27,542
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

228
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:31,792
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

229
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,375
you’ll have no vibrations

230
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:37,083
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

231
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,417
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

232
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:44,375
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

233
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:49,125
and the one who has not been meditating.

234
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,959
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

235
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:56,083
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

236
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,709
Meditation is the only way you can

237
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:06,250
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

238
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,999
There’s no other way.

239
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:12,041
I cannot find any other way but meditation

240
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:18,083
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

241
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,834
For example, I would say that Myself,

242
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,625
whatever I have done is this,

243
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,875
that I have been able to find out a method

244
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:30,083
how to give Self-realization to masses.

245
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,166
But that doesn’t mean that if I give to masses,

246
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,959
they are all Sahaja Yogis, no.

247
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,834
You must have seen whenever you have your programs,

248
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,083
people get realization when I’m there

249
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:50,500
and they come to programs for a while and then they drop out.

250
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
The reason is, they have not meditated.

251
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:57,041
If they had meditated they would have known

252
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:03,041
what is their quality, what are they.

253
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:11,500
Without meditation you don’t understand what is best for you.

254
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,999
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

255
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,208
that you’ll meditate every night,

256
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:21,166
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

257
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:25,500
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

258
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,999
you are in contact with this Divine power.

259
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:37,166
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

260
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:42,166
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

261
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:46,375
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

262
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:49,417
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

263
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:57,083
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

264
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:02,083
which is another great blessing to us.

265
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:07,417
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

266
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,291
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

267
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:18,041
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

268
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,999
you might get this and that.

269
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:24,291
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

270
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:30,500
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

271
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:38,166
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

272
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,750
This is the truth.

273
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,500
They say God is love and God is truth,

274
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:49,041
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

275
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,750
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

276
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,542
you have for your family, attached.

277
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,875
Attached love is not truth.

278
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,166
If you are attached to somebody

279
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:05,083
then you never see the bad points of that person.

280
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,208
If you are angry with somebody,

281
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,542
then you can never see the good points of that person.

282
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:14,792
But it’s a complete detached love

283
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:18,083
and that love is extremely powerful

284
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,999
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

285
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,542
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

286
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,291
his personality will improve,

287
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:33,667
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

288
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:37,667
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

289
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:50,291
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

290
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:55,208
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

291
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:59,208
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

292
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,166
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

293
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:07,667
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

294
00:28:07,917 --> 00:28:09,792
It just happens that you get detached.

295
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,208
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

296
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:17,542
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

297
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:23,083
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

298
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,542
that is not the point.

299
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:29,000
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

300
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,166
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

301
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:38,458
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

302
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,542
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

303
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,750
In that state you are dealing with people,

304
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,583
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

305
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:59,000
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

306
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,000
and that involvement which you had before

307
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:07,542
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

308
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,208
what the truth is, about any situation.

309
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,583
So this detachment helps.

310
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,792
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

311
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:23,959
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

312
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:29,583
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

313
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:34,041
How can you have compassion for another person?

314
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:38,333
Because if you feel for another person

315
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,834
then only you can solve the problem”.

316
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:47,125
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

317
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:52,917
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

318
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,375
The person is crying, you are also crying,

319
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:59,250
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

320
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,458
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

321
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:08,458
So to have detached in no way means

322
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:13,500
you do not feel for another person.

323
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,625
You do feel.

324
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:19,834
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

325
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:25,041
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

326
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,834
But that your feeling is so detached

327
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:33,917
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

328
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,000
First we must have full faith

329
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,375
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

330
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,709
As soon as you are detached.

331
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:47,166
You say, “You do it” - finished.

332
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,125
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

333
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,500
it’s You who is going to do it,”

334
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,834
whole thing changes completely.

335
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:58,709
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

336
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:02,125
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

337
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:06,834
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

338
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:12,458
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

339
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:15,333
you are the one who’s going to do it,

340
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:20,500
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

341
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,166
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

342
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,583
it will work out.

343
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:29,709
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

344
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,000
especially when we find that people

345
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,917
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

346
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:39,625
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

347
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,041
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

348
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:48,125
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

349
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,834
Why should we worry?

350
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:52,834
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

351
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,125
why should we worry?

352
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,375
Why should we think about it?

353
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,500
Just leave it to the Divine power.

354
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:04,000
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

355
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,917
which is very difficult for human beings,

356
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,166
because they live with their ego,

357
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,375
they live with their conditionings;

358
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:16,375
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

359
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:21,959
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

360
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,583
Krishna has said in His Gita:

361
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:28,625
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

362
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,709
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

363
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:35,333
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

364
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:39,625
of a husband, of a member of the society,

365
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,917
all of them have their own dharma.

366
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,500
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

367
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:51,041
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

368
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:55,625
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

369
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:59,250
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

370
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:03,500
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

371
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,625
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

372
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,709
That’s not necessary.

373
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:14,709
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

374
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:18,041
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

375
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:22,250
to rise to that state of consciousness.

376
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
That is what we have to achieve.

377
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:28,709
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

378
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,625
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

379
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,250
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

380
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:42,375
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

381
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:46,625
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

382
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:56,375
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

383
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,834
Just put it on the Divine power.

384
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:03,458
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

385
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:08,000
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

386
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:14,333
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

387
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,000
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

388
00:34:18,834 --> 00:34:23,792
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

389
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:29,875
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

390
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:35,291
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

391
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:40,250
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

392
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:44,000
so he was working in a bank.

393
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,583
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

394
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,041
and he had to go by boat.

395
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,875
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

396
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,583
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

397
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:04,166
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

398
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:08,750
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

399
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,625
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

400
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:15,625
to stop all these things happening.

401
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,125
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

402
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,750
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

403
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:26,625
And it was surprising, people told Me that

404
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,875
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

405
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,959
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

406
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,166
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

407
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,417
He went to another island where he had to go,

408
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:44,625
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

409
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,750
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,166
everything started pouring down.

411
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:54,875
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

412
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,166
is worked out through the Divine power.

413
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:02,750
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

414
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,375
we can manage ourselves.

415
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,999
Once you have that kind of a thing,

416
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,709
you are not yet that much developed,

417
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:12,625
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

418
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:16,500
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

419
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,542
because you have guidelines.

420
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:23,709
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

421
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:28,166
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

422
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,166
how much they must have struggled.

423
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,542
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

424
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,250
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

425
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,083
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

426
00:36:41,709 --> 00:36:44,999
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

427
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:50,625
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

428
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,417
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

429
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:59,999
they had such knowledge of their own

430
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,625
that they achieved through their meditative process.

431
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,709
And the way they have written books,

432
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:09,750
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

433
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:17,999
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

434
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:22,834
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

435
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,750
nobody was to tell them.

436
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,083
But one thing with them was

437
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:33,667
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

438
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,041
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

439
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:44,083
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

440
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:48,083
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

441
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,667
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:55,291
Thoughts are coming all the time,

443
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:59,959
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

444
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,750
react to this and react to that

445
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,083
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

446
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,083
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

447
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:10,875
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

448
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:15,291
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

449
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:20,834
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

450
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,041
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

451
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,041
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

452
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,375
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

453
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:35,542
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

454
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,417
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

455
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,875
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

456
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:45,959
And these are so much built up within you,

457
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:50,166
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

458
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,999
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

459
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,750
First one is, when it is conditioning,

460
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,417
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

461
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,166
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

462
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:06,625
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

463
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,667
That’s the conditioning part of it.

464
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,625
Conditioning can be of many types.

465
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,500
But the ego part of it is that,

466
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,999
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

467
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:19,083
I must be able to rule everyone.”

468
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,333
These two things are there in the mind

469
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,917
which are all the time crossing over.

470
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:32,750
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

471
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:37,667
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

472
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:43,208
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

473
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:48,208
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

474
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:52,291
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

475
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,583
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

476
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:57,583
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

477
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:01,000
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

478
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:04,417
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

479
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,875
“I’m an extrovert”.

480
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,667
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

481
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:13,667
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

482
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:17,542
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

483
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:23,542
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

484
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:29,583
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

485
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:34,208
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

486
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:36,999
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

487
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:40,917
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

488
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:45,125
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

489
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,000
this Agnya can be opened out.

490
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,000
With surrendering to the Divine,

491
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,208
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

492
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:57,208
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

493
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:02,125
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

494
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:08,999
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

495
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:13,583
Your connection of Sahasrara with

496
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,875
the All-pervading Power is established.

497
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:22,667
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

498
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:27,834
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

499
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:31,542
is the real knowledge about everything.

500
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:35,667
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

501
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,333
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

502
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:43,125
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

503
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:48,458
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

504
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:56,000
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

505
00:41:56,333 --> 00:42:04,333
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

506
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,583
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

507
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:13,083
Kabira has said something great about this,

508
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:20,709
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

509
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,458
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

510
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:33,458
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

511
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,458
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

512
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:40,834
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

513
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:44,375
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

514
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:52,667
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

515
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,083
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

516
00:42:56,333 --> 00:43:00,458
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

517
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:06,458
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

518
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,917
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

519
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:17,333
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

520
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:21,834
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

521
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,959
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

522
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,000
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

523
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,458
But the greatest thing happend to you

524
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,667
that you become a global personality.

525
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:39,083
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

526
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:43,709
of every other nation where they have problems.

527
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,333
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

528
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,959
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

529
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,959
maybe for media, maybe for something.

530
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:58,125
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

531
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,000
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

532
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:09,000
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

533
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:14,500
that it, whatever disturbs you,

534
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:19,125
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

535
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,333
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

536
00:44:23,709 --> 00:44:27,834
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

537
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:31,041
if you are a global person.

538
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:32,792
If you are a global person then

539
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:38,125
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

540
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,917
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

541
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:47,166
to act because you are purely a global personality.

542
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,500
Not attached to this, attached to that,

543
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:53,959
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

544
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,959
by this Divine power very easily.

545
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:00,000
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

546
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:04,375
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

547
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:09,125
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

548
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,834
Angry for what?

549
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,792
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -

550
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,625
as if they’re proud of their anger.

551
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,959
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

552
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,917
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

553
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,000
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

554
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,709
With anger you spoil yourself.

555
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,250
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

556
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:37,333
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

557
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:44,250
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

558
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,458
But if anything happens that angers you,

559
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,834
you should settle down and see for yourself

560
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:54,375
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

561
00:45:54,709 --> 00:46:00,750
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

562
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:03,709
You must first of all realize that you are

563
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:06,500
a special personality that your Sahasrara

564
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:09,917
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

565
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:14,375
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

566
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:29,500
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

567
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,166
You are not an ordinary person.

568
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:37,375
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

569
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:43,125
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

570
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:46,125
But that should not give you any ego.

571
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:50,458
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

572
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:52,500
but it’s for understanding that

573
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,458
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

574
00:46:56,709 --> 00:47:00,959
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

575
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,625
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

576
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:06,583
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

577
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:10,875
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

578
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,875
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

579
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,125
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

580
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:23,041
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

581
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,750
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

582
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,250
It’s the Artist who is managing”.

583
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,291
And who is the Artist?

584
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:33,750
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

585
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,417
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.

586
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:39,709
You’ll be surprised,

587
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:44,709
I have got so many letters from people how Sahaj has helped them.

588
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,333
How at the right moment they got the help.

589
00:47:47,667 --> 00:47:54,208
At the point of complete destruction, how they were saved.

590
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:56,375
So many people have written to Me.

591
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,000
But I’m not surprised.

592
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:02,375
Because if you are one with the Divine, it looks after you.

593
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:06,041
It has all the powers, all the powers.

594
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:12,959
Only one power it doesn’t have, to control you.

595
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:19,291
If you want to ruin yourself, it gives you freedom, complete freedom.

596
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,375
If you want to ruin yourself, ruin.

597
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:25,875
If you don’t want to accept Divine power, alright, don’t accept.

598
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:30,500
It’s a complete freedom to do what you like with yourself.

599
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,375
That is one thing it has given and that’s why

600
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:39,417
you must curb down that freedom and respect the Divine power.

601
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:47,417
Today is, I like the day when it is a Mother’s, I should say,

602
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,959
Mother's day also,

603
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,959
because I think only a mother can work it out that way.

604
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,875
One has to have lots of patience with people.

605
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:59,291
What I’ve seen about all these great incarnations who came,

606
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:08,166
they just disappeared; in a very short time they lived, very short time.

607
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:13,500
Somebody was crucified about 33 years of age.

608
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:17,291
Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age.

609
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:21,083
Because I think they couldn’t bear the way people were stupid.

610
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,875
They couldn’t see the point

611
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,792
that they could do something for human beings.

612
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:29,291
They lost their confidence I think, or maybe that they thought

613
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,500
it’s useless to work for these people.

614
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:36,291
Like that they took a position that, it’s better to disappear.

615
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,083
But Mother’s position is different,

616
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:44,500
She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child.

617
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,542
She’ll fight it out to the last to see

618
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:50,500
that the child gets all the benefits.

619
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:55,333
And this patience and this love and this forgiveness

620
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,542
is innately built in a mother,

621
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,667
see, because her attitude is very different.

622
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:11,583
Not any achievement, not any big name

623
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:15,875
or a, what you call a sort of an award or anything.

624
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:19,166
It is just she does it because she is a mother.

625
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:23,291
And that is what is the sign of any mother,

626
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,333
if she’s a real mother, at least for her own children,

627
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:30,458
she will go all out, she will work out everything

628
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:35,875
for day in and day out and try to save the child from disaster.

629
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:38,667
But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family

630
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:43,333
and for that you really had to be worked out

631
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,458
through the mother’s principle.

632
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,041
You cannot take any other principle.

633
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,291
Like there were very great warriors we had

634
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:54,417
and they have done a great job also

635
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,417
and they have worked out as warriors.

636
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,083
Then we had some who were very sacrificing.

637
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:03,083
All kinds of people there were.

638
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:07,417
They worked very hard to establish dharma in people

639
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,999
but they could not.

640
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:13,458
I thought of one thing that, no use establishing dharma.

641
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,667
First of all give them realization.

642
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,458
When in the light of the Spirit they see what’s wrong,

643
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,166
they become dharmic automatically.

644
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:28,000
The best way is to do that, not to force dharma on them.

645
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,999
Because if you put dharma on them,

646
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:34,166
they don’t know how to bear it, they can’t digest.

647
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:36,875
So this will be the best way,

648
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:42,667
is to just make them aware of their Spirit.

649
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,333
Once the light of the Spirit comes,

650
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,875
in the light they see everything clearly,

651
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,208
then no problem is there.

652
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:53,999
And that’s why this Mother’s quality is very helpful.

653
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:56,750
I mean in every country there has been

654
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,583
a manifestation of the Mother Principle, in every country,

655
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,999
and it has been depicted and said.

656
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:08,917
But later on, it was taken over by people

657
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,875
who didn’t want to talk about Mother.

658
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:14,583
Because they could not justify themselves

659
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,667
the way they were behaving.

660
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:18,333
So they said, best is not to talk of the Mother.

661
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:21,792
Also those who were very much advanced people,

662
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:25,291
very matured, who were really incarnations

663
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,667
did talk about the mother all the time.

664
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:29,875
But still talk was talk.

665
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:34,792
Now this has to be worked out as a Mother has to work it out.

666
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,333
So in your own way,

667
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:42,999
when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother.

668
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,417
More mother’s quality than the father’s quality,

669
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:51,208
that: there’s no ambition, there’s no competition,

670
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:54,875
there’s no jealousies, nothing.

671
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:59,083
Just you want your children to come up

672
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:02,792
and to grow in their spirituality.

673
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:06,417
If that is the only attitude we have,

674
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:10,792
then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel.

675
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:18,000
Because this is a very, very joy-giving thing

676
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,792
to see people growing in spirituality.

677
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,208
Not only talking about it, not only reading about it,

678
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:29,208
but actually happening, actualizing within us.

679
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,792
So this quality is very helpful

680
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,999
and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi;

681
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:41,000
to be patient, to be kind, to be humble.

682
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:44,250
But you have to correct also.

683
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,125
But there’s a way of correction of another person,

684
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:53,417
of people who are coming, not from the Divine world

685
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,125
but from the normal world.

686
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:59,917
So it’s a difficult task to correct them.

687
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,834
Some people are so hot tempered they can’t bear it.

688
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,917
Doesn’t matter, you have to forgive them.

689
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,375
But best is to concentrate on people who are simple,

690
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:14,583
who are loving, who are affectionate

691
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:19,083
and then gradually all these complicated people, also, will join.

692
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:26,333
Your way of dealing with others has to be motherly.

693
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:30,083
The motherly relationship has to be there.

694
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,417
Now I was surprised that in the western literature,

695
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:39,709
I don’t find any description of a child and a mother’s relationship,

696
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:41,000
very surprising.

697
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,208
There’s no description at all.

698
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:47,250
How the mother sees the child, how he walks, how he falls down,

699
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:51,000
then how he gets up and how he talks.

700
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,458
All kinds of beautiful things has described,

701
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:57,583
but not in the Western countries.

702
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,375
I don’t know, they never saw this point,

703
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:03,000
I think, that it is very important that to describe

704
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,667
the attention of the mother.

705
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,458
How she’s loving, how she’s kind,

706
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:14,208
how she tolerates so much nonsense and how she keeps it as a,

707
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:19,000
sort of a, forgiving thing.

708
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,667
Not just to use it against the child or to trouble.

709
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:25,542
Sometimes you have to correct, you have to tell.

710
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:28,667
But at the right time, at the right place,

711
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:35,333
if they are told, the child also sees the point, whatever is there.

712
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:39,083
The first, most convincing thing is the affection

713
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:41,125
and the love of the Mother.

714
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:47,667
She goes on forgiving and giving that assurance that

715
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:51,458
“I have a mother, nothing can happen to me.”

716
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:55,083
And this assurance works very well.

717
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:59,000
But the same assurance you have to give to other Sahaja Yogis

718
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,834
who are getting realization from you.

719
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,583
Let them feel that you are not angry with them.

720
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:07,000
They are stupid, I know.

721
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:09,792
They are sometimes violent.

722
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,834
I have gone through all kinds of people.

723
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:20,125
But the only thing that has worked is pure love.

724
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:28,208
Pure love has no attributes of expecting something.

725
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:36,959
You just give love and try to improve that person, with full attention.

726
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:42,458
But in Divine work, you don’t have to get attached to that person.

727
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:46,917
Supposing, there’s somebody who is not up to the point,

728
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,041
is also troublesome, gets angry with you, annoyed,

729
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,375
insults you and everything, so forget it!

730
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,333
There are many others.

731
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:56,583
There’s no need to run after one person,

732
00:56:56,959 --> 00:57:01,125
to get attached to that person or to make them fear.

733
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,917
Now main thing is that,

734
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:07,917
I feel all the Sahaja Yogis always feel that I’m their own,

735
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:08,959
which is a fact.

736
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:13,000
Whether I talk to you, whether I meet you or whatever it is,

737
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,333
you have to know that I’m your Mother

738
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:20,458
and any problem you have you can always tell Me.

739
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:23,458
But sometimes the way people tell Me problems also,

740
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:26,500
I feel, how low they are.

741
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,834
Their mentality is so low.

742
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:30,458
What are they asking Me?

743
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:35,625
Supposing you go to some king and ask him for, say,

744
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:38,417
half a dollar, then what will the king say?

745
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,166
“What is the matter with this person?

746
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,000
He doesn’t know what he should ask for.”

747
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,667
In the same way, one feels that way that

748
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:49,542
when you are asking anything to your Mother,

749
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,583
it should be of some value.

750
00:57:52,583 --> 00:58:01,417
Some great value, it should have the value of complete satisfaction.

751
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,542
When you ask for something it should give you complete satisfaction.

752
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:09,166
But I’ve seen people asking for this thing, for that thing.

753
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:12,458
I mean it’s to such an extent that I sometimes feel,

754
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:15,542
“Oh God, how am I getting all these people around Me

755
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:21,875
who are desiring something very low, very mean, very insipid?”

756
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:29,542
But if you are one with the Sahasrara, then Sahasrara itself works.

757
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,750
It will bring you contact with people,

758
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:39,875
in contact with such people that you are amazed how it works.

759
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,875
I went to Turkey and My experience of Turkey

760
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,750
has proved that beyond doubt.

761
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:49,083
I never expected, but the Turkish people,

762
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:53,041
of all the people of the world,

763
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:57,625
have taken to Sahaja Yoga just like a windfall.

764
00:58:57,875 --> 00:59:01,125
I can’t understand how they have accepted it.

765
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,834
And they were at least two thousand people

766
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,750
in the follow-up and people were finding it impossible

767
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,041
to get them round and tell them.

768
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:13,999
And when they had very close meetings also

769
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:17,959
they had so many people and they continued to be there.

770
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,417
Now maybe that it’s a very disturbed country

771
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:24,834
with fundamentalism very much working out.

772
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:32,250
But everywhere, every country has problems and has, we should say,

773
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:39,875
a kind of a very destructive image, every country has.

774
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:43,250
But in some countries, I don’t know how,

775
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:47,291
it sparks and once they become Sahaja Yogis, no problem.

776
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,166
There’s no problem about anything,

777
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:53,041
means they are Sahaja Yogis you see, you don’t have to tell them.

778
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:56,999
They themselves work it out, they understand it, what is it.

779
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,417
Like we have every country which has problems,

780
01:00:01,709 --> 01:00:05,291
which has people who are not of a very great level,

781
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:06,999
who are not great seekers.

782
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:11,250
Maybe in some countries, I feel, those who were great seekers are lost.

783
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:15,999
Like England, I feel that all the seekers are lost by drugs,

784
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:18,375
hippyism, all nonsense.

785
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:24,291
America is the worst of all, which is so much lost into wrong seeking;

786
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:29,625
and it’s difficult to find people there who have right seeking.

787
01:00:30,041 --> 01:00:35,625
Gradually it is working out, but still, I must say,

788
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:39,999
we should not think of any one particular country where Sahaja Yoga

789
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:44,375
is not working out so much or in some places working out so much.

790
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:49,875
It is, what we have to think, globally that Sahaja Yoga is growing.

791
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:54,417
And you are part and parcel of that society which is Sahaja Yoga.

792
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:58,208
It’s a very rare society which they never had.

793
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,959
They had one or two sufis here and there,

794
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:04,875
one or two realized souls here and there, who only suffered.

795
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:09,291
All their lives they were tortured, nobody looked at them.

796
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,417
I had great hopes about Maharashtra, but I’m so disappointed,

797
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:18,917
because they tortured all these great saints all throughout,

798
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:22,417
so badly, in such a mean manner,

799
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,166
that I think they are still paying for it.

800
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:28,999
And despite the fact that I’ve done so much work there,

801
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:34,458
what I feel is that, their karmas are not good because they still,

802
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:38,792
I would say, it’s a rotten country, become so rotten.

803
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:47,834
You can see that, the way people are behaving, whole thing is so bad.

804
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:50,500
Though Sahaja Yoga is there, no doubt,

805
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,041
but I wouldn’t say it is of that level

806
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,834
as it is in the north, north of India.

807
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,041
It’s very surprising.

808
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:00,041
North Indians never knew anything about Sahaja Yoga,

809
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:03,000
they were not such religious people either.

810
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:07,834
But how the north people have taken to Sahaja Yoga it`s very surprising.

811
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:11,917
So you can’t say where the light will show, just can’t say.

812
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,250
And wherever it shows we should accept.

813
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,917
Wherever it doesn’t show, we should not feel bad about it.

814
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,333
What can you do?

815
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:22,250
You cannot sort of break their heads for Sahasrara,

816
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,000
their Sahasrara has to be opened out.

817
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,375
And with your motherly love,

818
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:31,041
with your motherly understanding I’m sure you can do it.

819
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:37,500
Not, may not be, to the same extent in every country,

820
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:41,375
but I’m sure, as I feel that,

821
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:48,709
maybe the punyas of these great saints will work and maybe,

822
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:53,000
wherever I felt a little bit disappointed,

823
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,583
I feel that all these places will work out and Sahaja Yoga will grow.

824
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:03,125
But first and foremost is your Sahasrara.

825
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,166
Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the Divine.

826
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,041
So, your Sahasrara is extremely important.

827
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:14,834
You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara,

828
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:19,583
to cure it, to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini.

829
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:22,583
There`s no need to do many rituals but meditation

830
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:28,250
and also little bit of taking Bandhan, even now today,

831
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,291
is necessary I think, when you go out.

832
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:40,500
Because still Kali Yuga is working it’s own pangs and the Satya Yuga

833
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,625
is trying to come out.

834
01:03:42,959 --> 01:03:48,834
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

835
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:52,959
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

836
01:03:52,959 --> 01:03:55,625
very important, it’s very important.

837
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,375
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

838
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:07,125
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

839
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,500
maybe in the evening, anytime.

840
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:12,625
But you will know that you are meditating when

841
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:16,709
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

842
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:18,625
Your reaction will be zero.

843
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:20,875
Look at something you will just look at it,

844
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:23,750
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

845
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,125
You won`t react.

846
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,875
When that reaction is not there then everything,

847
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,959
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

848
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:38,041
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

849
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,750
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

850
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:43,625
you are one with the Divine.

851
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:48,166
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

852
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:53,875
every moment of your life and looks after you.

853
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:58,125
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

854
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:01,125
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

855
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:05,041
May God bless you!

856
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:35,999
Now we have so many children.

01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:40,417
I don't know what to do with all these children here.

858
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:43,166
They can just come up on the stage

859
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:47,999
and they can sing the song of Shri Ganesha.
