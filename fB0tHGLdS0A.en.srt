1
00:03:59,463 --> 00:04:05,542
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:12,883
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:17,262
We can say this is the worship

4
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:21,356
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:31,287
If you understand that all this,

6
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:38,319
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,762
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,890
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:55,101
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:04:55,302 --> 00:05:03,652
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:10,962
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:19,155
So first of all He did was to create

13
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:22,929
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,468
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,523
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,945
by the primordial sound,

17
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:40,203
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:45,927
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:05:46,318 --> 00:05:50,742
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:58,224
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:05,924
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:12,682
and for His own expression,

23
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:16,205
for His own manifestation,

24
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:20,523
for His own reflection.

25
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:26,426
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:31,528
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:37,197
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:47,208
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:53,716
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:59,190
His desire to create.

31
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,935
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word chitvilas.

32
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:08,576
Is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:12,607
Chit is, as you know is chitta, is attention.

34
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:18,795
The attention has its own joy

35
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:23,608
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:26,960
She created all the universes,

37
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:31,874
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:37,569
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,327
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:47,918
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:52,049
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,414
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,823
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:07,737
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:14,219
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:17,222
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:21,386
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:25,316
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:30,957
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,809
to see His character

51
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:38,776
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:45,375
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:51,208
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:57,633
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:03,539
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,594
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:14,657
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:19,399
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,212
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:32,407
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:38,345
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:43,181
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:47,587
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:51,728
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,306
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:59,939
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,892
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:08,080
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,603
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:10:10,804 --> 00:10:14,322
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:20,416
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:26,632
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:36,468
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,512
we do something, we can create.

75
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:47,012
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,590
leave alone anything else.

77
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:54,863
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:10:55,064 --> 00:11:00,566
we can put together and create something,

79
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:10,142
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:15,220
any power.

81
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,462
We cannot create anything.

82
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:26,438
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,040
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:35,376
Still it is gold.

85
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,712
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:43,314
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:47,087
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:52,008
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:55,086
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:11:55,287 --> 00:12:01,827
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:05,647
basically you all are the same.

92
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:11,280
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,691
also you cry the same way.

94
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:19,562
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:24,427
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:30,553
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:35,412
by some common principle of life.

98
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:41,029
And the common principle of life that is bound us

99
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:48,076
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,982
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:12:51,183 --> 00:12:53,435
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:57,778
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:07,051
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:10,535
But in the human form only

105
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:17,676
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:23,262
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:28,762
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:34,918
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:38,473
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:13:38,674 --> 00:13:45,971
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:51,159
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,281
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,433
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:06,449
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,613
who have got your realization.

116
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:14,035
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:21,176
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,957
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,848
and the enjoyment.

120
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:36,789
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,547
what should happen to you?

122
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:45,195
What should we feel?

123
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:51,489
How do we then exist?

124
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:57,490
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,352
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:02,985
that you are not there,

127
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:07,110
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,281
Secondly what happens to you

129
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:14,203
is that become just the existence.

130
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:17,164
Just the existence.

131
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,914
And that existence that you become,

132
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:25,471
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:31,091
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,130
also much before.

135
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,841
In every religion we have had people

136
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:40,513
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:45,865
For example, even you can say,

138
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:53,037
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:15:53,238 --> 00:16:00,100
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:02,772
and a khumba also,

141
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:05,858
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:12,655
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:17,468
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:22,609
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,179
Also you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,812
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,640
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:37,841
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:48,921
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:53,937
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,429
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,804
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:11,077
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:14,382
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:20,695
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:25,984
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:31,422
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,547
Also it will tell you wherever you go, like,

159
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:39,274
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,843
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:46,421
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:49,032
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:51,190
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:55,581
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,823
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,935
I said, 'Now what to do, where to go,

167
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,021
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,591
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,161
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:14,411
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:20,325
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:24,359
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,466
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:31,132
So the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,241
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,615
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:43,948
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:49,964
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,716
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:57,216
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,513
and we have to respect it.

182
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,802
I've already told you many a times

183
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:04,896
about how human beings were formed

184
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:12,047
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:15,305
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:18,742
All this leads us to understand

187
00:19:18,943 --> 00:19:23,591
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:30,141
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,055
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,196
where you have become yourself.

191
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,540
You know yourself.

192
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:43,797
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:51,302
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:19:53,677 --> 00:20:00,426
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:35,304
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:42,622
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:52,504
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:58,998
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:02,920
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:06,623
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:14,605
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:24,395
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:29,326
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:35,456
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,998
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:44,709
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,826
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:53,645
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:58,603
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,692
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:06,559
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,043
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:16,715
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,090
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:28,039
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,485
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:40,031
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:47,798
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:53,751
that It is the One that has given you intelligence;

220
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,923
It is the One that has given you wisdom;

221
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:01,093
It is the One which has given you

222
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:04,275
whatever you have as you were singing that,

223
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:08,827
"Whatever we have is given by You."

224
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:13,533
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:18,189
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,087
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:27,048
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:34,913
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,883
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,492
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:55,226
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:59,289
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:05,156
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:08,797
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:11,844
It's such a relationship.

236
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:15,172
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:20,633
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:27,735
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:39,162
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:44,584
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:50,128
and over your development.

242
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:58,174
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,795
Now

244
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:13,525
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,457
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:18,059
you may.

247
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,192
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,497
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:26,966
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:33,396
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:37,529
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,318
because it has a reaction.

253
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:49,536
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:25:49,768 --> 00:26:05,637
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:11,536
into the water automatically,

256
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:19,479
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:24,512
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:27,903
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:33,197
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:43,569
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:50,160
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:57,345
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:26:57,978 --> 00:27:03,324
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:07,363
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:12,082
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:18,587
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,691
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:27,347
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:29,785
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:34,502
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:37,447
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:41,635
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,737
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:27:44,938 --> 00:27:51,609
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:57,166
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,604
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:04,588
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,963
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:28:09,164 --> 00:28:14,924
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,721
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:28:19,922 --> 00:28:23,487
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:29,245
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:34,409
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,948
how to make others feel it.

285
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,636
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,886
or something nonsensical.

287
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:46,863
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:52,988
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:59,027
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:28:59,228 --> 00:29:03,308
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,855
You're sure about this Power

292
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:10,238
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:13,379
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,754
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:25,568
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:35,099
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,537
She tells you the truth.

298
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:45,574
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:50,410
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:54,379
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,801
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,356
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,270
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,145
that you forgive that person,

305
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:12,935
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,951
you don't do anything.

307
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:17,639
That's the truth.

308
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,381
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:26,045
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:30:26,246 --> 00:30:29,928
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,264
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:38,100
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:43,014
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:46,389
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,522
It makes no difference.

316
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,585
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:56,827
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:30:57,028 --> 00:31:01,257
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:06,070
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:09,672
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:13,289
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,312
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:21,218
So it's a play going on.

324
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,679
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:36,622
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:31:36,823 --> 00:31:42,138
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:46,802
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:50,911
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:58,647
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:07,486
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:10,614
When you have the enlightened faith

332
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:17,348
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:23,384
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:28,707
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:34,587
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:32:34,971 --> 00:32:38,364
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:46,450
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:49,997
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:32:50,198 --> 00:32:53,763
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:32:53,964 --> 00:33:01,378
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:07,565
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,620
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:14,542
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:20,284
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:24,589
this work could not have been done.

346
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:29,847
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:41,949
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,012
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:33:46,213 --> 00:33:49,785
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:57,971
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:02,495
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:10,327
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:13,555
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:34:13,756 --> 00:34:18,086
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:21,609
all of them are just the same.

356
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:30,970
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:35,057
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:38,705
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:34:38,906 --> 00:34:43,799
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,846
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:54,612
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:34:54,813 --> 00:35:01,784
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:07,307
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:12,539
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:19,648
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:24,511
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:35:24,712 --> 00:35:28,528
and we have crossed the number what ...(indistinct)... had said,

368
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:31,338
or we can say what St. John has said,

369
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:34,385
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:36,130
It doesn't matter.

371
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:44,009
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,181
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:53,197
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:58,611
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:02,814
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:05,791
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:10,056
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:14,212
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,392
should not disturb you much

380
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:21,142
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:36:21,343 --> 00:36:25,197
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:36:25,398 --> 00:36:29,736
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:35,783
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:39,971
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:43,549
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,776
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:50,698
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:54,768
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:59,206
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,144
That's human nature also.

391
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,980
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,714
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:12,495
So some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:17,150
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:19,298
It will all work out.

396
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:23,712
 It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:31,080
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,908
of this compassion?".

399
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:39,431
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,165
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:46,392
This compassion within you,

402
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:50,173
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:53,650
completely destroyed,

404
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:57,658
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:02,111
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:06,642
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:15,019
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:17,928
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,910
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:27,741
As you see, I would say,

411
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:33,241
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:35,796
the water rises.

413
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:42,062
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:46,046
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:50,655
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:53,202
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:59,645
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:06,523
So at this juncture when we are all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:09,234
you all have got your realization

420
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:13,836
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:17,438
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:21,620
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthies,

423
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,667
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:31,253
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:35,621
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:37,900
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:40,618
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:45,215
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,598
That's what we have to understand

430
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:57,948
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,432
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:05,901
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:11,862
I should say,

434
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:17,729
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,979
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,221
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:32,385
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:40:32,586 --> 00:40:37,455
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:40,963
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:50,300
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:53,534
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:57,050
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:02,902
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:09,418
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,098
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:16,864
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:23,356
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:28,653
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:33,770
So you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:37,965
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,098
I think, from Africa.

452
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:44,621
So I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:48,023
Also we have so many other areas

454
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:51,453
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:58,312
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:00,854
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:04,760
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:07,682
who are not even seeking.

459
00:42:07,883 --> 00:42:13,026
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:18,456
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:23,325
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:42:23,526 --> 00:42:27,567
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:32,403
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:37,856
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:44,067
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:49,239
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,145
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:42:53,346 --> 00:42:56,786
because many people have seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:58,872
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:04,778
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:07,833
This you will not do.

472
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:15,067
You are the, really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:43:15,268 --> 00:43:21,497
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:27,935
and this salt is going to dissolve many others

475
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:32,201
once we start spreading out like that.

476
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,279
I am not saying you should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,506
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:45,334
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,162
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,264
who don't have greed.

481
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:54,405
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:43:54,606 --> 00:44:00,280
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:03,796
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,598
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:11,223
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:13,856
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:16,286
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:22,356
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:25,708
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,622
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:36,440
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,372
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:44:39,573 --> 00:44:41,966
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:44,560
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:48,370
you will try to have more of it

496
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:53,386
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,490
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:58,435
women should work it out

499
00:44:58,636 --> 00:45:03,998
because women have more sense of compassion -

500
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,545
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:11,747
Normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:45:11,948 --> 00:45:14,833
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:45:15,034 --> 00:45:20,294
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:45:20,495 --> 00:45:24,997
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:45:25,198 --> 00:45:26,958
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:30,833
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:34,036
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:41,059
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,217
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:46,819
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,451
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:55,279
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,615
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:46:01,816 --> 00:46:05,959
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,451
And as you are all married also,

516
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:15,662
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:22,592
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,919
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,005
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:33,044
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:36,690
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:40,440
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:43,674
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:51,558
And if something

525
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:54,050
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:56,433
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:46:56,634 --> 00:47:00,183
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,566
and the household and this and that,"

529
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:07,363
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:10,097
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:13,847
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:17,894
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:22,316
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:27,464
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:33,316
Actually what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:41,685
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:45,826
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,865
You will never grudge.

539
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:54,323
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:47:54,777 --> 00:47:58,560
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:02,068
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:08,177
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:13,216
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:17,786
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:48:17,987 --> 00:48:21,309
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,504
So the compassion has to become active.

547
00:48:24,705 --> 00:48:27,769
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,246
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:35,223
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:48:35,424 --> 00:48:40,192
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:43,450
but some of them have not been because I think

552
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:45,632
some of the women have been men

553
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:50,481
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:48:50,682 --> 00:48:55,059
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:00,981
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:49:01,182 --> 00:49:02,606
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,340
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:08,249
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, can understand,

559
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,249
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,259
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,767
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:23,939
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,432
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:31,393
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,002
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:37,980
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:41,605
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:45,902
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:51,144
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:55,410
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:49:55,611 --> 00:50:00,519
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,011
how it has worked out.

573
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:08,261
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:12,534
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:50:12,735 --> 00:50:17,222
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:22,753
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:24,727
I can't understand

578
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:28,769
the one who has his Kundalini awakened fully,

579
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:35,644
who has felt the All Pervading Power of Love,

580
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:39,644
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:50:39,845 --> 00:50:48,745
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:57,934
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:03,342
It is to realize

584
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:11,798
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:16,035
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:22,574
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:26,043
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:28,926
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,801
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:36,808
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:39,675
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:44,416
and I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:49,887
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere.

594
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:55,989
So at least that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,552
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:04,005
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:07,843
For your own life, is very important

598
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:12,226
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:18,351
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:22,624
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:52:22,825 --> 00:52:26,950
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,397
Just think of it.

603
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:38,920
What you are surrendering is what is perverted,

604
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:45,233
whatever is destructive, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:52,014
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:52:52,215 --> 00:52:57,006
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,998
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:05,240
If you don't know yourself, how will you know God also?

609
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:06,982
Impossible.

610
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:12,255
So to know yourself you have to evolve.

611
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,028
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:18,434
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:25,150
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:53:25,351 --> 00:53:29,177
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:35,716
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,435
You can do it.

617
00:53:37,636 --> 00:53:42,896
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:48,287
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:52,912
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:56,154
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:53:56,355 --> 00:54:03,177
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis, unbelievable,

622
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:08,950
but as it is growing sideways it should also grow upwards.

623
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,207
As it is growing in quantity

624
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:16,113
it should also grow more in quality;

625
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:21,176
and as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:23,489
Because I know all the time

627
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:26,536
you are so collective that you all the time you feel,

628
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:30,013
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:54:30,214 --> 00:54:34,365
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:36,578
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:40,201
"My father still is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,279
So forget about them.

633
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,209
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,568
They are your real relations.

635
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:55,670
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:54:55,871 --> 00:54:59,577
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,811
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:55:03,012 --> 00:55:07,217
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:55:07,418 --> 00:55:11,155
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:55:11,356 --> 00:55:14,061
You should find out where are they.

641
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:16,975
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:55:17,176 --> 00:55:21,959
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,568
Whatever you want,

644
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:28,256
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:33,819
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,038
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:42,772
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:50,139
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,902
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,855
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:04,894
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:09,089
So I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:12,339
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,730
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:17,938
I think if there's any puja that we should do, is this one,

656
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:19,628
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:23,120
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:56:23,321 --> 00:56:29,393
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,557
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:56:32,758 --> 00:56:37,487
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:42,480
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:56:42,681 --> 00:56:45,166
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:49,197
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:56:49,398 --> 00:56:50,641
So you have to worship

665
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:55,000
and is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:58,578
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:02,279
May God bless you.
