1
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:05,547
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:12,887
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,267
We can say this is the worship

4
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:21,357
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:31,287
If you understand that all this,

6
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:38,317
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:45,767
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,897
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:55,107
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:04:55,307 --> 00:05:03,657
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:10,967
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:19,157
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:22,927
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:29,467
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,527
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,947
by the primordial sound,

17
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:40,207
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:45,927
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:50,747
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:58,227
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:05,927
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:12,687
and for His own expression,

23
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:16,207
for His own manifestation,

24
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:20,527
for His own reflection.

25
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:26,427
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:31,527
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:37,197
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:47,207
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:53,717
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:59,197
His desire to create.

31
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,937
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:08,577
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:12,607
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:18,797
The attention has its own joy

35
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:23,607
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:26,967
She created all the universes,

37
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:31,877
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:37,567
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:41,327
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:47,917
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,047
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:57,417
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,827
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:07,737
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:14,217
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,227
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:21,387
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:25,317
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:30,957
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,807
to see His character

51
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:38,777
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:45,377
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:51,207
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:57,637
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:03,537
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:08,597
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:14,657
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:19,397
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:25,217
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:32,407
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:38,347
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:43,187
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:47,587
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,727
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,307
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:59,937
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:04,897
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:08,087
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:10,607
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:14,327
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:20,417
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:26,637
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:36,467
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,517
we do something, we can create.

75
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:47,017
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,597
leave alone anything else.

77
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:54,867
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:10:55,067 --> 00:11:00,567
we can put together and create something,

79
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:10,147
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:15,227
any power.

81
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,467
We cannot create anything.

82
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:26,437
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:32,047
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:35,377
Still it is gold.

85
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,717
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:43,317
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:47,087
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:52,007
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:55,087
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:11:55,287 --> 00:12:01,827
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:05,647
basically you all are the same.

92
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:11,287
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:15,697
also you cry the same way.

94
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:19,567
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:24,427
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:30,557
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:35,417
by some common principle of life.

98
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:41,027
And the common principle of life that is bound us

99
00:12:41,237 --> 00:12:48,077
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,987
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,437
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:57,777
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:07,057
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:13:07,257 --> 00:13:10,537
But in the human form only

105
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:17,677
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:23,267
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:28,767
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:34,917
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:38,477
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:45,977
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:51,157
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:58,287
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:01,437
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:06,447
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:09,617
who have got your realization.

116
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:14,037
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:21,177
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,957
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,847
and the enjoyment.

120
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:36,787
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:40,547
what should happen to you?

122
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:45,197
What should we feel?

123
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:51,487
How do we then exist?

124
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:57,497
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:14:57,857 --> 00:15:01,357
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:02,987
that you are not there,

127
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:07,117
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,287
Secondly what happens to you

129
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:14,207
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:17,167
Just the existence.

131
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,917
And that existence that you become,

132
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:25,477
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:15:25,997 --> 00:15:31,097
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,137
also much before.

135
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,847
In every religion we have had people

136
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:40,517
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:45,867
For example, even you can say,

138
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:53,037
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:15:53,237 --> 00:16:00,107
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,777
and a khumba also,

141
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,857
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:12,657
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:17,467
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:22,607
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:28,177
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:33,817
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,647
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:42,053
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:48,927
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:53,937
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:58,427
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:03,807
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:11,077
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:14,387
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:20,697
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:25,987
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:31,427
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,547
Also it will tell you wherever you go, like,

159
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:39,277
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,847
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:46,427
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:49,037
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:51,197
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:55,587
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:59,827
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,937
I said, 'Now what to do, where to go,

167
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:04,027
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:06,597
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:18:06,797 --> 00:18:09,167
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:14,417
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:20,327
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:24,357
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,467
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:31,137
So the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:34,247
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,617
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:43,947
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:49,967
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:52,717
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:57,217
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,517
and we have to respect it.

182
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:01,807
I've already told you many a times

183
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,897
about how human beings were formed

184
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:12,047
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,307
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:18,747
All this leads us to understand

187
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:23,597
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:30,147
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:33,057
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:37,197
where you have become yourself.

191
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,547
You know yourself.

192
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:43,797
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:51,307
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:19:53,677 --> 00:20:00,427
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:35,307
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:42,627
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:52,507
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:58,997
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:02,927
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:06,627
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:14,607
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:24,397
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:29,327
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:35,457
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:39,997
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:44,707
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:48,827
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:53,647
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:58,607
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:02,697
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:06,557
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:11,047
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,717
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:20,097
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:28,037
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:31,487
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:22:31,687 --> 00:22:40,037
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:47,797
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:53,757
that It is the One that has given you intelligence;

220
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:57,927
It is the One that has given you wisdom;

221
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,097
It is the One which has given you

222
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,277
whatever you have as you were singing that,

223
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:08,827
"Whatever we have is given by You."

224
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:13,537
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:18,187
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,087
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:27,047
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:23:27,297 --> 00:23:34,917
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:43,887
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:48,497
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:55,227
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:59,287
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:05,157
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:08,797
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,847
It's such a relationship.

236
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:15,177
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:20,637
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:27,737
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:39,167
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:44,587
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:50,127
and over your development.

242
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:58,177
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:02,797
Now

244
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:13,527
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:16,457
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,057
you may.

247
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,197
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:25:20,397 --> 00:25:23,497
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:26,967
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:33,397
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:37,527
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,317
because it has a reaction.

253
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:49,537
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:25:49,767 --> 00:26:05,637
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:11,537
into the water automatically,

256
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:19,477
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:24,517
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,907
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:33,197
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:26:33,697 --> 00:26:43,567
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:50,167
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:57,347
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:26:57,977 --> 00:27:03,327
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:07,367
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:12,087
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:18,587
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:22,697
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:27,347
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,787
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:34,507
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,447
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:41,637
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:44,737
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:51,607
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:57,167
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,607
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:04,587
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:08,967
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:14,927
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:19,727
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:23,487
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:29,247
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:34,407
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:36,947
how to make others feel it.

285
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:40,637
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:42,887
or something nonsensical.

287
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:46,867
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:52,987
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:59,027
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:03,307
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:05,857
You're sure about this Power

292
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:10,237
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:13,377
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:19,757
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:25,567
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:35,097
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,537
She tells you the truth.

298
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:45,577
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:50,417
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:54,377
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:29:54,587 --> 00:29:59,807
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,357
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,277
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:08,147
that you forgive that person,

305
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:12,937
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:15,957
you don't do anything.

307
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:17,637
That's the truth.

308
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:22,387
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,047
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:29,927
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:33,267
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:38,107
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:43,017
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:46,387
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,527
It makes no difference.

316
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:52,587
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:56,827
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:30:57,027 --> 00:31:01,257
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:06,077
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:31:06,277 --> 00:31:09,677
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:13,287
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:18,317
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:21,217
So it's a play going on.

324
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:27,677
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:36,627
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:42,137
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:46,807
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,917
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:58,647
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:07,487
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,617
When you have the enlightened faith

332
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:17,347
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:23,387
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:28,707
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:34,587
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:38,367
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:46,457
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:49,997
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:53,767
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:32:53,967 --> 00:33:01,377
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:07,567
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:10,627
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:14,547
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:20,287
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:24,587
this work could not have been done.

346
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:29,847
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:41,947
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:46,017
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:49,787
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:57,977
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:33:58,177 --> 00:34:02,497
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:10,327
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:13,557
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:18,087
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:21,607
all of them are just the same.

356
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:30,977
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:35,057
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:38,707
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:43,797
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:49,847
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:54,617
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:34:54,817 --> 00:35:01,787
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:07,307
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:12,537
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:19,647
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:24,517
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:28,527
and we have crossed the number what we call,

368
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,337
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:34,387
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,137
It doesn't matter.

371
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:44,007
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:48,187
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:53,197
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:58,617
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:02,817
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:05,797
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,057
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:14,217
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:16,397
should not disturb you much

380
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:21,147
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:25,197
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:29,737
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:35,787
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:39,977
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:43,547
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:46,777
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:50,697
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:54,767
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:59,207
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,147
That's human nature also.

391
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:04,987
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:08,717
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:12,497
So some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:17,157
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:19,297
It will all work out.

396
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:23,717
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:31,087
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:33,907
of this compassion?".

399
00:37:34,107 --> 00:37:39,437
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:43,167
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:46,397
This compassion within you,

402
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,177
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:53,657
completely destroyed,

404
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:57,657
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:02,117
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:38:02,317 --> 00:38:06,647
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:15,017
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:17,927
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:22,917
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:38:24,797 --> 00:38:27,747
As you see, I would say,

411
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:33,247
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,797
the water rises.

413
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:42,067
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:46,047
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:50,657
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:53,207
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:59,647
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:06,527
So at this juncture when we are all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:09,237
you all have got your realization

420
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:13,837
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:17,437
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:21,627
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:25,667
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:31,257
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:35,627
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:37,907
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:39:38,107 --> 00:39:40,617
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:45,217
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:48,597
That's what we have to understand

430
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:57,947
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,437
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:05,907
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:11,867
I should say,

434
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:17,727
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,977
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:26,227
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:40:26,427 --> 00:40:32,387
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:37,457
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:40:37,657 --> 00:40:40,967
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:50,307
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:53,537
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:57,057
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:40:57,257 --> 00:41:02,907
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:09,417
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:12,097
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:16,867
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:23,357
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:28,657
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:33,777
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:37,967
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,097
I think, from Africa.

452
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:44,627
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:48,027
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:51,457
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:58,317
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,857
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:42:01,057 --> 00:42:04,767
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:07,687
who are not even seeking.

459
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:13,027
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:18,457
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:42:18,657 --> 00:42:23,327
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:27,567
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:32,407
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:37,857
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:44,067
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:42:44,267 --> 00:42:49,237
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:53,147
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:56,787
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:58,877
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:04,777
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,837
This you will not do.

472
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:15,067
You are the, really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:21,497
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:43:21,697 --> 00:43:27,937
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:32,207
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:35,277
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,507
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:43:38,707 --> 00:43:45,337
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:49,167
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:43:49,367 --> 00:43:51,267
who don't have greed.

481
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:54,407
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:43:54,607 --> 00:44:00,287
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:03,797
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:44:04,027 --> 00:44:07,597
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:11,227
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,857
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:44:14,057 --> 00:44:16,287
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:22,357
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:25,707
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:29,627
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:44:29,827 --> 00:44:36,447
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:39,377
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:41,967
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:44,567
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:48,377
you will try to have more of it

496
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:53,387
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,497
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,437
women should work it out

499
00:44:58,637 --> 00:45:03,997
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:08,547
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,747
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:45:11,947 --> 00:45:14,837
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:20,297
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:45:20,497 --> 00:45:24,997
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:26,957
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:30,837
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:34,037
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:41,057
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:45:41,267 --> 00:45:43,217
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:46,817
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:50,457
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:55,277
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:45:55,487 --> 00:46:01,617
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:46:01,817 --> 00:46:05,957
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:10,457
And as you are all married also,

516
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:15,667
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:22,597
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:46:22,797 --> 00:46:24,917
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:29,007
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:33,047
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:36,697
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:40,447
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:43,677
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:51,557
And if something

525
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:54,057
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:56,437
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:46:56,637 --> 00:47:00,187
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:03,567
and the household and this and that,"

529
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:07,367
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,097
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:47:10,297 --> 00:47:13,847
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:47:14,047 --> 00:47:17,897
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:47:18,097 --> 00:47:22,317
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:27,467
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:33,317
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:41,687
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:45,827
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:48,867
You will never grudge.

539
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:54,327
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:47:54,777 --> 00:47:58,567
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:02,067
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:08,177
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:48:08,377 --> 00:48:13,217
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:48:13,417 --> 00:48:17,787
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:48:17,987 --> 00:48:21,307
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:24,507
So the compassion has to become active.

547
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:27,767
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:30,247
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:48:30,447 --> 00:48:35,227
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:40,197
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:43,457
but some of them have not been because I think

552
00:48:43,657 --> 00:48:45,637
some of the women have been men

553
00:48:45,837 --> 00:48:50,487
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,057
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:48:55,267 --> 00:49:00,987
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,607
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,347
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:08,247
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:10,247
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:13,257
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:17,767
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:23,937
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:49:24,147 --> 00:49:26,437
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:49:26,637 --> 00:49:31,397
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:49:31,597 --> 00:49:34,007
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,987
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:41,607
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:49:41,807 --> 00:49:45,907
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:51,147
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:55,417
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:49:55,617 --> 00:50:00,517
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:04,017
how it has worked out.

573
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:08,267
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:12,537
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:17,227
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:22,757
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:50:22,957 --> 00:50:24,727
I can't understand

578
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:28,767
the one who has his Kundalini awakened fully,

579
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:35,647
who has felt the All Pervading Power of Love,

580
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:39,647
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:48,747
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:57,937
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:03,347
It is to realize

584
00:51:03,547 --> 00:51:11,797
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:51:12,097 --> 00:51:16,037
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:51:16,237 --> 00:51:22,577
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:51:22,777 --> 00:51:26,047
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:51:26,247 --> 00:51:28,927
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,807
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,807
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,677
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:44,417
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:49,887
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:55,987
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,557
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:51:58,757 --> 00:52:04,007
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:07,847
For your own life, is very important

598
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:12,227
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:18,357
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:52:18,557 --> 00:52:22,627
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:26,957
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:31,397
Just think of it.

603
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:38,927
What you are surrendering is what is perverted,

604
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:45,237
whatever is destructive, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:52,017
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:57,007
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,997
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:53:02,197 --> 00:53:05,247
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:06,987
Impossible.

610
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:12,257
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:15,027
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:53:15,227 --> 00:53:18,437
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:53:18,637 --> 00:53:25,157
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:53:25,357 --> 00:53:29,177
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:53:29,377 --> 00:53:35,717
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,437
You can do it.

617
00:53:37,637 --> 00:53:42,897
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:48,287
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:52,917
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:53:53,117 --> 00:53:56,157
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:53:56,357 --> 00:54:03,177
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:08,957
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:54:09,157 --> 00:54:12,207
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:16,117
it should also grow more in quality;

625
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:21,177
and as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:23,487
Because I know all the time

627
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:26,537
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:30,017
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:54:30,217 --> 00:54:34,367
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,577
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:40,207
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:42,277
So forget about them.

633
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:49,207
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,567
They are your real relations.

635
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:55,677
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:59,577
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:02,817
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:07,217
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:11,157
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:14,067
You should find out where are they.

641
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:16,977
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:21,957
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,567
Whatever you want,

644
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:28,257
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:33,817
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:37,037
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:42,777
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:50,137
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:56,907
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:55:57,627 --> 00:56:00,857
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:04,897
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:56:05,097 --> 00:56:09,087
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:12,337
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:14,737
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:17,937
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:56:18,137 --> 00:56:19,627
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:23,127
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:29,397
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:32,557
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:37,487
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:42,487
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:45,167
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:49,197
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:50,647
So, you have to worship.

665
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:55,007
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:58,577
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:02,277
May God bless you.
