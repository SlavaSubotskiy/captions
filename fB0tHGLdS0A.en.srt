1
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:05,446
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:12,786
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,166
We can say this is the worship

4
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:21,256
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:31,186
If you understand that all this,

6
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:38,216
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:45,666
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:49,796
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:55,006
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:04:55,206 --> 00:05:03,556
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:10,866
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:19,056
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:22,826
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:29,366
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:33,426
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,846
by the primordial sound,

17
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:40,106
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:45,826
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:50,646
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:05:50,846 --> 00:05:58,126
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:05,826
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:12,586
and for His own expression,

23
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:16,106
for His own manifestation,

24
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:20,426
for His own reflection.

25
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:26,326
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:31,426
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:37,096
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:47,106
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:53,616
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:59,096
His desire to create.

31
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:03,836
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:08,476
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:12,506
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:18,696
The attention has its own joy

35
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,506
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:26,866
She created all the universes,

37
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:31,776
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:37,466
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:41,226
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:47,816
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:51,946
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:57,316
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,726
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:07,636
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:14,116
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:17,126
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:21,286
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:25,216
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:30,856
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,706
to see His character

51
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:38,676
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:45,276
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:51,106
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:57,536
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:03,436
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:08,496
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:14,556
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:19,296
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:25,116
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:32,306
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:38,246
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:43,086
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:47,486
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:51,626
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,206
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:59,836
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:04,796
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,986
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,506
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:14,226
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:20,316
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:26,536
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:36,366
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:40,416
we do something, we can create.

75
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:46,916
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:49,496
leave alone anything else.

77
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:54,766
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:10:54,966 --> 00:11:00,466
we can put together and create something,

79
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:10,046
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:15,126
any power.

81
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,366
We cannot create anything.

82
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:26,336
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:31,946
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,276
Still it is gold.

85
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:38,616
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:43,216
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,986
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:51,906
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:54,986
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:11:55,186 --> 00:12:01,726
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:05,546
basically you all are the same.

92
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:11,186
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:15,596
also, you cry the same way.

94
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,466
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:24,326
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,456
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:35,316
by some common principle of life.

98
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:40,926
And the common principle of life that has bound us

99
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:47,976
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:50,886
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,336
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:57,676
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:06,956
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:10,436
But in the human form only

105
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:17,576
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:23,166
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:28,666
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:34,816
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:38,376
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:45,876
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:51,056
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:58,186
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:01,336
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:06,346
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:09,516
who have got your realization.

116
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:13,936
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:21,076
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:24,856
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,746
and the enjoyment.

120
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:36,686
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:40,446
what should happen to you?

122
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:45,096
What should we feel?

123
00:14:45,296 --> 00:14:51,386
How do we then exist?

124
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:57,396
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:01,256
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:02,886
that you are not there,

127
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:07,016
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:09,186
Secondly, what happens to you

129
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:14,106
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,066
Just the existence.

131
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,816
And that existence that you become,

132
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:25,376
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:30,996
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,036
also much before.

135
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:35,746
In every religion we have had people

136
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:40,416
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:45,766
For example, even you can say,

138
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:52,936
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:15:53,136 --> 00:16:00,006
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,676
and a khumba also,

141
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,756
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:12,556
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:16:12,756 --> 00:16:17,366
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:22,506
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:28,076
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:33,716
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,546
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:41,952
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:16:42,366 --> 00:16:48,826
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:53,836
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:58,326
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:03,706
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:10,976
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:14,286
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:20,596
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:25,886
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:31,326
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:34,446
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

159
00:17:34,646 --> 00:17:39,176
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:42,746
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:46,326
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,936
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,096
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:55,486
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:59,726
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,836
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

167
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:03,926
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,496
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:09,066
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:14,316
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:18:14,516 --> 00:18:20,226
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:24,256
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:28,366
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:31,036
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,146
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,516
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:43,846
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:49,866
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,616
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:57,116
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,416
and we have to respect it.

182
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:01,706
I've already told you many a times

183
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,796
about how human beings were formed

184
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:11,946
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:19:12,146 --> 00:19:15,206
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:18,646
All this leads us to understand

187
00:19:18,846 --> 00:19:23,496
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:30,046
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:32,956
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:37,096
where you have become yourself.

191
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:39,446
You know yourself.

192
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:43,696
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:51,206
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:19:53,576 --> 00:20:00,326
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:35,206
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:42,526
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:52,406
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:58,896
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:02,826
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:06,526
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:14,506
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:24,296
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:29,226
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:35,356
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:39,896
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:44,606
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:48,726
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:53,546
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:58,506
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:02,596
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:06,456
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:10,946
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:16,616
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:22:16,816 --> 00:22:19,996
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:27,936
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,386
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:39,936
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:47,696
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:53,656
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

220
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:57,826
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

221
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,996
It is the One which has given you

222
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:04,176
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

223
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:08,726
"Whatever we have is given by You".

224
00:23:09,046 --> 00:23:13,436
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:18,086
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:21,986
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:26,946
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:34,816
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:43,786
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,396
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:55,126
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:59,186
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:05,056
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:08,696
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:11,746
It's such a relationship.

236
00:24:11,946 --> 00:24:15,076
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:20,536
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:27,636
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:39,066
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:44,486
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:50,026
and over your development.

242
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:58,076
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:24:58,936 --> 00:25:02,696
Now

244
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:13,426
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:16,356
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,956
you may.

247
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,096
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:23,396
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:25:23,596 --> 00:25:26,866
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:33,296
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:37,426
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,216
because it has a reaction.

253
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:49,436
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:25:49,666 --> 00:26:05,536
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:11,436
into the water automatically,

256
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:19,376
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:24,416
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,806
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:33,096
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:43,466
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:50,066
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:57,246
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:03,226
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:07,266
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:11,986
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:18,486
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:22,596
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:27,246
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,686
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:34,406
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,346
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:41,536
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:44,636
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:51,506
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:57,066
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,506
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:04,486
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:08,866
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:14,826
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,626
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:23,386
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:29,146
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:34,306
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,846
how to make others feel it.

285
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:40,536
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:42,786
or something nonsensical.

287
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:46,766
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:52,886
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:28:53,086 --> 00:28:58,926
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:03,206
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,756
You're sure about this Power

292
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:10,136
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:13,276
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:19,656
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:25,466
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:34,996
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,436
She tells you the truth.

298
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:45,476
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:50,316
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:54,276
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:59,706
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,256
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:05,176
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:08,046
that you forgive that person,

305
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:12,836
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:15,856
you don't do anything.

307
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,536
That's the truth.

308
00:30:17,746 --> 00:30:22,286
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:25,946
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:29,826
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:33,166
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:38,006
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:42,916
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:46,286
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:49,426
It makes no difference.

316
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:52,486
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:56,726
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:30:56,926 --> 00:31:01,156
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:05,976
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:09,576
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:13,186
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:18,216
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,116
So, it's a play going on.

324
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:27,576
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:36,526
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:42,036
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:46,706
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:50,816
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:58,546
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:07,386
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:10,516
When you have the enlightened faith,

332
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:17,246
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:23,286
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:28,606
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:34,486
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:38,266
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:46,356
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:49,896
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:53,666
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:32:53,866 --> 00:33:01,276
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:07,466
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,526
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:14,446
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:20,186
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:24,486
this work could not have been done.

346
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:29,746
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:41,846
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:45,916
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:49,686
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:57,876
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:02,396
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:10,226
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:13,456
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:34:13,656 --> 00:34:17,986
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:21,506
all of them are just the same.

356
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:30,876
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:34,956
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,606
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:43,696
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:49,746
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:54,516
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:34:54,716 --> 00:35:01,686
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:07,206
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:12,436
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:19,546
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:24,416
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:28,426
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

368
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,236
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:35:31,436 --> 00:35:34,286
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,036
It doesn't matter.

371
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:43,906
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:48,086
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:53,096
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:58,516
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:35:58,716 --> 00:36:02,716
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,696
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:09,956
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:14,116
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:16,296
should not disturb you much

380
00:36:16,496 --> 00:36:21,046
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:25,096
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:29,636
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:35,686
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:39,876
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:43,446
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:46,676
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:36:46,876 --> 00:36:50,596
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:54,666
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:36:54,866 --> 00:36:59,106
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:01,046
That's human nature also.

391
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:04,886
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:08,616
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:12,396
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:17,056
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,196
It will all work out.

396
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:23,616
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:30,986
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:33,806
of this compassion?".

399
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:39,336
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:43,066
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:37:43,266 --> 00:37:46,296
This compassion within you,

402
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:50,076
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,556
completely destroyed,

404
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:57,556
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:37:57,756 --> 00:38:02,016
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:06,546
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:38:06,746 --> 00:38:14,916
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,826
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:22,816
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:27,646
As you see, I would say,

411
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:33,146
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,696
the water rises.

413
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:41,966
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:45,946
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:50,556
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:53,106
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:59,546
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:06,426
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:09,136
you all have got your Realization

420
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:13,736
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:17,336
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:21,526
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:25,566
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:31,156
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:39:31,356 --> 00:39:35,526
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:37,806
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:40,516
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:45,116
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,496
That's what we have to understand

430
00:39:48,726 --> 00:39:57,846
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,336
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:05,806
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:11,766
I should say,

434
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:17,626
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:20,876
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:26,126
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:32,286
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:40:32,486 --> 00:40:37,356
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:40,866
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:50,206
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,436
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:56,956
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:40:57,156 --> 00:41:02,806
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:41:03,006 --> 00:41:09,316
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:41:09,516 --> 00:41:11,996
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:16,766
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:23,256
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,556
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:33,676
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:37,866
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:39,996
I think, from Africa.

452
00:41:40,196 --> 00:41:44,526
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:41:44,726 --> 00:41:47,926
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:51,356
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:58,216
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,756
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:04,666
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:07,586
who are not even seeking.

459
00:42:07,786 --> 00:42:12,926
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:18,356
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:23,226
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:42:23,426 --> 00:42:27,466
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:32,306
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:37,756
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:43,966
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:49,136
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:53,046
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:56,686
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,776
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:04,676
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:43:04,876 --> 00:43:07,736
This you will not do.

472
00:43:07,936 --> 00:43:14,966
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:21,396
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:27,836
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:32,106
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:35,176
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:38,406
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:43:38,606 --> 00:43:45,236
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:49,066
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:51,166
who don't have greed.

481
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:54,306
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:43:54,506 --> 00:44:00,186
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:03,696
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:44:03,926 --> 00:44:07,496
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:11,126
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:44:11,326 --> 00:44:13,756
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:16,186
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:22,256
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:44:22,456 --> 00:44:25,606
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:29,526
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:36,346
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:39,276
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,866
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,466
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:48,276
you will try to have more of it

496
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:53,286
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:56,396
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,336
women should work it out

499
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:03,896
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:08,446
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:11,646
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:14,736
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:20,196
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:24,896
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:26,856
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:45:27,056 --> 00:45:30,736
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,936
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:40,956
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,116
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:46,716
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:50,356
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:55,176
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:45:55,386 --> 00:46:01,516
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:05,856
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:10,356
And as you are all married also,

516
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:15,566
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:22,496
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,816
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:28,906
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:32,946
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:46:33,146 --> 00:46:36,596
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:40,346
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:43,576
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:46:43,776 --> 00:46:51,456
And if something

525
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:53,956
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:56,336
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:46:56,536 --> 00:47:00,086
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:47:00,286 --> 00:47:03,466
and the household and this and that".

529
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:07,266
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:09,996
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:13,746
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:47:13,946 --> 00:47:17,796
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:22,216
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:27,366
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:33,216
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:41,586
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:45,726
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:48,766
You will never grudge.

539
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:54,226
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:58,466
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:01,966
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:08,076
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:13,116
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:17,686
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:48:17,886 --> 00:48:21,206
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,406
So, the compassion has to become active.

547
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:27,666
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:30,146
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:35,126
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:40,096
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:43,356
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

552
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:45,536
some of the women have been men

553
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:50,386
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:54,956
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:48:55,166 --> 00:49:00,886
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:02,506
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,246
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:08,146
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:10,146
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:13,156
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:17,666
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:49:17,866 --> 00:49:23,836
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:26,336
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:31,296
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:33,906
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:37,886
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:41,506
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:49:41,706 --> 00:49:45,806
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:51,046
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:49:51,246 --> 00:49:55,316
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:49:55,516 --> 00:50:00,416
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:03,916
how it has worked out.

573
00:50:04,116 --> 00:50:08,166
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:12,436
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:17,126
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:22,656
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:24,626
I can't understand

578
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:28,666
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

579
00:50:28,876 --> 00:50:35,546
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

580
00:50:35,746 --> 00:50:39,546
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:48,646
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:57,836
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:03,246
It is to realize

584
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:11,696
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:15,936
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:22,476
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:51:22,676 --> 00:51:25,946
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,826
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:32,706
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,706
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:51:36,906 --> 00:51:39,576
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:44,316
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:51:44,516 --> 00:51:49,786
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:55,886
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,456
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:51:58,656 --> 00:52:03,906
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:07,746
For your own life, is very important

598
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:12,126
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:52:12,326 --> 00:52:18,256
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:52:18,456 --> 00:52:22,526
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:26,856
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:31,296
Just think of it.

603
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:38,826
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

604
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:45,136
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:51,916
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:56,906
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:52:57,106 --> 00:53:01,896
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,146
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:06,886
Impossible.

610
00:53:07,086 --> 00:53:12,156
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,926
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:18,336
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:25,056
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:29,076
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:35,616
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:37,336
You can do it.

617
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:42,796
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:48,186
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:53:48,386 --> 00:53:52,816
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:56,056
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:53:56,256 --> 00:54:03,076
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:54:03,276 --> 00:54:08,856
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:54:09,056 --> 00:54:12,106
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:54:12,306 --> 00:54:16,016
it should also grow in quality.

625
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:21,076
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:23,386
Because I know all the time

627
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:26,436
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:54:26,636 --> 00:54:29,916
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:54:30,116 --> 00:54:34,266
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:36,476
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:40,106
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:54:40,306 --> 00:54:42,176
So forget about them.

633
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:49,106
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:51,466
They are your real relations.

635
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:55,576
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:54:55,776 --> 00:54:59,476
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:02,716
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:07,116
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:55:07,316 --> 00:55:11,056
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:13,966
You should find out where are they.

641
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,876
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:55:17,076 --> 00:55:21,856
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:23,466
Whatever you want,

644
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:28,156
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:33,716
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:36,936
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:55:37,136 --> 00:55:42,676
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:50,036
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:56,806
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:55:57,526 --> 00:56:00,756
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:04,796
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:08,986
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:56:09,196 --> 00:56:12,236
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:14,636
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:56:14,836 --> 00:56:17,836
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:19,526
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:56:19,726 --> 00:56:23,026
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:29,296
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:32,456
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:37,386
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:56:37,586 --> 00:56:42,386
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:45,066
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:49,096
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:56:49,296 --> 00:56:50,546
So, you have to worship.

665
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:54,906
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:58,476
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:02,176
May God bless you.
