1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,630
What a beautiful place to come to! As such
/ Which[Sounds like as such…] I have been

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:08,630
here before also. You have such nice places
on the outskirts. On the outskirts you have

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
really very nice places in Sydney and this
picnicking has helped you to make your collectivity

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,289
better. That’s how they started having picnics
and in the picnics they develop the collectivity,

5
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:38,289
which is very beautiful to be one with the
nature, see the bounty of the nature and the

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,840
variety that they have.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Is a innate feeling inside always that you
should be one with the nature, that you should

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,120
enjoy the nature. I mean it’s maybe because
they say we have evolved from animals so we

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,640
like nature. But it’s so much …xxxx………
[Cannot hear the word…] so much your temperament,

10
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:33,500
everything when you see the nature and start
seeing it, how it obeys the laws which govern

11
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,850
it. Now see, if you see every leaf, any leaf,
is not comparable with another leaf, if you

12
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,909
put it under microscope they’ ll be all
different leaves.

13
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:58,909
The variety’s so much in the nature, but
still how they abide together and the greatest

14
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:09,049
thing they have is that always the desire
to get the sunlight and every leaf, every

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,760
branch tries to give chance to another leaf
and another branch, that they all get the

16
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,150
sunlight. If you have to see collectivity,
really you see in a jungle or in a place like

17
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:35,290
this. How they live together and with such
happiness, with such unity. They are all under

18
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:51,349
the complete control of the divine laws, no
doubt, and they are so much enjoying.

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It’s only the human beings who have got
this freedom, the will, “free will” as

20
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,950
they call it. If you want to go to heaven,
you can go to heaven. If you want, you can

21
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,950
go to hell. And that is what we are facing
now in modern times, that if we do not take

22
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:36,050
course to sensible things we may be all wiped
out of the surface of the Earth. I’ve been

23
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,760
telling since long that it affects our genes.
Supposing a father is an alcoholic, the son

24
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:00,769
also gets it in his genes. So many things,
most of the vulnerability that you have or

25
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,400
what you can call the susceptibly 
is coming from these genes. And the susceptibility
to do something wrong, always to take to something

26
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:27,339
bad, whatever is destructive, comes from the
gene and it was said that the Asians have

27
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:41,069
two genes which protects them, bars them for
doing something wrong. Might be a culture

28
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,550
research, I don’t know. And the Aboriginals
and the people who have lived in the nature

29
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,129
have only one gene that protects. But for
white skin, there’s no gene to protect.

30
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:11,129
Can you imagine? They’re left to winds.
Whichever way the wind blows, they start blowing.

31
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:20,589
So, it’s such a big problem with the white
skin — also they think they are the higher

32
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,930
race, but they’re not according to the biological
process, you can say. You can see the Germans,

33
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,930
what they did. I mean, killing children in
the gas. How could they do it? I mean, I just

34
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,050
— unimaginable. The way they have killed
people in all the African countries also,

35
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,400
specially in America, the Spanish. Unimaginable.
The way they have treated other people everywhere.

36
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:06,259
Cruelty comes to them first. Very easily they
can become cruel. They take to bad things

37
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:18,289
very easily. There are some Sahaja Yogis who
came to Sahaja Yoga, stayed in Sahaja Yoga

38
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:25,289
for so much and again they have taken to their
bad life.

39
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:33,039
So now it is very much to be understood that
you have to be very careful and cautious.

40
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,879
The bhoots will first catch you. That’s
why so much schizophrenia everywhere. If you

41
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:50,879
— schizophrenia is so much true in America.
So much. All kinds of horrible diseases they

42
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:59,139
have. I can’t understand how they got it.

43
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:06,139
So one has to be very careful that after coming
to Sahaja Yoga you must stick on to your sublime

44
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:16,089
Self, to your glorious Self, otherwise it
is dangerous. When one thing about Sahaja

45
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Yoga I was amazed that how it cleanses the
gene. Actually, gene in a Persian language

46
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:36,889
is called like a “bhoot,” you know Jin,
but this whole theory is now showing that

47
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:54,849
white- skinned people are more vulnerable
to all kinds of things and I think they are

48
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:05,110
the ones who have suffered a lot because there
must have been a big fight within, that ‘What

49
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,110
is this nonsense we are doing? Why should
we do it?’ And that’s why so many of them

50
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:22,459
started seeking, so many of them. The seeking
is so much suggested in Indian culture, everything,

51
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,520
but no body did that the way that you people
were seeking is creditable; because you realized,

52
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,470
perhaps, that this is a terrible life you
are into. ‘Why are we here, so unprotected?’

53
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,470
and that’s why so much of — we have so
many Sahaja Yogis all over the world who have

54
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:56,890
taken to Sahaja Yoga and are steady themselves
and are progressing beautifully. That means

55
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:08,580
the genes which we are not protecting have
become protective, one thing, and those genes

56
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,650
which make you vulnerable to things also become
clean and you cannot get to those things.

57
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,420
They said the people who get AIDS are the
ones who have genes like that. They’re vulnerable

58
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,440
to AIDS.

59
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,440
So, this new dimension that science has exposed
before us tells us two things, that by living

60
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:53,190
like a white country, people saw the hell
itself and that’s why they have taken now,

61
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,640
with such a big jump, to Sahaja Yoga and your
duty is to see that you get more out of all

62
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,660
that hell. Around you, if you see — I mean,
when you read the newspaper you’re shocked.

63
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:26,660
It’s not the accident by which people die,
but all kinds of diseases, murders, this,

64
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,720
that going on. God knows, such violence. Specially
in America, you’ll be surprised that I can’t

65
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:40,630
even wear my wedding ring there. My husband
doesn’t allow Me to wear My wedding ring,

66
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:47,630
even mangal sutra. And what goes wrong with
them, I don’t know, that they take to violence

67
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,800
without any difficulties.

68
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,490
We had one gentleman who came from America.
He had already murdered his brother and murdered

69
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,490
his mother also — mother and brother, both.
I said , “How could you do that?” And

70
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,400
so many you will find in England who have
killed their children and the children, when

71
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,230
you see them, nothing but — you develop
a kind of a special sweet feeling, isn’t

72
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,620
it — very sweet. It’s a in Sanskrit called
as “Vatsalya.” In our all Indian languages

73
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,620
we use that word, Vatsalaya, when the feeling
that you get when you see a little child.

74
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,330
They have described Shri Krishna as a little
child. They have described Shri Rama as a

75
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:51,330
little child. Also Christ as a little child
has been described in the Indian churches.

76
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Beautiful, very beautifully He has been described.
One song, one poem was there, written very

77
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,480
beautifully that Christ as a child, who can
turn the whole universe with His own finger,

78
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,930
was putting His own finger in the mouth as
a child. Such beautiful poetry is written

79
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,870
about children, how they behave, but not so
much in the English language, Spanish language.

80
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,870
They go more for this love affairs and things
like that. But what about children? They never

81
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:45,050
describe children, how beautiful they are.
I think I have read hardly about ten or twelve

82
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,940
poems. One of them I remember is “The Toys.”
There’s such [Low and muffled], Poet says

83
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:04,130
that he got very angry with his child and
he beat him and the child was crying and then

84
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:12,730
the child went off to sleep with the little
doll maybe or something and when he saw him

85
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,940
sleeping like that he says to God that maybe
I might do lots of mistakes and you might

86
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,820
punish me, but when I’m dying, then you
must forgive me as I have forgiven my son.

87
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:38,930
That is a very beautiful song was written
by him. But still, the description of a child,

88
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:45,930
how when he runs when he runs, when he jumps,
when he walks it’s a beautiful songs about

89
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,810
Shri Rama. Thumko atta hai who – Thumakat
chalat Ram Chandra, atta hai kya? [Mother

90
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,250
says in Hindi “Do you know the song Thumakat
chalat Ram Chandra...”]

91
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:07,320
Now these words are such that we cannot explain
in English, but when they walk, you know,

92
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,480
with — started walking, so their body, you
know, moves in a way that’s called “Thumakna”

93
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,480
in Hindi language. So described by Tulsidasa,
as Shri Rama is walking in that way. Thumakat

94
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:29,150
chalat Ram Chandra. And His anklets are singing
and then He’s looking round and every pebble

95
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:42,220
on which He’s walking is reflecting Him,
like the souls in which He’s reflected.

96
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,990
Even Shri Krishna’s childhood is described
very well, His mischiefs, everything. All

97
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,990
these things have been described and this
is called as one of the moods. As we have,

98
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,170
you see, nine moods described, one of the
moods is vatsalya, vatsalya rus. Or “rus”

99
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,170
means kya kahengey usko[Mother speaks in Hindi
and It Means what we will call that?] rus

100
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,620
means the essence of a poetry where that gives
you a feeling, is rus. This is not there in

101
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:31,150
the western idea, you see. They just think
of romance only, nothing else. So they don’t

102
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:39,670
have rusa in their mind. We have nine rus,
out of which this vatsalya rus is the best.

103
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:49,350
We have bhakti rus when you have bhakti for
someone. Also we have shringar, but shringar

104
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:56,490
is only between husband and wife and also
just before marriage, once marriage is settled

105
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:03,490
or you know you are going to marry such and
such. That’s a shringar rus.

106
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,660
Like that, we have also vibatsya means…xxxx
[word is UNCLEAR] — see something very ugly,

107
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:16,660
described the death or something you describe
the vultures eating, eating the corpses. All

108
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,290
this is also described as Vibhatsya.

109
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,040
So we have nine ragas, Mother corrects nine
rusas and these rusas are - you must have

110
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,040
seen in some dances they must have shown.
One is also of anger and when a person gets

111
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,930
anger, you see how his anger is expressed
and — in words, but then later on this thing,

112
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,870
this anger is also depicted and all these
rusas are depicted in the form of dancing

113
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:08,240
— dancing also which is a very, very fast,
we can say, fast movement. And these fast

114
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,959
movements are also shown very — these all
nine rusas can be shown in one dance. See

115
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:27,879
how one changes from one to another and then
to another.

116
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:34,879
So it is a very deep understanding of human
beings, but as far as the children are concerned,

117
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,090
I think Indians love them the most. They love
them, but, on the, though because of their

118
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,820
love, they discipline. If you love your children,
you must discipline them.

119
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,820
Today I just wanted to tell you that the children
are to be brought up in a proper way. That

120
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:06,369
means you shouldn’t spoil them, firstly.
Now, we have problems of children who came

121
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:13,369
to see Me and they’re telling that these
children cannot fit into the pattern of our

122
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:18,179
Sahaja Yoga school in Dharamsala.

123
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:25,179
So one child is a very adamant child, extremely
adamant and you tell him something he goes

124
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:35,649
on more doing the same thing and if you say,
‘I’ll punish you.’ ‘All right, don’t

125
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:40,840
give me food. Don’t do this.’ He is so
adamant and he’s developed this kind of

126
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,119
a funny situation.

127
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,889
Now definitely such a child, we should say,
is possessed. He’s not a normal child, the

128
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:55,850
possessed child and one has to deal with that
child in that manner. Another child could

129
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,850
be who is a back-number in the class, can
be. Now the back-number child is the child

130
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:10,779
which, which is also possessed, maybe in some
depressive mood he must have felt something,

131
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,940
he lost his brother or something. So he’s
become depressive. He’s depressed and when

132
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,940
he’s depressed then what he’s doing that
he is always sulking and he cannot pay attention

133
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,360
to his work and he’s not so good.

134
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Thirdly, there are children who are not disciplined
at all. Maybe the father is not disciplined,

135
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:45,789
the mother is not disciplined. They’re not
at all disciplined and you cannot discipline

136
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:52,789
them. It’s very troublesome and they make
such problems. They go on answering.

137
00:19:54,179 --> 00:20:01,179
The fourth category of children that they
have reported are really very violent type,

138
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:09,879
extremely violent. They want to bash this,
break that and every sort of thing. It is

139
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:17,169
impossible to understand why they do it, but
My own theory is this: that if the children

140
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,259
are told all the time that this very important,
carpet is important, ‘Don’t spoil this,’

141
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:30,259
all material nonsense we talk to them, then
these children sort of develop an kind of

142
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,610
an antagonistic, you can say, or a kind of
a opposition to that kind of a suppression

143
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:47,629
and then they want to destroy everything that
they see as a possession.

144
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,690
So how should we manage these things is a
big problem. The last and the least is the

145
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:03,129
most horrifying thing is that they start taking
to sex life very early, very early. They’ll

146
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:13,230
enter into the teacher’s bed or into some
friend’s beds and that’s horrible. And

147
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:24,059
for this, I don’t know whom to blame, but
maybe that, again we can say gene. But the

148
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:36,029
newspapers, the media, all those things are
teaching children all these things. Horrible

149
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:43,029
films we have. I mean, they’re, they come
to hell, born into hell. So they learn these

150
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:50,539
things sometimes, I don’t know how and it’s
very difficult to get these things out of

151
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:57,879
their mind. There’s no innocence at all.
At a very, very young age they do it. Some

152
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:06,239
people say that because children are sometimes
molested or something, so they develop this

153
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:12,980
in their childhood and they go on developing
it more and more and more. But still, I just

154
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,700
don’t know what is child molestation is
suppose to be. Why such stupid feelings come

155
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,629
into people’s mind? They also ruin their
own children.

156
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:32,629
So if you see the whole thing is, there’s
one point is missing, and that is, we don’t

157
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:42,529
love our children as we should. We should
punish them in case we find they’re not

158
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:51,049
all right. It is our duty to teach them discipline,
not only for their good, for the good of the

159
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,980
whole society. There’s a story in India
that there was one thief and then he murdered

160
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:11,139
people. He did this and he did that. So he
was to be hanged. They asked him, ‘Have

161
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,450
you any desire before being hanged?’ He
said, ‘Only one. Please call my mother.’

162
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:27,450
So they called the mother and he went and
bit her hard on her hand. Say, ‘Why are

163
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,059
you doing this?’ He said, ‘Because when
I did the first crime, you didn’t say anything

164
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:42,059
to me. You tried to hide it and you didn’t
do anything to me. That’s why now I am being

165
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:50,859
hanged. So it was your duty to correct me
at that time, whichever way it was possible,

166
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:57,669
but you did not do it.’

167
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:03,899
So, the love of a person should not be such
that it should spoil people. Say now, if I’m

168
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:09,070
your Mother, I love you very much, you know
that very well and you also love Me, but if

169
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,450
I have to correct you, I must have courage
to correct you and tell you what I want you

170
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:21,450
to do. You need not get into temper or anger.
I seldom, I am think very seldom, I really

171
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:27,489
get angry with people. But you have to tell
them.

172
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:32,889
So you start now as you are Sahaja Yogis,
your children are born realized and Sahaja

173
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:38,359
Yogis the other way round. ‘That you are
all Sahaja Yogi,’ you tell your children,

174
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,489
‘You can’t behave like that.’ Put the
dignity into their mind. Tell them that this

175
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:50,489
is the way you have to behave, otherwise you
are not Sahaja Yogis. Give them the credentials,

176
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,109
I would say of Sahaja Yoga, that you are Sahaja
Yogis, you are born realized, you cannot behave

177
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:05,109
like that. But I have seen some people try
to fight with others for their own children,

178
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:13,470
which is absolutely wrong and immature behavior.
If somebody says something to your child,

179
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:21,230
it’s all right, and you should try to accept
it very well. See that at least somebody has

180
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:28,539
told you about your child and you must correct,
is a real loving father or mother who are

181
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:36,899
concern about it, not only to protect him
and protect all the vices he is developing.

182
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:46,200
Now as it is, in the Western life there’s
such an attack on innocence, I can see this,

183
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:53,200
such a lot, because why should they kill their
children? Well, I’ve never heard of such

184
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:59,609
a thing in India, that anybody’s killing
their children. I had a washerwoman. She was

185
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:05,619
staying in our house, in our [low and Muffled]
We had quarters for them and she had eleven

186
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:12,619
children and I had gone away to Lucknow. I
was building a house and in the meanwhile,

187
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:23,340
you see, these people they cook — what do
you call that? — starch in the house. And

188
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:30,460
in a big pot they cook it. And this, by mistake
you see, then she had so many children that

189
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:37,460
this child crawled up to it and died. I mean,
he got into it and he died. This lady had

190
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:46,100
ten children left. She was like a madwoman
— crying, weeping, not eating. When I went

191
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:51,409
back she had not had her food for twenty days.
She had not even taken water or anything,

192
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:57,759
so much she was crying. I told her, “There
are ten children you have got. Now one child

193
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:04,759
God has taken away, so why are you crying
for that child?” She couldn’t get over

194
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:12,549
it. She it - took her months to get over it,
that she has lost one child out of the eleven.

195
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,919
But when I hear of people who kill their two
children who are there and — now the children

196
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:25,820
are killing the parents. Can you imagine?
There was recently a case in England, two

197
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:32,820
boys, I think eight and ten, got hold of one
little child in the supermarket and killed

198
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:42,929
him and put him under the railway track. Imagine.
This sweet age of eight and twelve, what nice

199
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:52,659
things children can do. What nice things they
can do too, instead they went and killed one

200
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,489
child. Why? We should introspect. We should
find out.

201
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:04,159
I wouldn’t blame anybody here, but I would
say that we should understand why children

202
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:11,159
do like that. Firstly, they must get affection.
They must know somebody loves them very much

203
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:20,609
and dearly and, secondly, the respect. They
should know that they are very much respected

204
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:27,609
and they have to be repectable. Thirdly, they
should know also that they belong to a very

205
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:37,100
prestigious family of Sahaja Yogis. They can’t
do all this. Their attention also is to be

206
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,570
such that they understand what they are doing.
In the West children don’t have that attention,

207
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:53,570
I tell you. Normally, what attention we have
in the East, we don’t find it, that children,

208
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,029
even if they’re realized souls, they have
the same attention. It has to be brought in.

209
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:06,859
I remember My Mother always use to — “Where
is your attention?” all the time. She said,

210
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:12,489
“Where is Your attention?” I was quite
a philosopher, you know, so I use to go into

211
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:19,479
meditation. So she use to say, “Where is
Your attention?” I said, “Inside. It’s

212
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:26,479
all right.” But I never minded. Nobody minded
it, when she said, “Where is Your attention?”

213
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:34,080
Attention is very important thing, where it
goes, what it says. So when, say children

214
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,729
are describing something, tell you something,
they’re very sweet. You should ask them

215
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:44,509
questions. You must see that you ask them
questions and they answer you very sweet sweet

216
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:51,509
things, they answer. But in that, you should
see where is their attention, what they are

217
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:59,239
describing and what they are saying to you
because they’re realized children and the

218
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,320
realized children always talk in the third
person also. Like you tell them, ‘Now, you

219
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,919
better go home.’ So they’ll say, ‘This
boy will not go.’ I tell you, he doesn’t

220
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,190
want to go home. ‘This boy will not go,’
meaning this boy is different from the one

221
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,009
which is speaking. So they speak like that
and the way they speak and the way things

222
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:28,649
they say, it’s beautiful things they say
and one lady tried to write down certain things

223
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:34,450
the children had to say about politics, about
politician and then she wrote a book and the

224
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,909
book was sold within one week’s time. It’s
so sweet.

225
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:44,850
I mean, innately, all of us have the same
type of sweetness for our children, except

226
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,190
for some, I don’t know, what sort of people
are they who have a different reaction, but

227
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:57,190
for Sahaja Yogis, you see in collectivity,
you must try to bring your child in a manner

228
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:05,289
that he doesn’t feel that he belongs to
you only. There should be no competition.

229
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:11,239
You should also praise other children you
should, and never try to praise your child.

230
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:17,619
It’s not good manners, I tell you. It’s
not good manners to praise your child, ‘My

231
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:24,229
child is like this. My, my.’ Nothing. But
you praise others’ children first and the

232
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:31,229
child will see that also and he’ll also
praise others’ parents, not his own. If

233
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:38,759
he learns that, then the collectivity improves
that you start seeing good things in everything

234
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:43,590
and now, as I was telling you, it’s a very
dangerous situation when you read about the

235
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:50,590
genes and the no protective genes because
I remember once, one student who had gone

236
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,419
to Cambridge. He came back and he said, ‘What
surprises me, he - they take to drugs like

237
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,580
a venture. They take to anything bad like
a venture, while for us, we are frightened,

238
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,729
you know, we think this is wrong. All throughout,
we know it is wrong and we are doing wrong,

239
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:15,729
knowingly.’ So he said, I don’t, he told
Me, ‘I don’t know how they get over this

240
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,349
protectiveness.’ They just go headlong into
it, anything, you know, a love affair with

241
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:27,929
any unknown girl, they’ll sleep with anyone.
How can they do it? They don’t even think

242
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:34,929
whether it is right or wrong. That’s what
is true, that to introspect and see for yourself

243
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:42,119
whether it is good or bad, is very important.

244
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:49,119
Now also we have some national problems. Different
nationality has different problems, but in

245
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,739
Sahaja Yoga I think we are washed of all these
things. I’ve known some people who were

246
00:32:55,739 --> 00:33:01,639
drug addicts. The first seven who came to
Me, out of them four were drug addicts and

247
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,599
they told Me they couldn’t see Me. They
were just lights coming out of Me, that’s

248
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,919
all. Some sort of a miraculous photographs
they had become, I think, and they couldn’t

249
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,919
see Me in one person. And one came and just
was there like a coma, she was sitting like

250
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,470
this. So difficult and one of them was a professor
of physics from Australia. I don’t know

251
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:32,470
where he has disappeared. This fellow, he
was a professor of physics from Cambridge

252
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:41,190
and so much in the drug that I asked him,
I said, “What’s your name?” So he went

253
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:48,989
on, ‘Ah, ah.’ I said, “I asked you what’s
your name.” ‘Ah, you asked me my name?’

254
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:55,609
I said, “I did ask you.” ‘My name, You
said what is my name?’ I said, “Yes, I

255
00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:01,450
did say what is your name.” Went on for
five minutes. He could not come to terms with

256
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,830
his name even. I said, “What sort of this
drug addiction is there? [There is some word

257
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,000
but not clear] It’s too much. But then he
got all right. He improved a lot and he was

258
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
just dying with liver, but he got all right.
I took him home, treated him. He was all right.

259
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:24,650
So, you see, with such dull brains, you think
this drug definitely harms — really definitely

260
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:33,150
harms the brain cells because the way I have
seen, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they got

261
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:40,150
Realization, very intelligent people. Some
were PhDs. I call them PHD-MADs, you see.

262
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:47,150
And all of them, these PhDs and MADs, were
so much harmed, so much harmed. I asked them,

263
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:55,830
“You’re such intelligent, educated people,
why did you take to drugs — for experience

264
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:02,830
of what?” ‘Experience of spirituality.’
I said, “Who told you?” Some guru told

265
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:10,140
them or somebody told them, but I said, “In
India nobody would think that these drugs

266
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,990
can give you spirituality.” He said, ‘No.
Such and such guru came from there and he

267
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:22,990
told us that you take to — drugs and you’ll
be spiritual.’

268
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,980
I mean people like Rajneesh who try — means
all these gurus knew that if you tell them

269
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:39,070
something that are the weaknesses of human
beings they’ll take to it, easily. Not in

270
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,100
India. If Freud had come to India — I tell
you, I don’t know. He would have been cut

271
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,320
into pieces perhaps. Nobody would have tolerated
a nonsense like that, the way he was talking

272
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,990
about the mother’s love.

273
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:58,990
So all such people have been accepted blindly,
all over. See you, not only in America, but

274
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:06,750
also in this thing, U.K., there was one boy
who came to Me who was the disciple of this

275
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:14,840
fourteen year old gentleman, Guru Maharaji,
and he was actually on potato diets. So I

276
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:22,540
said, “Why are you on potato diet?” ‘Because
my guruji has said that if you give me a Rolls

277
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,290
Royce, then only I come to England.’ He
already had, I think, fifty-three or something.

278
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,410
‘ So we have to give him a Rolls Royce,
so we are on a potato diet. We are saving

279
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:38,410
money.’ I said, “Why are you doing that
— saving money for potatoes? Out of potatoes,

280
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,870
how much are you saving?” He said, ‘We
are saving quite a lot and we are sure at

281
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:51,130
the end of this year we’ll have lots of
money to buy a Rolls Royce.’ “Wah, Wah.”

282
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,280
But I said, “Why are you doing it? You see,
why do you want to give him money? Why do

283
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:01,280
you want to give a Rolls Royce?” He said,
‘Because, you see, this Rolls Royce is just

284
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:09,130
metal, but he’s going to give us the spirit.’
“Which spirit?”

285
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,790
I really — this fellow was ultimately died,
you see. This one died because I don’t know

286
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:23,790
what harm they do to people, but Rajneesh
was using all kinds of dirty tricks and people

287
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:30,810
took to it and that is why I want to tell
you that you should all be very careful. Also

288
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,590
among Sahaja Yogis we had some problem in
Melbourne. Somebody came from Portugal and

289
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:43,370
he learned certain things from Nepal and he
did some tricks there. So, among us also,

290
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:49,530
maybe somebody who thinks that he should show
that he is a great Sahaja Yogi, take to some

291
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:54,560
so-called spiritual life and try to create
problems.

292
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,930
So we should not have groups. We should have
no groups. Nothing should be a secret. Everybody

293
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:05,870
should know what everybody is doing. That
is how collectively will be all right. Because

294
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:11,510
supposing somebody comes and tells you, ‘All
right, I’ll make you something special and

295
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,830
for that this is to be done.’ It has happened
before with your leaders also, that they use

296
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,040
to tell them in their ears that, ‘Mother
has told me to do this. Mother has told me

297
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:28,040
to do.’ Never listen to such people. You’ve
got leaders whom you can ask what is good

298
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,660
and what is bad. If not, you can even write
to Me, but don’t listen to such people who

299
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,660
are telling you things just to destroy — destroy
Sahaja Yoga, destroy the only hope for the

300
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:51,140
whole world. You have to be very, very careful
about it and if you are careful, I am sure,

301
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:58,220
you have now the insight, you have now the
powers, you have now the authority. Everything

302
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:05,220
is there, no doubt, but vulnerability is the
problem I sometimes feel. For that you have

303
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:15,510
to be very, very careful because now, as you
see in Sydney, it started in a very bad way

304
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:23,450
and now we are so many sensible people sitting
here who are my children of whom I’m very

305
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:31,380
proud, very proud, but, at the same time,
please try to understand that you are surrounded

306
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:38,350
by vultures actually and the whole atmosphere
is full of such things because I see your

307
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:45,350
newspapers, I see your media and I am really
shocked. Much worse than you could see in

308
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,980
India, though in India also these things have
come now. The Western life is coming there

309
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,640
and many people are taking to it, no doubt,
but only in big cities and very few people

310
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,470
who’re suppose to be very rich or elite,
they try to do all this. This will all go

311
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,160
away, I’m sure, one day.

312
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,270
Then another point is, apart from your family,
your children, where normally people are glued

313
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:20,050
into, you are Sahaja Yogis. You are not only
for your family, for your country, but for

314
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:27,050
the whole world. Then attention should be
on all such things. For example, I read about

315
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:37,180
what is happening in Johannesburg or in Natal
and how the people are massacred there and

316
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:43,630
what they are doing there. I was very disturbed,
couldn’t sleep — very disturbed — and

317
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:50,630
I decided this year I must go to South Africa.

318
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:06,490
Also Yugoslav is another problem where these
stupid Muslims are killing themselves. All

319
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:14,810
their funny ideas are working out in such
a disastrous way that they must die now in

320
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:23,280
the name of God, so after the Qiyamah comes
in, the Resurrection time comes in, they’ll

321
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,900
come out of their graves and they’ll get
Resurrection. Such stupid ideas are also for

322
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:36,810
Christians, for Muslims and also for Jews.
Now, imagine those who die five hundred years

323
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:43,810
back, what will come out of their graves?
But the sensible idea is from Nav Damyan Vyakhayan

324
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:53,360
that all the souls will be born again and
there will be population problem, but they’ll

325
00:41:54,890 --> 00:42:01,870
be born again. Souls will take forms and they
will seek their Realization and many will

326
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:07,460
get Realization, which is a very sensible
thing to say that the souls, not the body,

327
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,540
from the graves and that’s why they were
occupying such a lot of land all over, that

328
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:20,540
in Spain, what they do is to put the dead
bodies in rocks like this. They cut a piece

329
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,360
and push it there, one after another. They
go on pushing all these coffins inside a rock

330
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,210
like that, all over. I was wondering what
is this made like this, like a drawers, you

331
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:41,750
know. In these drawers they put it and they
push it in. They’re all dead there and they’re

332
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:47,910
all going to come out when there will be Resurrection
time and all of them are going to get their

333
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:54,910
Realization. That’s why these people, Muslims
in sari jagaha [Mother speaks in Hindi means

334
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:04,150
“everywhere”], you can call it the Yugoslav,
Yugoslavia, they are killing themselves, stupidly.

335
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:10,930
Also they have no wisdom to see that this
is wrong. How can it be that our dead bodies

336
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:17,930
will come out?

337
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:28,490
(Mother speak aside ).

338
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:58,750
So now our attention should be global. If
Sahaja Yogis put their attentions, you see,

339
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:05,110
global, you don’t know your powers, how
important it is. Just put your attention now,

340
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:12,110
say, to South Africa in the Natal where they
are having all these problems of suppression.

341
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:20,690
It will help — very much help, you don’t
know. Things will subside because through

342
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:27,690
you this all-pervading power, Paramchaitanya,
will focus itself there. You are the one who

343
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:36,660
can focus. You should have your global attention
there and you should see for yourself very

344
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,440
serious problem. I’m doing on My Own whatever
is possible. For that you must read newspapers,

345
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:51,210
but not all the nonsense of the newspaper,
but see where is the problem is, what is happening.

346
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:57,940
Because you’re in Sydney, but you’re responsible
for the whole world. Wherever you are, you

347
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,790
are responsible for the whole world.

348
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:05,730
Now there’s a very good thing that has happened
in Russia. I don’t know if you have that

349
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:12,730
paper with you? Russian paper? No. You have
that?

350
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:31,370
And see the Russian University of St. Petersburg
which is the oldest in Asia, perhaps oldest

351
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:39,010
in the whole world, has got now only ten people
as member of their Academy and one of them

352
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,880
is Me, I’m surprised. So — so when they
applied — you see, they applied for My membership,

353
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:02,710
they wrote — I can’t read it — it’s
too much for Me. They wrote, you see, this

354
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:12,430
application and why, I mean, saying that I
should be appointed as one of the members.

355
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:18,420
Einstein is one of the members, can you imagine.
I was surprised that they have put Me with

356
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:25,420
Einstein. And I was quite ashamed, though
it was done. So they said, ‘What? What is

357
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,700
Einstein? What has he done? He is just working
with the matter, but You have worked with

358
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:38,700
human beings, You see.’ So, can you read
it out?

359
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:12,240
A gentleman reads the letter: 
‘This is addressed to the Presidium of the

360
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:33,140
Peter’s Academy of Arts and Sciences. It’s
the official presentation of Shri Mataji Nirmala

361
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:40,140
Devi for election as an Honored Member of
the Academy. Mrs. Nirmala Srivastava, Doctor

362
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:50,260
of Philosophy and Medicine, a Distinguished
Authority on the fields of Religion, Philosophy

363
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:02,230
and Science, by Her noble activity does very
much to promote happiness and friendship of

364
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:09,410
Indian and Russian peoples and all the nations
of the world. She was always regarding our

365
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:16,410
land as a center of the world’s spirituality
and morality, center of rapprochement, people

366
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:24,050
of Western Orient, the centre of the revival
of sublime ideals which have been put forth

367
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:31,560
by Russians and many other nations of Russia.
Being the founder of the elevating teaching

368
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:41,430
of Sahaja Yoga, Mrs. Nirmala Devi Srivastava
absolutely, reliably connects physical and

369
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:52,030
psychic health of a man with the mode of his
life and morality. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

370
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:02,750
was born in 1923 on the 23 rd ( Error in the
birthdate …to check was it in the original

371
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:09,990
letter ) of March in Chindwara, central part
of India in the noble Christian family. Having

372
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:19,560
revealed Her extraordinary abilities already
in childhood, later She got the high medical

373
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,560
education and took an active part in the struggle
for the National Independence of India. In

374
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:36,950
1947 She married Mr. Srivastava and now They
have two daughters. Sir C.P. Srivastava for

375
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:53,380
sixteen years occupied the post of General
Secretary of the International Naval Organization

376
00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:01,090
of the United Nations, having been unanimously
elected for this post three times in succession,

377
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:10,650
now he is the honored General Secretary of
this agency. During the elections to the Prime

378
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Minister of India, Sir Srivastava held office
of General Secretary. He was rewarded by thirty-four

379
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:28,080
awards of different countries. The Queen of
England marked his retirement, granting him

380
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,480
honorary title of Knight-Commander of the
Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. Mrs.

381
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:44,820
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and Mr. C.P. Srivastava,
considering the Russian people to be spiritual

382
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:52,410
and pure, see in our Motherland the center
of spiritual revival of the world. Being absolutely

383
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:02,450
sincere from the bottom of my heart, I recommend
to the Presidium of Peter’s Academy of Arts

384
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:09,710
and Sciences to elect Shri Mataji Nirmala
Devi to be an Honored Member of our Academy.’

385
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:18,310
“And this was spoken by the Vice-President
of Peter’s Academy of Arts and Sciences,

386
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,000
Mr. Varanov.”]

387
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Talk restarts from here:

388
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:46,160
Very nice man. He even came to My Puja. Can
you imagine? He did the Puja and gave Me some

389
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:59,730
very nice present also and I told him that
I have never graduated in science or philosophy

390
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:07,920
or anything, so he said, ‘ That’s why
You are so great.’ I said, “Why?” ‘Because

391
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,890
none of the discoverers have ever been to
colleges, or university.’ Very nice person,

392
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:20,810
very nice and he’s willing to come to India
any time you want.

393
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:27,810
Then I met another personality who is called
as Ayatollah, means the person in charge of

394
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:35,390
Religion. His name was Rohani Ayatollah and
Rohani Ayatollah is a gentleman — Ruhani.

395
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:43,870
“Ruha” means this all-pervading power
or spiritual. So he was in charge of Religion

396
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:50,870
when the - there was this rule of the King
and afterwards he had to run away from there

397
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,680
and he came to Paris and settled down there.
Now, his younger brother is also an Irani,

398
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:14,660
is voted for becoming the new President of
Iran. So this old one, the one who is a very

399
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:23,740
strict and, you can say, a very fundamentalist
type, he arrested those six families which

400
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:33,350
supported him and took a affidavit from them
saying that ‘No, they are not going to support

401
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:40,350
him.’ But, if you all put your attention
to it, he might be, he might be elected and

402
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:49,240
if he’s elected that’s the saving of the
Muslims there because they’re Shia people

403
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,140
and this Rohani gentleman is so wonderful.
He touched My Feet and he danced when he got

404
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,080
his Realization.

405
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:04,080
I mean, some things are happening which are
so much of a joy. Even in My country I find

406
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:11,380
— India — that there’s a big recognition
of Sahaja Yoga and which is so obvious that

407
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:17,830
people are recognizing the purity of Sahaj
Yoga.

408
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:24,830
Let us see how far we can go. But in Brazil
also they have — the President of the Senate

409
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,920
called Me, got his Realization, he was very
happy. He called his secretary, everybody,

410
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,460
asked them to get their Realization and then
they sent — you see, they said that Brasilia

411
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:46,460
is what they have selected, is the one is
depicted by some philosophers as this center

412
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,800
of spirituality. And when they came, he called
all other people also and their Vice-President

413
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:09,360
was there. The President was already impeached.
So this Vice-President, I never liked him.

414
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,740
I said, “Funny person he is.” And then
he was arrested.

415
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:20,740
So, so many things — like Italy also — lots
of things are happening. Maybe all this might

416
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:27,770
just change the atmosphere. You know about
Marcus who was in Vienna, who troubled us

417
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:40,710
so much, did so much against us in the newspaper
and all that? This Marcus fellow, I don’t

418
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,810
know what has gone wrong with him or he’s
come round. Now, he’s saying that you can

419
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:50,930
live in this Ashram for two years without
paying any rent. I’ll also give you money

420
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,890
that you can purchase a land. Afterwards,
you can leave the house and he says, ‘The

421
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:02,890
maya was too much for me and I got lost. I
hope I’ll be back again in Ganapatipule.’

422
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:09,730
Can you imagine.

423
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:16,730
So all such things are happening and it’s
tremendous because you can’t expect a person

424
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:26,990
like Marcus coming around like that, you see.
So Sahaja Yoga is showing its own success

425
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:35,380
and you all can add to it. You have seen among,
among yourselves only, there are so many beautiful

426
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:42,170
people who come out of lot of troubles. All
troubles can be overcome. There’s no problem

427
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:49,170
about it. Only thing, one has to be sincere
and attached to Sahaja Yoga. You may be a

428
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:55,080
family man, you might be a father, mother,
anything, but first and foremost thing, you

429
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,340
are a Sahaja Yogi.

430
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:03,340
I tell you about Myself also. You know I have
a family. I have My husband and all that and

431
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:13,070
whenever, you see, it was needed, I always
said, “Sahaja Yoga first.” Even money-wise,

432
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:20,580
I would say that, if you have to spend any
money, then spend on Sahaj Yoga. So the first

433
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:27,580
thing was Sahaja Yoga. All these are secondary,
all your art, all your business, all your

434
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:35,460
music or whatever line of life you take, is
a second. The first and foremost thing is

435
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:42,730
Sahaja Yoga and you get in that everything,
but should do it very sincerely, respectfully.

436
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
If you think you are not in it, then you better
understand that if you’re not in it, you

437
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:56,180
cannot be there. You have to be fully into
it, you see. So either you are in the sea

438
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:01,500
or you are outside. It’s like that. And
this will give you the greatest pleasure,

439
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:08,500
the greatest fulfillment of life. I can see
that’s happening now and I’m very happy

440
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:15,290
and, as I said, I’m very proud of you. It
should happen everywhere and with all My love

441
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:22,150
I bless you that you all should really become
great Sahaja Yogis, very, very great Sahaja

442
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:29,150
Yogis and you’ll be all known all over the
world.

443
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,200
May God bless. So thank you very much.
