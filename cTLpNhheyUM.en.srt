1
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:39,450
We all are expecting something great to happen 
and the happening that has to take place has

2
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,780
been already described in all the scriptures.

3
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:56,759
But somehow we are misled by other people 
who have a better way of manifesting their

4
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:14,410
own style and we get so confused because this 
is the time of great confusion.

5
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,180
Without the confusion evolution cannot take 
place.

6
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,870
Unless and until people are confused they 
will never try to aspire for something higher.

7
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:39,560
If you see in the animal stage also, there 
was a confusion for the fishes to come out,

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,000
and that confusion made one or two to lead 
the rest of them and that’s how they could

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,569
crawl onto this Mother Earth with confidence.

10
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:01,700
So the areas started changing gradually, that, 
from Mother Earth then they started looking

11
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,810
towards the sky.

12
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,250
And the evolution went on like this till the 
human beings were created.

13
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:22,129
Now, all these areas are within ourselves.

14
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:33,880
These are all the elements into which we had 
to probe into: we had to find about them.

15
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:43,509
And through this evolution we have been able 
to look into these, to fathom them, to find

16
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:47,260
out their nature through our intelligence.

17
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:57,169
So we reached this point where we could understand 
the elements, we could understand their use

18
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,750
for our purpose.

19
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,250
So far so good.

20
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,140
But that’s not the end.

21
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,130
That’s not the end of our evolution.

22
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:18,989
If it was then there would have been no more 
search, there would have been no more seeking,

23
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:27,009
people would have been happy, would have been 
satisfied, but that’s not so.

24
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:34,259
So there has to be something more that we 
have to achieve.

25
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:53,250
At this time of great confusion we have certain 
lamp posts, we can say, or beacons, to guide

26
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,300
us and these beacons are all the scriptures.

27
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:07,590
Now these scriptures are also so much being 
misused and misrepresented and explained in

28
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,630
such a funny way and everything made into 
a money-making proposition, that it adds to

29
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,320
the confusion more.

30
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,910
So you get much more confused and confused 
and confused.

31
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,590
Imagine the light that has to show your path 
becomes an illusion: how are you to find your

32
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,090
path then.

33
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,930
But this is the pastime of human beings, you 
can’t help it.

34
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,770
You give them everything and they can convert 
it into a confusion.

35
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:54,290
You can see the results of these in our politicians, 
in our economists, our psychologists: all

36
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:02,080
of them seem to be quite confused, and they 
don’t know what the other person is saying,

37
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,240
what they are saying.

38
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,870
And they cannot relate it to something absolute.

39
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,530
So we have to find out that absolute point 
where this confusion drops out.

40
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:27,660
At this level only you can find it out, at 
this level only it can be given, at this level

41
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,770
only that will manifest.

42
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,440
Before this, at any other stage it is impossible.

43
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,220
It was impossible and it is impossible.

44
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,000
So at human stage only it is going to manifest.

45
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,320
But human beings also must know that they 
have some drawbacks compared to other stages.

46
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:06,300
At the animal stage or even earlier stages 
you can say: at the element stage.

47
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,660
Elements don’t have to think.

48
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,300
They don’t have any choice.

49
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,160
They don’t have to bother about anything.

50
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,190
They just exist.

51
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:23,330
They are not aware of anything; they are just 
existing with whatever are their qualities:

52
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,940
say hydrogen is hydrogen, oxygen is oxygen.

53
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,419
They are bound by different valencies and 
different qualities and their chemical compounds

54
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:44,530
and their physical powers by which they act, 
react and exist.

55
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:56,380
Then when the life started itself, at that 
time also, life was guided, very much by nature.

56
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,229
The evolution was very much controlled by 
nature.

57
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,640
I’ll give you an example of that.

58
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,280
A gentleman who has written a very nice book 
– I would not give you the name because

59
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,720
you will immediately buy that book and start 
reading the whole thing – but he was experimenting

60
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,729
with some oysters and he had them first in 
Los Angeles where the sea was.

61
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:36,270
And he found out that when the tide was low 
these shells used to open themselves up, the

62
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,959
oysters, and when it was high tide they would 
close down because the water should not run

63
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,350
into them.

64
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:50,630
And you know that the tide time is bound everywhere: 
anybody can calculate it sitting down here

65
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,440
what is the tide in Falkland.

66
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,240
So he removed those shells from there, brought 
them to Ohio which is very far away and there

67
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,070
is no sea and he put them down there and they 
were opening at the same time.

68
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,020
Now see: the time changes according to the 
moon, so the water was acting according to

69
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,600
the moon and these oysters were also acting 
according to the moon.

70
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,240
But when the time changed, they came to Ohio, 
still they had that habit and they were opening.

71
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:38,180
But suddenly they changed and they took to 
the timing which would happen if the sea was

72
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,509
there in Ohio!

73
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:45,120
So they were so much bound still by nature.

74
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:56,540
Nature controls them, and up to a great point, 
nature even controlled human beings.

75
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:08,300
But in the animal stage one has to know that, 
to find out the difference between an animal

76
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:18,519
and a vegetable, what happened was, first 
the cellular wall was doubled.

77
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:28,160
So element was first put into a cell to make 
a vegetable and the vegetable was given a

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,819
double wall to make it an animal.

79
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:45,269
Now [an] animal that has become a human being 
has a triple bond, that’s why is the confusion.

80
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:53,019
That we call as ‘human freedom’: that 
we are free to do what we like: “What’s

81
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,019
wrong?”

82
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,019
Correct!

83
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,009
I mean if somebody wants to commit suicide, 
what’s wrong?

84
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,949
Somebody wants to kill his father, what’s 
wrong?

85
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:05,220
I mean laws according to many people is all 
artificial, man-made — is correct.

86
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,699
So, what’s wrong?

87
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,480
So we were bound thrice.

88
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:20,529
The third binding came when, as human beings, 
we started acting, creating our ego as a by-product

89
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,149
of that action, physical and mental.

90
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,829
We developed ourselves into an egg.

91
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:32,350
We became just like eggs and this egg had 
three shells.

92
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:40,699
First one of the human shell, second of the 
animal, and third that of the vegetables and

93
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,750
inside that were all the elements.

94
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,160
That’s how we are made.

95
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,699
But for what?

96
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,910
Why?

97
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,980
Why this freedom was given to us?

98
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,529
To get us confused?

99
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:10,399
Because we had to go to a higher evolutionary 
state, and that higher evolutionary state

100
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:19,610
has to give us complete freedom from all these 
three bondages: the vegetable bondage which

101
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:30,800
makes you stick to one place, the animal bondage 
where you cannot think, and human bondage

102
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,329
where you think.

103
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,930
Man can’t live without thinking: it’s 
a bondage.

104
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,389
We can’t get out of it.

105
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,290
Like horns it grows into your head.

106
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,879
You can’t stop it you know.

107
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,850
Even if you cut your throat you cannot stop 
it, some people say – it’s surprising.

108
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,329
It’s so bad, it’s such a bondage in us.

109
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,629
All the time we think, think, think.

110
00:12:55,629 --> 00:13:01,249
This is the third bondage: of human being.

111
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:05,860
But what happens with this when this bondage 
is broken?

112
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,329
Light comes in, through the light.

113
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:22,519
And this light gives you enlightenment in 
all the three prisons into which you are imprisoned;

114
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:31,689
and you get a complete integration into all 
these different bondages within you and you

115
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:42,509
start seeing the absolute truth: that all 
this is bound by one thread.

116
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:52,389
All these elements, all these vegetables, 
animals, human beings are bound by one thread.

117
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:58,720
And when you start seeing that thread as a 
witness, you start seeing the play of all

118
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,929
these elements, of all these bondages — beautifully.

119
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:12,579
But there’s a very great difference between 
the other evolution and the evolution of man

120
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:13,579
at this stage.

121
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:25,449
It’s a very great difference I think, which 
very few people realise: that before the evolution

122
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:33,990
up to human stage, you are not aware of it 
and you can’t do anything about it at all.

123
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:44,170
Supposing a seed evolves into a better fruit 
— it doesn’t have to do anything about

124
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,230
it, somebody else has to do.

125
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,300
If you sprout a seed then you have to look 
after it throughout.

126
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,559
Sprout the seed then take the seedlings, put 
them right somewhere then let them grow into

127
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,939
a tree, then you have to prune the tree.

128
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:07,829
Whatever you have to do, you have to do all 
the time, you have to look after the tree.

129
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:17,009
But after this evolution, this jumping, this 
happening, when you become the Self, you have

130
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:22,649
to do something about it: you have to.

131
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:29,339
Because you become the master of your being.

132
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,859
It is you who has to work it out.

133
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:40,670
In Sahaja Yoga there are many people who get 
Realisation: it’s very easy.

134
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,720
The confusion is so great that people want 
to come out of it, [so] they get it.

135
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:54,569
But again they are drawn back into it because 
that time which is so important, the intermediary

136
00:15:54,569 --> 00:16:05,350
time, where you have to stick on to that area, 
to that new dimension of collective consciousness,

137
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:15,029
your willpower doesn’t act, and that is 
the time you require this will power.

138
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,730
Already you are exhausted.

139
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:25,040
So many are exhausted because of seeking, 
because of worrying, because of thinking,

140
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,449
wrong seeking, gurus, this that.

141
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:33,720
All kinds of exhaustions are there: family 
life, married life.

142
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,519
Every sort of problem that you have faced, 
you have already exhausted your willpower.

143
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:47,279
And when even you get Realised, you have the 
cup, but you have no strength to lift, within

144
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:57,069
yourself, to raise it to your mouth and to 
enjoy the nectar of your Realisation.

145
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,439
More so in places that are supposed to be 
developed.

146
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:09,459
In developing that part of your systems you 
have exhausted yourself much more.

147
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:18,900
I mean it was all right up to a point, but 
when human beings know something, they’ll

148
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,410
go to the extreme end of everything.

149
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:29,740
Now, if you know electricity, then everything 
must work on electricity, your lift will work

150
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,860
on electricity, this will work on electricity, 
now computers have come, all right.

151
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,510
Now they will make human beings into electrical 
electrodes!

152
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,840
I don’t know what they’re going to make 
out of that.

153
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,130
I mean, going to that extent.

154
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,540
But then electricity fails — finished!

155
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,610
Now petrol has started — use petrol as much 
as you like, all right.

156
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,770
Now petrol is getting exhausted.

157
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,830
So there’s a shock, future shock condition.

158
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,020
In a trauma we sit.

159
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,910
In that confused state you are in a shocked 
state, “Oh God what’s going to happen

160
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,910
to us?”

161
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:09,640
But why play into the hands of these things 
to that extent.

162
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:15,100
The countries which are not so developed, 
we can say countries which are a little underdeveloped

163
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,130
and developed: where a motor car runs and 
a bullock cart also runs.

164
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:28,280
If the motor car fails they can use the oxes 
to run the motor cars, we call it ‘Ox Ford’.

165
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
(laughter)

166
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,830
So one can rely on something else, there is 
an alternative already available.

167
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,580
But when you cut out all the alternatives, 
then how can you find out an alternative.

168
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,180
For example, now we’ve got calculators.

169
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,799
I was amazed in the shop: they can’t count 
one, two, three, four, five.

170
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,390
If they make mistakes in somewhere, if you 
tell them that, that’s a mistake, because

171
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,080
you know how to calculate, they say, “How 
can it be?

172
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,110
The machine is not wrong."

173
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,840
But your fingers were wrong somewhere.

174
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,560
They have no alternatives left now.

175
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,311
I mean they have to depend on the electricity.

176
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:11,360
They have to depend on petrol.

177
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,350
You have to depend on all these elements.

178
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:23,730
So if you find with a little detachment: we 
are already slaves of all these elements.

179
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,650
Instead of becoming free birds, we have become 
now slaves of this.

180
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,910
So we start finding out alternatives.

181
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,310
Now what can alternatives we can have?

182
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,260
We have lost all deftness to do any hand work.

183
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,140
After some time I think people won’t be 
able to clean their dishes, they will need

184
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,250
a machine.

185
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,510
As it is they can’t clean their clothes 
I think, they can’t comb their hair.

186
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,170
What’s going to happen?

187
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,120
You will need even a machine to feed you!

188
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,310
Going to that extent: when we go up to such 
a limit that we become absolute slaves.

189
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,080
The confusion is worse.

190
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,530
But after Realisation the whole thing changes.

191
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,300
All the priorities change, you become a different 
person.

192
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,630
It’s a tremendous change that comes within 
you.

193
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,790
But to appreciate it, to understand it and 
use it, you have to stabilise yourself because

194
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,380
you are still shaking.

195
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,710
And it’s very easy to go back to the life 
which you have lead so far.

196
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,040
We have had people coming from all works of 
life.

197
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,380
We had bureaucrats.

198
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,650
We had people who were hippies.

199
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:44,220
They must belong to some club: “Are you 
a communist or a socialist?”

200
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,270
Like when I came here, they asked me, “What 
is your politics?”

201
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,640
I looked at them.

202
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,000
I said, “Which one?”

203
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,570
They said, “I mean what politics we have.

204
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,350
What is yours?”

205
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,940
I said, “I don’t know."

206
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,100
Quite confused you see.

207
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,940
I was quite confused, because I had no politics 
at all.

208
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:17,900
There’s only one politics for me, that is 
the politics of the Divine, of God: where

209
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,000
He plays His tricks on all human beings; I 
see that every day.

210
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,930
They don’t know, but He’s playing tricks 
on everyone: on nations, on human beings,

211
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,190
on all organisations.

212
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,960
He’s playing tricks all the time to make 
you learn so many things, but you don’t

213
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
want to learn.

214
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,450
That’s the only politics.

215
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,430
These politics are nothing but children’s 
play, they are of no use.

216
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,860
This is just you want to play with cards and 
you sit down and play; that’s all, to me.

217
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,370
Otherwise there’s no politics for me.

218
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,340
What is economics of God?

219
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,010
That’s the only economics that reins.

220
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,250
No other economics reins for me.

221
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,310
His economics is that matter doesn’t give 
you joy.

222
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:13,410
He gives you something that gives you joy, 
that gives you compassion, love, security,

223
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,160
health, innocence.

224
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:25,830
Above all it gives you the power to love others: 
tremendous power it is.

225
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,540
We have never used the power of love, never.

226
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,170
Always we have used the power of hatred.

227
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,900
All our politics and economics is based on 
hatred.

228
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:46,670
We create goods to sell by seeing what weaknesses 
people have: like England or America and all

229
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,990
these Western countries.

230
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:56,000
In India the crooks found out that there are 
many seekers in these countries — all right,

231
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
export all the crooks!

232
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,080
They all came out of the jail and are here 
back.

233
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,810
They have got Rolls Royces, they have got 
big, big huge houses, they have got huge big

234
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:12,130
aeroplanes and you can’t see that.

235
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,840
This is the economics of human beings.

236
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:24,320
But God’s economics is such that if you 
have any want, it looks after you.

237
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,350
But it gives you a desire for the right type 
of wants.

238
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:36,700
Because the whole system changes, the whole 
value system changes.

239
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:45,110
A person who is a realised-soul would like 
to have vibrations flowing all the time.

240
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,140
Today I had taken my grandchildren to a shop 
to buy them a sweater.

241
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,810
It’s very difficult because they are realised-souls, 
all of them.

242
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,550
So I gave them a very beautiful one.

243
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,960
I said, “How do you like it?”

244
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,230
They said, “No, it’s very uncomfortable."

245
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,230
It was acrylic.

246
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,090
They just can’t have it.

247
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,370
I said, “But it’s quite nice and cheap."

248
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,020
So she refused to have it.

249
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,900
Then it was semi-acrylic: refused to have 
it.

250
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,320
Then I gave her wool.

251
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:22,090
I said, “But this wool will be only one 
when you can have ten like these if you buy

252
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,090
acrylic."

253
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:29,460
She said, “Better to have one which you 
can wear, than to have ten which you cannot

254
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,460
wear."

255
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,360
The whole value system changes, to have too 
many things becomes useless!

256
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,010
Have one which is comfortable to your being.

257
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:48,540
Somehow they have reached even rationally, 
through your science and to such points, that

258
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,240
Sahaja Yoga just fits into it.

259
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,560
I sometimes feel all these things have created 
the beautiful ring for the diamond of Sahaja

260
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,390
Yoga to just fit into it.

261
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:07,410
For example people are now realising that 
there is no sense in creating plastic.

262
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:16,390
But say about thirty years back, people would 
have been proud to have a sofa set made out

263
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,000
of plastic.

264
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,730
We had a ship from Norway, I remember, about 
thirty years back, and they were going round

265
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:36,720
to show us how they had made plastic railings 
for the staircases: beautiful plastic railings.

266
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,380
And we were all very much enamoured in India, 
how they had made it.

267
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,180
While we can make very beautiful carvings, 
but we thought this was wonderful: looks so

268
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,770
nice, washable, you can wash it, no polishing 
needed, no painting needed, wonderful thing

269
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,140
you know, just go ahead with it.

270
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:00,080
But now the same Norwegians are asking Indians 
to create some things for them out of wood.

271
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:10,890
So the whole value system changes, as soon 
as you start feeling your Self, your being.

272
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:19,150
Because your being is absolute: it is truth, 
and its complete beauty manifests when you

273
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:27,410
start, with your willpower, accepting the 
new challenge that is given to you.

274
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,770
And that is the time where this built-in ego 
of ages stands out: “Why?

275
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,240
Why to do like this?”

276
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,440
So many things in the society that we have, 
whether in India or here or anywhere in the

277
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,480
whole world, are so shocking that only after 
Realisation you realise that you have been

278
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,390
going on with it all these lives and your 
parents have been and their parents have been.

279
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,460
It’s absolutely a shocking thing.

280
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,840
But for that you have to first get your Realisation.

281
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,670
That part is not so difficult, as I told you, 
because the time has come for many to get

282
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,670
Realisation.

283
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:15,420
But how many will enjoy it you cannot say, 
because Mr Ego is the worst enemy of human

284
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
beings.

285
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:23,110
First of all they cannot take it from anyone 
else but themselves.

286
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,870
This is the big problem.

287
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,051
“All right,” I say, “even take that 
way!”

288
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:32,250
But it cannot be done.

289
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,140
Now supposing somebody has to do it: it’s 
not a very easy thing you know, it’s a very

290
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,800
difficult thing to do such a thing, and it’s 
horribly embarrassing.

291
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,810
You have to do something which people think 
they can do themselves!You can imagine how

292
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,510
embarrassing it is.

293
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,120
Only a Mother can take such a situation that 
she knows her children are like that, doesn’t

294
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
matter.

295
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,630
But any other person would say, “Go to hell 
what do I care!

296
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,860
Why should I take the responsibility of anybody 
and why should I say all these things to them?

297
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,680
If they are so egoistical, let them go to 
hell!”

298
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,370
This is what is really the situation.

299
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,240
But supposing somebody is nothing but compassion 
and love: supposing.

300
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,160
I mean, it’s a supposition for many people: 
they can’t believe it.

301
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,020
Supposing someone is, then someone has to 
do it.

302
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,670
And if someone has to do it why be so angry 
about it?

303
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:30,560
This I have failed to understand.

304
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:39,250
Like in Spain one gentleman got Realisation 
and he couldn’t believe that it has happened.

305
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,350
And he came to me and argued with me in a 
very funny manner.

306
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,870
He said, “But why is it you had to do it?”

307
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,920
I said, “You do it!”

308
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,180
(laughter) That he can’t do!

309
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,870
I said, “All right, now if you are angry 
for that…”

310
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,150
Because it has happened in my presence, he 
was angry with me.

311
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,760
He was thinking why shouldn’t he do it.

312
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,610
I said, “All right now you can do it but 
before this you could not!”

313
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,830
So he was very angry for that also.

314
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,700
He said, “Why should God make one person 
do it?”

315
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,390
I said, “It’s really horrible I tell you!

316
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,720
If He had given one hundred people to do it, 
it would be much better.

317
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,160
I would have taken some rest myself.

318
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,880
Because I am already sixty years of age and 
when am I going to retire?

319
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
But it’s not so.

320
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,690
What can I do?”

321
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,640
Then he was still angry with me.

322
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,410
He said, “But must be something why you 
are doing it."

323
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,660
I said, “Yes there is!”

324
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,840
“What is it?”

325
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,460
I said, “Love."

326
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,130
He couldn’t understand that, he couldn’t 
understand that.

327
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,980
So he went on with very great anger still.

328
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,510
He said, “But must be something!”

329
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,960
Then foolishly one of the Sahaja Yogis, brought 
my shoes down to put in my feet, which I never

330
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,250
asked them, I never asked them, I have never 
ask them, I would not like it.

331
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,840
But they like it because there are vibrations 
in my shoes!

332
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,180
Out of their self-interest that they’re 
doing it.

333
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,010
And he said, “This is the reason why you 
are doing all this!”

334
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,770
I said, “Really?

335
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,520
It’s very wise."

336
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,050
And at that point he left Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,240
So there are such wise people in this world.

338
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,670
I am talking of something very great and the 
wisdom of people is so limited.

339
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,580
The quality of wisdom is poor.

340
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:36,320
They are intelligent, well-educated but quality 
of wisdom is very poor.

341
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,690
But in a village [if] you go, you always find 
villagers more wise than the city people,

342
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,690
I tell you.

343
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,470
The reason is they live with the Mother Earth, 
they take all their innocence.

344
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,230
Without innocence you cannot have wisdom.

345
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,850
Innocence is the basis of wisdom.

346
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:01,309
Normally people who are living in the city 
have to deal with such crooks that part of

347
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,360
the wisdom is lost.

348
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,450
And that’s why the quality of wisdom I find 
is lacking.

349
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:18,640
If that is there, Sahaja Yoga works out, it 
gives you what is your own and you enjoy what

350
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,750
is your own.

351
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,930
Now take a simple question, a simple thing.

352
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:35,670
You have got say for example your property, 
say your ornaments, kept with someone; and

353
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,850
somebody knows the keys and the ornaments.

354
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,410
Say your forefathers have given the key to 
a person and the person comes and says that,

355
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:51,350
“I have got the keys with me, you take it 
and use your own money."

356
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,110
Will you get angry with that person for that?

357
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:00,220
For nothing at all, for giving nothing, will 
you get angry?

358
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,400
But immediately they become like a bull: “No 
we’ll not have it!”

359
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,570
“But why?

360
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,740
Please have!”

361
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,900
I persuade.

362
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,650
“Please have it!

363
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,650
Enjoy it.

364
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,650
It is your own.

365
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,750
You have been desiring it, you have been wanting 
it, please have it."

366
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,381
They say, “Why should we have it?

367
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:21,890
Who are you to give us the key?”

368
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,390
I mean, “But I have it!

369
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,070
What am I to do?”

370
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,050
I am imploring, “Please just have it."

371
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,040
But they are adamant just like bulls you know.

372
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,560
Bulls are easy, easier people.

373
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,230
I tell you, bulls are much easier.

374
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,400
If there is a bull like that in India what 
we do, we take some red chillies and put to

375
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,210
the nose and it will get up.

376
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,330
But what should we do with human beings?

377
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:53,150
They are stuck-up people and this really amazes 
me.

378
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,450
Aren’t you seeking, aren’t you seeking?

379
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,470
What more do you want me to say?

380
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,360
It is impossible.

381
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
I mean I discussed with them I said, “What 
should we do with these people?”

382
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,820
They come, get Realisation, disappear just 
like that!

383
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,730
After ten months they’ll appear, “Mother 
I developed this trouble, that trouble."

384
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,150
But why not?

385
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,350
It’s all free to you.

386
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:23,270
We had in India a great advantage I should 
say because we know what to expect, first

387
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,660
of all.

388
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,610
Everyone knows: whether you go to a villager 
or to an educated man, everyone knows what

389
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,620
to expect, everyone.

390
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,700
Secondly they know how to make out a real 
person.

391
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,960
I mean not the westernised [ones].

392
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,760
The westernised I don’t know but otherwise.

393
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,200
Then also we have a great advantage of certain 
prophesies made in our country so people know

394
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,690
when it is going to happen, how to pin down 
the thing.

395
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,240
Now you too had prophesies made, like a person 
like William Blake.

396
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
But who understands William Blake here?

397
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,580
No one!

398
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,240
Because he is on a different plane and when 
he speaks no one understands him.

399
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,450
So it has all been prophesised that you are 
going to get it, this is going to happen.

400
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:14,309
There’s a book written thousands of years 
back that this is going to happen in 1970,

401
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:19,490
that people are going to get transformation, 
that they are going to get into a system,

402
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,849
a new system will be developed by which they 
will get their Realisation.

403
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:30,429
There will not be any need to go to hospitals 
any more after that.

404
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:33,970
Even the word is there that they will not 
go to any rugunalay (रुग्णालय)

405
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,580
means a hospital.

406
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,730
So clearly it is given thousands of years 
back!

407
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,929
And people are looking forward for that.

408
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,940
But the tragedy is: most of the seekers are 
born in the West.

409
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:52,740
It’s like one has the teeth so he cannot 
get food and the one who has got food, has

410
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,819
no teeth!

411
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:03,460
And that is why Sahaja Yoga takes time to 
develop.

412
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,240
It will always because it’s such a process, 
living process.

413
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,280
And this is the living process of the living 
God which you must ask for.

414
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,319
You must not any more look at things which 
are done artificially: like a baptism, like

415
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:29,079
in Indian communities we’ll have a ceremony 
actually called as a your ‘gopavita’,

416
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,980
where they say that, “Now you are a twice 
born!”

417
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,510
At the age of eight years it is done actually.

418
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,950
Even Muslims do that.

419
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,800
And everybody gets a kind of a thread in India 
to celebrate that: “Now you have become

420
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,519
a Brahmin, you know the Brahma, you are a 
realised-soul."

421
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,690
I mean certified!

422
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,849
They move about like that!

423
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,460
They think that they are realised-souls.

424
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,880
And in America there are many who certify 
themselves as twice born.

425
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,160
[They] certify: self-certificate.

426
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,450
I am surprised.

427
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,920
In this country, I am told that people give 
self-certificate that they are totally mad!

428
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,349
(laughter) I didn’t know.

429
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,269
But really I met some people who came to my 
programme and I said, “Why are you shaking

430
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,269
so much?”

431
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,269
He said, “We are certified mad people."

432
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,269
I said, “What?”

433
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:14,990
“Yes, we are coming from lunatic asylum."

434
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,980
But this type of self-certificate that people 
have, they go about.

435
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,670
And how to tell them?

436
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,839
It’s impossible, you know.

437
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,880
I can understand a drunkard but I can’t 
understand a person in all sanity becoming

438
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,519
so drunk with stupidity.

439
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,559
It’s impossible to understand.

440
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,539
And this is one of the drawbacks, I feel, 
in me, that I don’t know how to convince

441
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:43,410
people that, “Please have it now, this is 
yours, go ahead with it.

442
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,759
You are hungry.

443
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:47,029
This is food for you.

444
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:48,390
Better have it!”

445
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:56,839
And then after Realisation as I said that, 
you are the one who can do it.

446
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:03,489
All the progress later on is completely done 
by you.

447
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:09,329
The complete vidya, the complete technique, 
the Divine technique, how to operate the Divine

448
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:15,109
technique is all told to you and you have 
to just see and work it out.

449
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,750
If you want, you can work it out, anyone.

450
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,779
I have seen people who came to me absolutely 
possessed, absolutely possessed: today they

451
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:25,920
are great Sahaja Yogis.

452
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:38,460
People came mentally absolutely we can call 
them half mad or some of them full mad, certified

453
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,089
mad and they are today great Sahaja Yogis 
giving Realisation to people.

454
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,390
Yes, yes!

455
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:54,650
People who were drunkards, alcoholics, drug 
addicts: all sorts of people came.

456
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:01,359
They all have got Realisation and they are 
settled down as very good Sahaja Yogis.

457
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,470
But how can you treat a person who is stupid?

458
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,999
(laughter) Ego makes you stupid, I tell you.

459
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:17,430
Ego, the result of ego, is stupidity!

460
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,369
People do so many stupid things these days 
that even little children laugh like this,

461
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,839
when they see people doing it.

462
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,130
But to them it is nothing.

463
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,950
They think, “Oh we are very great!”

464
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,180
This ego business is really very blinding.

465
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,249
But one doesn’t have to worry about it because 
Christ Himself has made arrangements that

466
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:44,550
He sucks in your ego.

467
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,999
He does that.

468
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:53,071
Surprisingly the One who came just to do that.

469
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:56,460
I don’t know what a mess they have created 
out of Him, that those who follow have much

470
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,230
more of it.

471
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:07,119
I mean, you see anybody in charge of the church 
he won’t talk to you; he’s a snooty fellow!

472
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,720
You don’t know which way to approach.

473
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,190
He walks with five revolvers around him.

474
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,039
If you say anything, he may hit you or do 
whatever, and you don’t know.

475
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:23,030
It’s easier to face a madman than to face 
a priest sometimes – it’s difficult.

476
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,109
God knows how he will attack you.

477
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:31,539
Today I had a little encounter and I was rather 
worried.

478
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:39,900
But this is what it is: that Christ, a person 
so Divine.

479
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,859
I mean there’s nothing left in Him as a 
person (in Christianity).

480
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:43,859
It’s nothing [of] Divinity.

481
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:48,299
He came on this earth and nicely people have 
cooked him, I really tell you.

482
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:52,809
I mean I don’t know how they could make 
anything out of Him this kind of nonsense.

483
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,590
That this ‘Saint’ Paul of all the persons 
was included in the Bible I was amazed!

484
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:04,099
When I saw the Bible I said, “From where 
does he come?”

485
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:10,319
And now they have started this charismatic 
movement; and go and have a look at them:

486
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,319
they are epileptic.

487
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,569
And horrible things they are doing in the 
name of Christ.

488
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:16,849
Can you imagine?

489
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:23,599
He drove out the spirits from people and here 
the people are calling spirits!

490
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,369
It’s such a mess I tell you!

491
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:32,450
You all have to help me because you are all 
wise people and sensible ones.

492
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:38,770
And we have to see now how many remain in 
Sahaja Yoga; that’s the sign of wisdom according

493
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,510
to me.

494
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,279
Maybe your style may be different, I don’t 
know.

495
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:51,249
But my style, I understand that, if you have 
pure intelligence, pure intelligence which

496
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:55,359
many have, you suddenly know what it is.

497
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,019
As I have seen in Spain one fellow, he was 
a lawyer.

498
00:40:59,019 --> 00:41:07,249
He listened to one of my lectures and sparkled 
him: just sparkled with it.

499
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:08,950
I don’t know what made him think that way.

500
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,609
I don’t know at which point he got up.

501
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:11,720
But he said, “That’s the truth.

502
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,800
I can see clearly this is the truth."

503
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,700
There are many like that.

504
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,190
They may not even get Realisation but rationally 
they just reach the point, “Yes this is

505
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,190
the truth.

506
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,190
Cannot be anything else but the truth."

507
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:32,000
You need not be very well educated for that 
or need not go to any one of these universities.

508
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,229
You could be a very simple housewife to understand.

509
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:41,619
But a person who has common sense which is 
based on wisdom, should know that you have

510
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:42,839
to become your Spirit.

511
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:48,089
All other nonsensical ideas like painting 
your hair, you are not going to go to God,

512
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,089
take it from me.

513
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:55,760
By painting your hair, if you can go to God 
then it is the easiest!

514
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,190
Or by putting nails into your noses or by 
standing on your head, or by jumping morning

515
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:07,920
till evening, or calling God, morning till 
evening: how can you go to God?

516
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,609
Something has to happen within.

517
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:11,240
It’s evolutionary.

518
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,560
It has to be something living.

519
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,920
It’s a living God we are talking about.

520
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,230
Whatever we do before Realisation is all dead, 
and dead way is not going to take you to God.

521
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,200
Only after Realisation because you become 
the master of life, life starts flowing through

522
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,720
you, you can give Realisation to others.

523
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,940
For the first time you start doing really 
something that is living.

524
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,579
You can give vibrations to the flowers, you 
can give vibrations to the trees, you can

525
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:44,250
give vibrations to the nature, whatever you 
touch you vibrate.

526
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:50,380
But first you must become a realised-soul.

527
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,930
And then you respect that Realisation.

528
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,700
It’s a tremendous thing but it happens very 
quickly, very easily and that’s how you

529
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,739
get lost.

530
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:09,680
If somebody is made to work for something 
with a very great difficulty, then perhaps

531
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,700
people realise that, “Oh we must have it!”

532
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:21,319
But if the forefathers have earned quite a 
lot, they want to distribute to their children

533
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:22,759
freely, everything.

534
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:24,940
Why to worry?

535
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:31,470
But we must have wisdom to use that with respect.

536
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:36,050
It has been earned with very great difficulties.

537
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,940
For example the crucifixion of Christ: without 
His crucifixion we could not have had Sahaja

538
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,720
Yoga today, could not have.

539
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,089
Unless and until He’s awakened within us, 
we cannot give Realisation to people whether

540
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,799
you like it or not.

541
00:43:53,799 --> 00:44:00,109
So these people have dedicated themselves 
completely, they have built everything within

542
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:08,319
you and that’s how you get it so easily 
but you must have respect, you must have understanding,

543
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,240
otherwise all their efforts are lost and also 
your seeking is lost.

544
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,640
May God bless you.

545
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,920
I can allow you to ask me a few questions 
but these Caxton Hall people are rather angry

546
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,920
because we have been always going very late.

547
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,920
So I promised that I’ll leave this hall 
by nine fifteen.

548
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
Please ask me questions in an English which 
I understand because I am an old fashion English

549
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,920
knowing woman and I know this modern style 
I don’t understand, so please.

550
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,920
Gavin says I use 150 year old English sometimes.

551
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Yes please?

552
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Seeker: inaudible

553
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Shri Mataji: What’s this?

554
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
What’s wrong?

555
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Seeker: inaudible.

556
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Shri Mataji: Why do you want to do without 
the picture?

557
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
Seeker: Inaudible,

558
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
Shri Mataji: You can’t do it.

559
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
I am sorry.

560
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
Really, you can’t do it in the beginning, 
just can’t do it.

561
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
It’s made like that.

562
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,920
The whole situation is made.

563
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:35,920
Now I must give you a frank thing.

564
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
All right?

565
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
I have not told this to anyone but today I 
must confess to you something.

566
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,920
As I have told you that your forefathers have 
worked it out, all right?

567
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,229
Now in this all working you never recognised 
them, never before.

568
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:45,599
You always refused them.

569
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,640
Leave alone photograph, even bodily you never 
recognised.

570
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,740
You crucified them, you gave them poisons, 
you beat them, did everything.

571
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,990
But in this working you have to recognise 
me.

572
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,150
I am sorry.

573
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,369
This is the first time I am saying this.

574
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,880
Because it was not wise to say but now it’s 
[the] ninth year I am running in this England.

575
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,930
I kept my mouth shut!

576
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:21,599
Of course you can’t crucify me, I think, 
but that’s a fact.

577
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,410
You have to recognise me, otherwise things 
are not going to work out.

578
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:32,869
People want to get their cancers cured free, 
they want to get their Realisation free, everything

579
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:35,920
done free by me.

580
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,289
But my photograph or anything to do with me 
they don’t want to do it.

581
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:41,470
So it’s not possible.

582
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,499
You have to recognise.

583
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:47,460
And Christ has said already about you, very 
clearly.

584
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,729
Because I am something special, I must say.

585
00:45:50,729 --> 00:45:53,210
I am really a special person.

586
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,339
But I don’t want to say that because it’s 
rather embarrassing.

587
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:59,140
But it is so.

588
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,729
Without that do you think I can give mass 
Realisation to people?

589
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:07,569
There must be something about me or not, if 
I am doing it?That’s it.

590
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:12,869
So it is better that you recognise me; it’s 
better for you.

591
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,140
I am not going to take away anything from 
you, nothing whatsoever.

592
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,460
What are you going to give me?

593
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,700
Just think of it.

594
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:25,460
I am here to give you something but you must 
recognise that I am a giver, just recognise.

595
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,940
I am sorry to say but it is so.

596
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,650
You will gradually recognise when you’ll 
have vibrations.

597
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,259
When I say that the vibrations, see how much 
it flows.

598
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,450
When I boast the vibrations flow more!

599
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,430
What can I too do?

600
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,849
But I am very cautious.

601
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,950
Christ said, “I am the light.

602
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:44,950
I am the path."

603
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:45,960
They killed Him.

604
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,650
What did He say?

605
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,119
What did He say so much?

606
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,960
What did He say that people killed Him and 
crucified Him?

607
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,779
And even till today these Jews are not willing 
to accept Christ!

608
00:46:58,779 --> 00:47:02,259
They want to have sufferings, so have it.

609
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:07,880
You will have, not Christ but you will have 
Hitler.

610
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,940
You have to recognise.

611
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,520
This is a compulsion on you.

612
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,430
I am sorry, that’s what it is.

613
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,499
You have to recognise the Divine.

614
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:21,329
You have to recognise.

615
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:23,799
It’s not easy to give Realisation to anyone.

616
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:34,789
If you had seen in Spain I cured a lady whose 
brain was damaged, and they had removed a

617
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:39,059
part of the brain, and in ten minutes that 
lady was cured and she started understanding

618
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,289
everything and she started moving her hand 
and everything.

619
00:47:43,289 --> 00:47:51,279
But for people you know they don’t understand, 
how it happened.

620
00:47:51,279 --> 00:48:00,269
It’s easy for people to understand who know 
what to expect.

621
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:03,420
All the kinds of people have photographs, 
all these gurus have.

622
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,640
What have they done for you?

623
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
What have they done?

624
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,729
They have just taken your money.

625
00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:13,410
This photograph has vibrations.

626
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,140
The first time a photograph has been taken 
actually authentically, thanks to your science.

627
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,289
You don’t have any authentic photograph 
of Christ.

628
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:29,250
I haven’t seen any good picture except for 
I would say a few like Michelangelo or someone

629
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,829
like that, very few: Rubens, Michelangelo.

630
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,380
Otherwise the way they make Him He was never 
like that!

631
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,079
Never, never like that.

632
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,019
No vibrations from them.

633
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:43,349
So I have to tell you there is something about 
me.

634
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:46,670
I am sorry but it is so.

635
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:53,930
It’s rather dangerous to say in this great 
country of yours, where people don’t take

636
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,950
things easily, but you better take it now.

637
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,960
It’s late.

638
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,450
Already eight years I have worked in this 
great country of yours because this is an

639
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,450
important country.

640
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:10,019
You do not know the value of this country; 
you do not know what role it is going to play

641
00:49:10,019 --> 00:49:12,499
for the whole humanity of the world.

642
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:14,039
That’s why I have come here.

643
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:16,999
I have not come as an immigrant at all.

644
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:19,410
My husband got a posting here.

645
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:28,299
He was elected by a hundred and thirty-five 
nations and that’s why I am here.

646
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,410
It’s all organised!

647
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:39,549
And that’s how I am at your service here 
but you have to recognise my services.

648
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:44,619
I have no union for that but you have to understand 
this.

649
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:48,630
If you do not recognise my services nothing 
is going to work out.

650
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,700
I am sorry but that’s how I am made.

651
00:49:51,700 --> 00:50:06,210
Jewish Seeker: (says Something about recognising 
Mother and Christ)

652
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:12,210
Shri Mataji: Because you are all conditioned, 
you are a Jew, you are conditioned.

653
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,589
So you have to get out of this condition.

654
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:18,880
You see you’ll be surprised: you can make 
out a Jew just like that.

655
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,460
When the Kundalini rises She stops at the 
point of Christ.

656
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,650
This is the biggest problem of the Jews.

657
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:25,960
Where are they going to go?

658
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,089
You have to save them.

659
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:30,739
Jewish Seeker: Inaudible

660
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,930
Shri Mataji: This is all your conditioning 
my child.

661
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,231
How can we understand Him?

662
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,630
You tell me.

663
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:38,999
How can you understand Him?

664
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:40,950
You cannot understand Him.

665
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,950
Jews didn’t want to.

666
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,609
You see this is a common practice of human 
beings: they don’t want to recognise, that’s

667
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:49,289
the main thing.

668
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:56,299
Afterwards of course, even the Christians 
so-called who have built big, big churches,

669
00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:57,450
never recognised Him.

670
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,260
At that time, how many were there?

671
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,660
His disciples: useless people!

672
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,779
You ask me, I’ll tell you about them!

673
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:04,779
Absolutely useless!

674
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:10,759
They wouldn’t believe in Him till He got 
His resurrection then they started saying,

675
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:13,519
“Oh God, Oh God!”

676
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:22,599
Otherwise this Mathews, he was a terrible 
man and he wouldn’t recognise that there

677
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:24,089
could be this conception.

678
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:27,780
They can’t understand Divine things.

679
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,780
What have Jews achieved?

680
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
You tell me.

681
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,819
You just see the way they pray: everything 
nonsensical just like Christians, just like

682
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:35,690
Hindus, Muslims, everybody’s just the same.

683
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,930
What are Islams doing?

684
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:44,609
What a ‘sensible’ thing they are doing!

685
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:51,579
It’s a different world I tell you.

686
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:56,519
You will understand yourself when you will 
come to that level and see for yourself.

687
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:02,469
We have many Jews now here sitting down, many 
Jews now; who know [that] while raising the

688
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:06,460
Kundalini you have to take the name of Christ 
and if it is in the stomach you have to take

689
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,549
the name of Moses.

690
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:12,529
You don’t know where Moses is settled down 
and where is that David’s star is, do you

691
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,529
know that?

692
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:14,569
In your being?

693
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:19,200
So what’s the use of all this talking isn’t 
it, when you don’t know where Christ is,

694
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,569
where Moses is, where the star is?

695
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:23,640
You don’t know anything, anything at all 
and what are you fighting about?

696
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,119
But we can show you in the Kundalini.

697
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,170
But be wise and humble.

698
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:37,270
Without humility you cannot go in Sahaja Yoga 
because it’s Divine.

699
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,950
All right?

700
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,339
It’s nothing like clubbing or conditioning.

701
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:45,930
It is something that you really feel, “Your 
hands will speak!”

702
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,040
Christ has said.

703
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,040
You can see.

704
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,220
Even a child can see, yourself.

705
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,289
All right?

706
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:55,289
So do not live with any conditioning because 
you are born a Jew.

707
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:59,930
Supposing you are born a Muslim, take it from 
me, you would have hated yourself! (laughing)

708
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:00,960
Isn’t it?

709
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,999
It’s surprising.

710
00:53:01,999 --> 00:53:06,369
I mean you could have been born in a Muslim 
before.

711
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:08,729
I have seen many like that.

712
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:14,109
With great hatred people are born in the other 
religion and they must have hated one thing

713
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:17,410
in one life and in another life, they are 
hating another.

714
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,609
It’s all hatred.

715
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:24,250
This is not Judaism, this is not Moses, this 
is not that.

716
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,420
It’s very different.

717
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,599
It’s very different.

718
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:41,569
Sahaja Yoga will teach you that they are all 
Brothers and Sisters and Father and Mother

719
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:55,329
and Son and we are just fighting against that 
family which is Divine.

720
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:59,430
You see, what these religions have done is 
that they have put you up [into] conditionings

721
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:04,430
and into ego trips, and these ego trips are 
funny you see.

722
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,950
Every religion has done this, that’s why 
this problem is there.

723
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,869
And these are not a solutions.

724
00:54:09,869 --> 00:54:12,339
If you are a true Christian, then save all 
of them.

725
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:15,299
If you are a true Jew, save all of them.

726
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:17,890
If you are a true Muslim, save all of them.

727
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,859
That’s what it is.

728
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:22,470
And it will happen to you.

729
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:27,579
We have an Algerian who is a Muslim, he came 
down here.

730
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:33,920
They were all supporting fundamentalists and 
the young people got frightened you know.

731
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,210
They thought they should become communists.

732
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,549
And this boy came down in London.

733
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:45,680
When he came here, I don’t know how we found 
him somewhere; he came down to see me and

734
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,839
he got his Realisation and went back and said, 
“No: neither this nor that.

735
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,779
God is in the centre!”

736
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:56,859
And he gave Realisation to so many Muslims 
and they come down here and they worship Christ

737
00:54:56,859 --> 00:55:02,279
they worship Mohammed, they worship all the 
other people, and they know what it is.

738
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:07,089
And even when I went to Paris, so many came 
down to see me from Algeria.

739
00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:14,700
We are entering into Algeria, into Lebanon, 
into Muslim countries.

740
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,349
What about you people?

741
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:24,720
How long are we going to be Christians, Jews 
and Hindus, this, that?

742
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,069
We are human beings and we are prophets now.

743
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:37,539
We have to become prophets and these prophets 
will have powers to make others prophets as

744
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:41,960
prophesised by a great poet in your country, 
William Blake.

745
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,309
That time has come.

746
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,460
You better become prophets!

747
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,460
All right?

748
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,460
Forget it!

749
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,460
Forget it!

750
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,460
You’ll be all right.

751
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,579
Jewish Seeker: Can I come back to you on something?

752
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:56,369
My religion teaches me that we should believe 
in one God.

753
00:55:56,369 --> 00:56:01,349
And I do, I really do.

754
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:04,299
Shri Mataji: But your belief is artificial.

755
00:56:04,299 --> 00:56:06,180
It has no meaning.

756
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,920
Even if you believe in ten Gods, what difference 
does it make?

757
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,269
You see, what I am saying: “I believe!”

758
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:12,269
Supposing, “I believe!”

759
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:13,789
Here it’s very common, “I believe!”

760
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:15,470
But Baba, you believe — so what?

761
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,680
Whom are you obliging?

762
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,069
If you believe, what is the truth behind it?

763
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:21,170
Show us where is God?

764
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,430
You believe in one God I say the…

765
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:28,829
Jewish Seeker: I believe in God and you are 
telling me not to.

766
00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:30,729
Shri Mataji: No, No.

767
00:56:30,729 --> 00:56:33,349
But I am telling you: believe in the truth.

768
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:34,359
All right?

769
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:35,680
So keep your mind open.

770
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,519
If you say, “I believe!” then you are 
closing your mind.

771
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,930
I am saying you believe in the truth.

772
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,529
So keep yourself open.

773
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:46,329
You believe into something because you are 
conditioned into that’s what I am saying.

774
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:50,700
If you believe into anything, you are conditioning 
yourself.

775
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,289
Whatever you have believed into is not the 
truth, if so show us!

776
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:55,289
Simple thing.

777
00:56:55,289 --> 00:57:00,819
Now see, you are a believer of truth, all 
right?

778
00:57:00,819 --> 00:57:07,980
Believe in truth; now you find out the truth 
and see if it is truth or not.

779
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,720
It’s as simple as that.

780
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,469
It’s nothing more or less.

781
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,390
You should be the believer of truth.

782
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:18,729
Not because you are born as Jew, you should 
become a Jew and deny Christ.

783
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:27,279
Only because you are born in a Jew family, 
you are denying Christ.

784
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:29,529
While those born in the Christian families 
will deny Mohammed.

785
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:33,670
But we do not because that’s not the truth.

786
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,630
So you see for yourself, find out for yourself.

787
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,849
As a scientist you must keep your mind open.

788
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:44,459
I want you to expose to the science of God.

789
00:57:44,459 --> 00:57:45,930
All right?

790
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,700
So if you believe into something, then you 
will be sticking on to that.

791
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:53,049
This belief is artificial, it has no proof 
behind it.

792
00:57:53,049 --> 00:57:58,690
But we can prove it that all of them are related 
to each other.

793
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:02,469
You see they have made segments, that’s 
how they have made different religions.

794
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:09,000
If they could put them together, then they 
don’t believe in one religion, do they?

795
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,319
That’s the point.
