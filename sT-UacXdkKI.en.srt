"The Spirit Integrates You" 4th Public Programme

2
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:05,500
September 30th, 1982, Urania, Vienna, Austria

3
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:35,667
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

4
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,583
In my last lectures

5
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:47,125
I’ve been telling you about these centers

6
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:54,917
which are placed in the lower part of the body.

7
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,250
Today I would like to cover the rest of the three centers

8
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:11,291
which lie here, here and here.

9
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:20,875
These are very important centers for human beings.

10
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:28,250
When man as a human being raised his head up,

11
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:33,792
this center established a new dimension.

12
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,750
This center is called as Vishuddhi chakra.

13
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,333
And this has got sixteen petals

14
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,834
which manifests in the sympathetic or

15
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,709
the para-sympathetic nervous system

16
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,625
sixteen plexuses,

17
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:08,917
which looks after our eyes, nose, throat,

18
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,583
and our tongue,

19
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,834
our eyes, part of the eyes,

20
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,125
and the whole expression of the face.

21
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:31,125
When man is ego-oriented, he puts back his head like that.

22
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,959
And when he’s super-ego-oriented,

23
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,417
he puts down his head like that.

24
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:47,917
This center is extremely important for human beings

25
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,917
and for Sahaja Yoga,

26
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,917
because the hands play a big part in Sahaja Yoga.

27
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,375
To get a universal language we have to use our hands -

28
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,959
that is the best, for say, for people who are blind,

29
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,083
who are deaf and dumb, best thing for them is

30
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,667
to use the hands.

31
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,083
So these hands, though we express ourselves by moving

32
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:31,917
fingers and gestures, are still not enlightened.

33
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,291
When this center gets enlightened

34
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:46,625
then these hands become enlightened, too.

35
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,500
This center has two sides,

36
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,625
one on the right and one on the left.

37
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:05,542
The left-side center is caught up when a person feels guilty

38
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:13,250
and obstructs the ascent of the Kundalini.

39
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,500
That’s why I always request all the Western seekers first

40
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:26,709
to say in their hearts, “Mother, I’m not guilty.”

41
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,333
These are the conditionings that have come to us

42
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,208
from so-called religions,

43
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:43,542
from so-called psychologists,

44
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,250
and other people who are responsible for our development

45
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,208
in our childhood.

46
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,959
When material things were very important for the parents,

47
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,875
they all the time shout at children or correct them, saying

48
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,375
that, “Don’t spoil the carpet, don’t spoil that,

49
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,875
don’t spoil that.”

50
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:23,458
And that is how we develop a kind of a guilt within us.

51
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,125
When we grow up in the schools and colleges,

52
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,583
this can be built up very heavily within us, too.

53
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,041
Education has to be imparted to children with great love

54
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:46,166
and understanding.

55
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,999
There’s a big feeling, especially with the people who are

56
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:59,333
very developed that children must be controlled

57
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,834
by brainwashing.

58
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:10,583
But this brainwashing results in this funny trouble called

59
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,166
guilt.

60
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,750
In the same way the psychologists who discuss

61
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:29,625
this subject of guilt are really not understanding the effects

62
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,917
of this kind of a discussion.

63
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:45,208
These psychologists, when they talk about the trouble of guilt,

64
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,625
they do not know that these are pathological cases.

65
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,000
This is not normal, this is abnormal case.

66
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,959
But if you start discussing about these abnormal cases

67
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:01,375
in a general way, it becomes a general disease.

68
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,999
They themselves work with the sick people,

69
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,291
who are possessed, and they have no way of protecting

70
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,917
themselves from these sick people.

71
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:27,917
That is how they themselves become sick.

72
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,166
And then once they develop this sickness within them,

73
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:42,500
they start generating it on a larger areas by saying that

74
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,542
one develops a guilt, and this happens with guilt,

75
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,083
that happens with guilt.

76
00:10:55,208 --> 00:11:00,208
Now God has created human beings in His own image.

77
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,583
There is no need for human beings to feel guilty

78
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,959
for nothing at all.

79
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,834
If these human judges have not been able to find you

80
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,375
as guilty, how can that judge, who is nothing but compassion,

81
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,375
will brand you as guilty?

82
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,417
You have come from amoeba to this stage,

83
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:43,208
and God has created you as the epitome

84
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:47,834
of the whole Creation.

85
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:53,625
And now at this stage you start feeling guilty.

86
00:11:55,166 --> 00:12:00,875
When He wants you to adorn the seat of your Spirit

87
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,417
at this great moment, you are becoming guilty -

88
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,583
just very disappointing,

89
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,917
the whole thing is extremely disappointing.

90
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:26,250
All these evolutionary things have happened within you,

91
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:32,250
not to make you feel guilty.

92
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:38,625
It would be like a prince who is now to be anointed

93
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,667
as a king, suddenly stops - says that

94
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,625
“Oh, I’m guilty, I can’t become the king.”

95
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,250
Self-pity is worse than suicide.

96
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:08,458
So the right-side problem is just the opposite of left side.

97
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:20,166
That is a person who talks with aggressiveness,

98
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,625
who has a personality that he talks in such a way that

99
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:31,208
he impresses people and puts them down.

100
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:38,709
Such a person develops a very harsh and a dry personality.

101
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:44,000
I know of a dentist who came to see Me. He was a dentist,

102
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,500
but he told Me, “Mother, I have lost power to smile even.

103
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,041
I can’t smile now.

104
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:56,375
My muscles do not go into the mood of smiling at all.

105
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,875
I have become so feelingless that I cannot smile - nor cry.” 

106
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,792
So he went to some saint, so-called, and the saint said,

107
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,500
“Oh you have gone beyond everything now.”

108
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,583
This is the wrong idea we have for people who are very

109
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,999
great in spirituality.

110
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:43,291
Such a person has to be an ocean of compassion,

111
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:51,458
ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

112
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,583
Above all,

113
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,792
he should be able to give joy to people and not miseries.

114
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:05,333
Normally wherever I see a painting of a saint or

115
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:12,999
a statue of a saint, he looks the most miserable to Me.

116
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:22,083
Wherever the some artists, architects have carved the popes

117
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,750
and the bishops and all that, they look so miserable

118
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,709
that nobody would like to take their place.

119
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,000
Sometimes with these aggressive people,

120
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,834
as a result of their aggression,

121
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,166
also develop the left side because they feel guilty

122
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,875
the way they have talked to others.

123
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:00,041
With this you develop problems

124
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:06,000
both the sides of the center if they are in imbalance,

125
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,709
you develop a center into such a way that

126
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:14,166
a physical problem called spondylitis can develop.

127
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:24,875
If you feel guilty or if you feel aggressive,

128
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,250
both ways it can work out.

129
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,458
Specially if you feel guilty, then also a heart problem

130
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:41,041
called angina - sort of a thing develops.

131
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:50,417
And also you develop a stiff left hand with that.

132
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,792
Now in short I have told you about the Vishuddhi chakra,

133
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,750
because we have to cover three chakras,

134
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:05,083
and I want to tell you today about the Spirit.

135
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Above that is the center of Agnya.

136
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:25,999
Agnya chakra lies in the region of

137
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,750
pituitary and pineal body.

138
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:44,291
It is placed exactly in the center of optic chiasma.

139
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:51,000
One of the windows of Agnya chakra is shown here

140
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:56,583
on My forehead with this mark,

141
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,959
and another one is at the back of the head.

142
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,834
Now this center is also extremely important because

143
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,417
it controls your ego and super-ego.

144
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:25,208
This is the center where Jesus Christ, our Lord resides.

145
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:34,500
Many priests have been shocked when I told them this.

146
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,125
But His cross is symbolic of this cross where the ego and

147
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,417
super-ego cross each other and are extremely close.

148
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:56,166
This is the place where Christ was to be placed and

149
00:18:56,625 --> 00:19:00,417
bestowed upon, and this was to be accomplished by

150
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,125
His crucifixion so that His subtler body enters into

151
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:08,834
that area of our awareness.

152
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,625
When Christ said on the cross that,

153
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,375
“Now it has been established”  He meant to say that

154
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:30,875
this accomplishment is the establishment of Christ

155
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,875
in that center, which is very,

156
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:39,667
very subtle and difficult to enter into.

157
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:01,625
He was, His body, only His body was made of

158
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:06,291
the vibrations that you feel.

159
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,333
These vibrations are called either Om or

160
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,166
Chaitanya in Sanskrit language.

161
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:29,999
When He is just made of that, He could walk on the water.

162
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,375
The other day somebody told Me that Christ has been

163
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:44,375
born somewhere and now He is going to come on the TV.

164
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,500
So I said, “Better ask Him to walk on the water and then

165
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,999
you’ll find Him.”

166
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,208
Now, this establishment was important,

167
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:05,333
and at the time of crucifixion, when He was in that state,

168
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,917
He said only one sentence, which shows that something

169
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,333
was to be accomplished by His crucifixion. “It”.

170
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,667
“He didn’t say everything is accomplished -

171
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:19,625
He said, “It has been accomplished.” 

172
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,667
He has talked of the future about Holy Ghost, that

173
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,250
everything will be forgiven whatever is done to Him,

174
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:40,999
because done in ignorance,

175
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:47,500
but nothing against the Holy Ghost will be forgiven.

176
00:21:57,709 --> 00:22:00,333
He said, “I’ll send you a counselor,

177
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,375
who’ll explain everything to you.

178
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:09,792
I will send you a redeemer, who’ll redeem you.

179
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:16,291
And a comforter, who will give you comfort.”

180
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,792
The third thing He has said that,

181
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,625
“You are to be born again.”

182
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:37,125
He’s the only one who said this in the whole of Bible,

183
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,250
Moses and all these people, it is He who said that,

184
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,667
“You are to be born again.” 

185
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,166
Because Moses, as I told you the other day, and Abraham

186
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:56,583
were busy establishing your balance in that green part

187
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,500
of the body.

188
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:09,917
But this awakening of Christ within you,

189
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:15,417
the awakening of your power as a second birth

190
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:19,542
was only said by Christ.

191
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:31,250
So we started giving baptism to people.

192
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,709
You get some water from somewhere,

193
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,041
appoint somebody as a clergyman,

194
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:43,750
put on the head of a person and say, “You are baptized.” 

195
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,542
It is such an artificial thing

196
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,750
because there is nothing that has happened,

197
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,999
just you have put some water, anybody can do it.

198
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,792
But to get baptism, you have to raise the Kundalini

199
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,750
to break through.

200
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,709
Christ didn’t say that, “You take water and put on

201
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:20,041
somebody’s head” , did He say so?

202
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:25,625
But a second birth has to take place.

203
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,500
And the second birth,

204
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:32,208
birth itself means an evolutionary process,

205
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:36,417
or you can call it a living process has to take place.

206
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:45,667
In Sanskrit language a bird is called as Dvijaha,

207
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:51,166
and a realized soul also as Dvijaha,

208
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:57,250
means twice-born.

209
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,750
Like a bird is an egg, first of all,

210
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:03,083
then he grows in that eggshell,

211
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,083
and then it matures, it breaks through,

212
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,250
and it comes out as a transformed personality,

213
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:15,500
as something else, absolutely something else from the egg.

214
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:31,667
On the Easter day we give people eggs

215
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,583
to remind them that, "You are egg now and

216
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,291
you have to become the bird.”

217
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,208
But I don’t think people know that,

218
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,291
because resurrection is the message of Christ.

219
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,583
Crucifixion is the accomplishment,

220
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:01,417
but Resurrection is His message.

221
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:16,500
And the way we are making Christ look so miserable

222
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,750
is something I just can’t understand.

223
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,959
They just show the skeleton of Christ hanging

224
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:31,834
with a skin there -

225
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:36,000
can a skeleton carry such a big cross?

226
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,959
Michelangelo was another realized soul who painted Christ

227
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:53,208
like the way He was, a huge person,

228
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:05,834
person who was healthy, full of vigor and joy,

229
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:12,792
and not a miserable pitiable caricature.

230
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,417
I think people who are sadistic enjoy this kind of a thing

231
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,875
to see somebody miserable.

232
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,083
Perhaps that is the reason because just below that I have

233
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,792
seen a miserable looking skeleton

234
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:32,875
put there as Christ on the table.

235
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:53,208
Spiritual life is not misery by any chance.

236
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:04,625
It was a thing of great pride that Christ came on this earth

237
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:13,375
because when He’s awakened within us at this point,

238
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,625
He sucks in the ego and super-ego.

239
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,208
That means He takes away all our conditionings and

240
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:29,750
our actions, the karmas.

241
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,000
That means in the Christian words we can say

242
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:40,125
He sucks away all our sins.

243
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,375
He has died for us.

244
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,375
He has gone through all the miseries.

245
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:54,999
He didn’t leave any misery for us to go through.

246
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:01,999
There is no need for anyone to be miserable now.

247
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:06,041
For example, Jews said that, “Oh we...-

248
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:09,041
they denied Christ and that’s how they said,

249
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,083
"Oh we must have miseries.

250
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,417
We have to suffer."

251
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,417
So they suffered nicely.

252
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,667
When Hitler came in, he made them suffer.

253
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:29,792
That’s what they were thinking was religious life, was that?

254
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,041
And today the same people who suffered

255
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:43,500
have become the other side of it and they are doing all

256
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:49,834
kinds of things without any relation to their religion.

257
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:01,667
Because the greatest of greatest Commandment is,

258
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,999
“Thou shalt not kill” .

259
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,458
And then how do you explain this Christian militia

260
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:19,166
in the name of Christ killing so many helpless people?

261
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,041
Small children,

262
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:31,792
innocent small children, women, for no crime of theirs.

263
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,291
In the name of God, in the name of Christ,

264
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:43,250
in the name of Mohammed, these people are just using

265
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:47,208
their sadism.

266
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,625
Where is the word that is said as love

267
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:03,875
and compassion of God?

268
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,417
Mohammed has talked of Rahamat,

269
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,291
all the time of Rahamat, he calls God Rahim.

270
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,875
Rahamat means compassion,

271
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:16,291
Rahim means the embodiment of compassion.

272
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:27,208
One can’t understand these nations,

273
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,834
what they have done of God and these incarnations,

274
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,375
nobody can explain.

275
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:44,500
Those who followed Buddha, like Japanese and Chinese,

276
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,750
what are they doing?

277
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:54,917
We have some followers of Mahavira, they have become

278
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:59,417
such extreme vegetarians that they try to save mosquitoes

279
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:05,208
and all little worms on the street.

280
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,792
They are so stupid that they make some bugs

281
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:18,667
to suck the blood of a realized soul

282
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:23,458
so that the bugs will get realized.

283
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,125
This absurd vegetarianism - one should understand

284
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:40,999
are we going to give Realization to chickens?

285
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:51,917
We are more kind to animals and to our tables and chairs

286
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:55,917
than to our own children.

287
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,458
Human beings are going in the wrong direction.

288
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,417
The right direction is to be in the center

289
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,625
and watch for the Last Ascent.

290
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,375
And when the Kundalini rises

291
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,709
She takes you through this gate of Christ,

292
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:30,500
through Him alone it takes.

293
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,250
That’s why I said through Him everybody has to pass

294
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,166
into the realm of Kingdom of God,

295
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:40,208
which is the Limbic area within you.

296
00:33:56,667 --> 00:34:02,458
The super-ego and ego represent your past and future.

297
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,875
A thought rises and falls off and another thought rises

298
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,959
and falls off.

299
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:16,500
One is a past, one is a future.

300
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:22,625
Our mind jumps on the cusp of these thoughts.

301
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,999
We have to be in the center of these two thoughts,

302
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:34,000
which is the present, we have to be.

303
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,625
But just by giving lectures and saying,

304
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,750
“Now you be in the center” , you just don’t become.

305
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,125
By giving lectures or giving badges or starting organizations

306
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,834
or having some sort of a postcard with you

307
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,750
attached on your head,

308
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:03,917
you don’t become that.

309
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:16,208
All honest seekers must know that this is all outside,

310
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:21,667
it has nothing to do with inside.

311
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,709
If you are true seekers and know that all these things

312
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,792
are ego-pampering,

313
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:43,542
and is very misleading.

314
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:50,083
It is to be understood in its right perspective,

315
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:56,667
in the proper wisdom of a human being.

316
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:04,000
Now when you cross through your Agnya chakra

317
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:08,625
you become thoughtlessly aware,

318
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:20,542
because you establish your attention in the present.

319
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,625
But again I have to tell you one thing

320
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,417
that this is not a myth,

321
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,625
it is an actualization that has to take place

322
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,750
it has to happen within you.

323
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:45,417
Your awareness has to be enlightened. It is not just saying,

324
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,041
“I am an enlightened being” ,

325
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,667
giving a false certificate to yourself.

326
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,959
Then the Kundalini passes through the last chakra

327
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:04,208
of the Sahasrara, 1000 petals,

328
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:09,999
and opens out into the subtle energy of God,

329
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:14,250
His love and His compassion.

330
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,583
At this time, you are thoughtlessly aware,

331
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:35,250
but you are in complete state of bliss and relaxation.

332
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:47,166
You feel the All-pervading power for the first time

333
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:52,125
as Cool Breeze.

334
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:59,250
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

335
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,417
described in the Koran as “Ruh”,

336
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:11,959
in the Indian scriptures as Chaitanya Lahari,

337
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:18,500
means waves of consciousness.

338
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:25,041
We can put waves of enlightened consciousness.

339
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,458
There are books and books written about it

340
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,625
in Sanskrit language,

341
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:39,625
but they are not translated.

342
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:44,208
Some people who went to India to study Sanskrit,

343
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:53,250
they were only interested in the loopholes of the culture.

344
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:59,166
Like a thief is interested in all the weaknesses of a bank,

345
00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:01,583
they went there to study what they can get

346
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:05,834
to support their weaknesses.

347
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:19,542
In the late 6th century in our country, a big

348
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:26,208
revolt against God broke out as tantrism,

349
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:40,125
where insulting the deity and - unholy behavior

350
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:46,125
became the signs of tantrism.

351
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:54,125
They behaved in such a manner that the -

352
00:39:55,083 --> 00:40:01,834
with the repulsion the deities disappeared.

353
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:07,875
And they created an area around them where they could get

354
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:12,291
all the negative satanic forces to handle.

355
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:22,500
This is called as in Sanskrit language as bhoota vidya,

356
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,583
preta vidya and all that which in short means

357
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:30,875
the knowledge of the cemetry.

358
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,667
Please don’t disturb others.

359
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:50,417
Now this vidya was practiced, this science was practiced

360
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:54,083
by people who wanted to entice and hypnotize people

361
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,750
and make money.

362
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,792
But the people who went there only studied these

363
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:10,417
erotic and dirty things, which has no meaning

364
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,667
to the philosophy there.

365
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:23,542
I went to Nepal twice with My daughters;

366
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:27,792
we never saw anything wrong there.

367
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:35,291
But then one of the Sahaja Yogis told Me the Nepal is filled

368
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:41,500
with these - the erotic images.

369
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,125
I said, “Where are they? I can’t see.”

370
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:58,250
“See there,” he said, “on top of the temple.” 

371
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,500
All these Japanese had their zoom lenses

372
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,583
put up there to see it.

373
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:18,500
They had brought special type of ladders, you see,

374
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,625
special type of ladders to climb up,

375
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:27,709
to take the special photograph of the special brains.

376
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:42,208
And the Nepalis told Me that these stupid people

377
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:48,083
are doing something so unholy and unsanctified.

378
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:59,125
They have no sense of holiness.

379
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:02,125
And I said, “that’s not so.

380
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,250
They have, but they have lost it now,

381
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,083
they can make money out of it.”

382
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,333
But they were surprised, they said,

383
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:18,000
“Who is going to buy these inauspicious things in the house?

384
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,792
They’ll bring all bhoots in the house.”

385
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:33,417
But these tantrikas had convinced these poor artists

386
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:37,000
that you make such statues on top of the temple so

387
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:43,999
so that the goddess of thunder is a virgin,

388
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,999
ans she will never come near this,

389
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:50,792
because it’s so dirty, you see.

390
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:16,417
So, one has to understand that God is purity,

391
00:44:18,999 --> 00:44:21,959
He is sanctity,

392
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:26,834
and He is Holy.

393
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,500
He is Holy.

394
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,542
Now, with this idea, now I’m going to tell you about

395
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:39,333
the holiest and holiest that resides within you,

396
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:49,125
the beauty that is within you,

397
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:54,625
the bliss that resides within you,

398
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:00,834
and the light that watches you.

399
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:06,750
It is your Spirit.

400
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:12,792
It is a reflection of God Almighty in your heart.

401
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:20,709
And the Holy Ghost is the power of God Almighty.

402
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:30,417
God is the witness of the play of the Holy Ghost.

403
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:36,750
Christ’s Mother was Herself an incarnation of that,

404
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:43,709
but it was not mentioned in the Bible because if these

405
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:46,250
Romans or Jews had known that She is the One,

406
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:51,999
they would have cut Her into pieces

407
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:02,375
and attacked Her.

408
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:08,000
So, it was not said because Christ had to play

409
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,999
this drama of crucifixion.

410
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:20,458
But you can find out after your Realization

411
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:23,333
through your vibratory awareness that whatever I’m saying

412
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:28,333
about them is absolute truth.

413
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:36,291
Because your Spirit “which is the Absolute “

414
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:40,500
gives you the absolute answers.

415
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,709
It doesn’t give you relative answers.

416
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:53,834
It takes you out of this relative world.

417
00:46:56,291 --> 00:47:00,583
And you know the absolute through your new awareness,

418
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:04,291
which is vibratory awareness;

419
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:13,792
we can say the sanctified awareness, the holy awareness.

420
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:18,333
When this Kundalini rushes through this point,

421
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:25,000
She enlightens the Spirit,

422
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:30,458
because the seat of the Spirit is here.

423
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:39,291
In our brain, all these seven centers are placed like this.

424
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:46,625
All the seats of the centers are in the brain.

425
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:51,875
So, when the Kundalini comes out of this center,

426
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:57,000
all the centers get integrated,

427
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,625
because the Spirit integrates you.

428
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:11,083
Like in the room, when you have no light you are fighting

429
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:17,166
for different, different places, different, different things.

430
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,417
But when there is light,

431
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,667
you know where you stand with what.

432
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:35,750
So the relativity is dropped out.

433
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,333
But when you become the Spirit,

434
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:47,458
your attention gets enlightened

435
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:52,166
into collective consciousness: it becomes,

436
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:05,291
because this Spirit in you is the collective being.

437
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:12,625
Everybody’s Spirit is connected with each other.

438
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,375
It gives a message which is the collective message.

439
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,125
Now when you place your hands towards yourself and try

440
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:35,750
to find out by putting your aura into a proper bondage,

441
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:40,041
then you can find out about yourself.

442
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:52,125
If it is a physical and a mental imbalance, then the right

443
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:59,125
hand shows on the fingers different centers.

444
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:11,792
And when it is an emotional problem, the left hand shows.

445
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,709
All these vibrations you receive there in sensations

446
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:24,250
are decoded and you can verify everything.

447
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,417
Sitting down here,

448
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:33,750
you can feel the vibrations of any person.

449
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:45,208
The other day I said that Mozart was a born realized.

450
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:53,667
So they said, “How do we know?” 

451
00:50:55,041 --> 00:51:02,667
I said, “Just put your hands and think of Mozart” ,

452
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:09,792
and immediately tremendous vibrations start flowing.

453
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:13,542
When such realized souls play any music

454
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:18,792
or paint any paintings, for a realized personality

455
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:23,166
it is the greatest source of joy -

456
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,041
because you don’t think about it.

457
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:38,375
But the essence of the creator of that joy

458
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,291
becomes one with yours.

459
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:52,458
You feel the bliss flowing in you.

460
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:59,999
And you enjoy it only for joy’s sake

461
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,208
because Spirit is the joy within you.

462
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,792
Spirit is the joy, means it is neither happiness or

463
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:17,000
unhappiness, but it is single thing, is joy.

464
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,417
Happiness comes when your ego is pampered, and

465
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:28,458
unhappiness comes when your super-ego suffers.

466
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:35,667
You get out of the duality of these two and

467
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,625
you become the joy, which is singular,

468
00:52:38,959 --> 00:52:44,000
which is because you become the witness of the play.

469
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:51,125
No more you are in it involved.

470
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,959
Supposing you are in the water,

471
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:04,458
then you have the fear of the drowning,

472
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:09,041
because you see the waves around.

473
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:14,500
But supposing you get into the boat

474
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:21,291
and are established; you are established in the boat

475
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:27,083
then you enjoy the same waves.

476
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:32,125
That is the mastery you have to reach.

477
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:37,083
Another very gross simile I’ll give you,

478
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:41,583
but don’t carry too far with your mind.

479
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
In a car you have a brake and an accelerator.

480
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:04,375
In the same way we have the accelerator and the brake.

481
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:12,667
The human driver tries to balance both of them.

482
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:20,583
Then he becomes the expert driver.

483
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:25,500
Then automatically he drives.

484
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:30,917
Now the master is sitting at the back - that is the Spirit.

485
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,999
Then this expert driver becomes the master and sees

486
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:42,083
the driver in him drive.

487
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:52,000
Now, when you see yourself as a third person,

488
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:56,959
you are not involved in the joke.

489
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:03,583
You must have seen some little children talk like that

490
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,458
in a third person.

491
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:15,166
Like they’ll say, “This John will not go there.”

492
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:20,750
These days there are so many realized souls born in Europe

493
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:26,250
and England, America that we must get Realization

494
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:31,125
to look after them.

495
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:43,792
There are great saints born on this earth.

496
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:51,792
They talk another language of vibratory awareness.

497
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:59,709
If they have a problem, they suck the finger to suggest.

498
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:09,583
Many saints want to be born.

499
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,709
But in the countries where the children are not understood

500
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:19,208
and respected and loved, they avoid it.

501
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:27,959
All the Sahaja Yogis who are married now have got great

502
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:34,583
saints born to them, tremendous people.

503
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:41,291
That is how I would request you, all of you, to know that

504
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:43,750
the time of Resurrection has come,

505
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:48,083
the time of your judgment has come.

506
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,542
That many people who asked Me one more question

507
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,959
all the time that, “What about cleansing ourselves before

508
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:08,000
coming to eat - we are not yet ready.”

509
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:18,792
You don’t have to judge yourself.

510
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,291
You have done all these things in your previous lives,

511
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:26,500
you don’t have to do anymore now.

512
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,125
Apart from this, we have to know that the One who has

513
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,583
created this Universe is much more worried

514
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,667
in saving this creation.

515
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:53,166
All His aspects are busy there to help you out

516
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,834
if He has to save His creation.

517
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:06,458
He has to save human beings.

518
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:10,500
And this blossom time has come where many flowers are

519
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:14,750
going to become fruits.

520
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:24,333
Sahaja Yoga has been there since times immemorial.

521
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:32,375
All those who got Realization got through spontaneity,

522
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,458
there’s no other way out -

523
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:45,458
as every seed gets germinated through its living force.

524
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:51,000
But on the tree of life, there were one or two flowers

525
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:53,291
to begin with.

526
00:58:56,083 --> 00:59:00,417
But today there are many flowers.

527
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:05,625
So it has to be an en-masse happening.

528
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:11,041
Many of you who have been to India with Me have seen

529
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,250
thousands of people getting Realization,

530
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:23,041
because in the villages there are people

531
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:27,166
who are not so complicated.

532
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:36,834
And it will happen to so many people on this earth.

533
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,583
A lady interviewer asked Me,

534
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:45,792
“How will it go to people whom You do not meet?”

535
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:53,208
It is very simple because when I was in Hong Kong,

536
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:57,458
the lady who owned a television asked Me to stand up

537
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,875
and give vibrations to people.

538
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,999
And in that horrible, busy city many people got

539
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:19,709
Realization through television.

540
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:25,000
The science has developed so many things like a camera

541
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:32,333
which can take a photograph and which has the vibrations.

542
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:41,500
There are so many ways we can spread it much faster than

543
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:44,542
Christ could have done it, or anybody could have done it

544
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:48,792
in these Modern times.

545
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:59,208
But it is difficult because it is becoming.

546
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,458
People like a convenient type of a yoga.

547
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,834
If you tell them to stand on their heads they’re happy.

548
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,291
But if you tell them just, “You have to put your hands” ,

549
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:23,291
they just don’t understand.

550
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:29,500
But all the vital things of this world are done so simple,

551
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:33,542
in such a simple manner.

552
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,999
Apart from your evolution, your breathing, your seeing,

553
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:45,291
everything is so simple.

554
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:53,500
It is so vital, so it has to be simple.

555
01:01:55,041 --> 01:02:00,542
So people who like to have lots of mental fits

556
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:06,000
with Sahaja Yoga find it difficult to accept.

557
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,125
I do not say that you close your brains or on the contrary,

558
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:18,834
open it, completely.

559
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:23,625
Logically reach the conclusions,

560
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,667
not blindfolded,

561
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:32,625
not blind faith.

562
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:36,458
But once you have come to logical conclusion,

563
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:40,375
you cannot do with this limited brain

564
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:50,333
because you have to enter into the unlimited.

565
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:58,166
And for that we have to leave this limited behind.

566
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:08,875
But once you get enlightened, everything becomes logical.

567
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:13,542
You can verify everything.

568
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,208
It is so simple, like to the blind people,

569
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,667
we cannot tell about the colors, we can just say,

570
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:26,792
“All right, let the eyes open then you can see.”

571
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:39,750
And that is what is as simple as getting Self-Realization.

572
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:45,625
There is no danger,

573
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:48,792
no problem.

574
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,583
May God bless you all!

575
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:54,208
Today is the last day,

576
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:59,250
and I thank you very much for giving Me this opportunity

577
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,875
to be with you all, such great seekers,

578
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:08,291
and I’m sure next year again I’ll come.

579
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,709
Even if you don’t get your Realization today,

580
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:29,750
you will all get it, we are going to start a center here

581
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:36,375
and we already have a follow-up meeting.

582
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,542
As there is no money involvement you people have to

583
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:54,959
organize it yourself for Vienna, and Austria.

584
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:04,792
And it is your own look-out.

585
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:13,625
But you all can write to Me in London all your problems.

586
01:05:16,999 --> 01:05:18,917
So, may God bless you!

587
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,959
Today is the last day, and if you want,

588
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,917
you can ask questions for about five minutes or so,

589
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:29,750
but better is to get to Realization.

590
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:05,125
You people can come here on the staircase.

591
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:50,959
I think some can come down

592
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:54,792
because there are some more coming in.

593
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,166
Come this side, please.

594
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,875
Don’t stand in the door, come this side.

595
01:08:37,542 --> 01:08:40,999
As I have told you that this is your own.

596
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:44,792
This is your own property.

597
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:56,166
It’s just an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

598
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:05,125
There is no obligation of any kind.

599
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:11,125
As if on My finger is paining, and I rub it,

600
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:14,208
there’s no obligation on My finger.

601
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:19,999
As you are not the other, there is no other for Me.

602
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:25,667
So if I am just pressing My finger and comforting it,

603
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:31,792
there’s no obligation of any kind, I better do it.

604
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:52,125
Now, whatever I just tell you, please listen to Me

605
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:56,125
and cooperate with Me, that’s all.

606
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:06,333
First you must know that you have to have a cheerful

607
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:09,041
temperament.

608
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:13,875
There is nothing to be serious about it nor to be frivolous,

609
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,750
but be cheerful, because you are going to have

610
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:21,375
the last ascent now.

611
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:43,125
Now, you put your hands towards Me in a very relaxed

612
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,959
way, keep them on your lap, but before that

613
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,208
you better take out your shoes,

614
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:52,959
because they are tight and they stop

615
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:58,333
the connection with the Mother Earth.

616
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:28,542
Also you can loosen if there’s something tight in your neck

617
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:32,792
or on your waist, if there’s something very tight,

618
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:35,959
means you should be comfortable.

619
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:47,208
Or if there is any heavy necklace or anything,

620
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:51,208
something that is weighing on the chakras -

621
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,000
because very subtle thing it is.

622
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:13,250
You can take out even your glasses - will be all right.

623
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:31,792
Now everyone has to do it.

624
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:36,875
Those who are not going to do it should go out.

625
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,166
Everyone has to close the eyes.

626
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:47,333
If somebody keeps eyes open, it disturbs the vibrations,

627
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:51,291
so I request you in the interest of everyone be civil and

628
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:54,709
you better go.

629
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You have to be also kind to yourself.

630
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:16,250
Now, please close your eyes.

631
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:26,625
And do not put any pressure of your attention be taken

632
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:31,250
to any place. Just leave it loose.

633
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,417
The concentration and all that is not to be done

634
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:47,375
at all anywhere.

635
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,667
Just leave your attention absolutely loose.

636
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,834
Let it think, let it do what it likes.

637
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:01,750
Don’t put any pressure on it - just now.

638
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:08,625
And now you should know that the left hand of yours

639
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:15,083
is the expression of your power of desire.

640
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,667
And the right hand is the power of action.

641
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:34,959
So we have to use the right hand for the action and left

642
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:41,458
hand is kept towards Me, little stretched out fingers.

643
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:54,417
And keep your hand very relaxed.

644
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:10,041
Now, the right hand, as I’ve told you, that first we have to

645
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:14,250
get rid of this so-called guilt-business from our minds,

646
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:22,000
so it should be put at the left side of your neck -

647
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:25,417
from the front side.

648
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:40,834
But don’t open your eyes and keep the left hand

649
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:45,667
stretched towards Me straight -

650
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:51,041
but on the lap.

651
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:54,417
Now, by putting that you just say,

652
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:59,375
“Mother, I’m not guilty.”

653
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:07,500
Please say it again and again, “Mother, I’m not guilty.”

654
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:17,166
That is important because that is one of the big problems

655
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:21,999
in the Western countries.

656
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:12,375
Now you put your right hand on your heart.

657
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:21,625
And say,

658
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:30,500
with full understanding and with your heart,

659
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:37,333
ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

660
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:43,291
Ask the question three times.

661
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:02,000
On the heart - little higher it is.

662
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:05,917
Heart is little higher, yes.

663
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:10,041
Ask a question thrice.

664
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:14,542
Because you are, but just ask a question.

665
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:44,792
Now please put your right hand on the left side

666
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,917
of your stomach.

667
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:59,041
And ask a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”

668
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:14,959
Say it ten times, please.

669
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:25,875
“Am I my own guru?”  just ask.

670
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:28,917
If you have gurus or anything, if there’s any conditioning,

671
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,709
that will drop out immediately

672
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,959
because you are your guru.

673
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,041
You don’t need any guru at all.

674
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:54,667
When you become the guru, you don’t need the guru at all.

675
01:19:56,999 --> 01:20:00,792
So please ask with full confidence.

676
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:20,999
What’s her name?

677
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:24,000
See, this is the negativity, what is the need?

678
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,250
The wife is not going to be killed here.

679
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:33,166
This is how they attack, you see?

680
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:38,542
Better go now. Tell your husband to behave himself.

681
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:43,875
You can’t disturb, you see. Let her go away.

682
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,792
This is the thing, they are not civil even,

683
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:51,125
they are not civil people. How can they get Realization?

684
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:54,291
Very uncivil.

685
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,792
All right, doesn’t matter.

686
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,625
Forgive, forgive, forgive.

687
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,834
Put your right hand again

688
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:12,667
on the left side of your stomach and say ten times now,

689
01:21:12,999 --> 01:21:16,458
“Mother, I am the guru.”

690
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,583
Now say please again,

691
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:33,792
“My only desire is to become the Spirit.

692
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:45,166
my pure desire is to become the Spirit,

693
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:58,667
to become my own being, to become the Self,

694
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:03,875
to become the Absolute.

695
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:16,417
So let it manifest.” 

696
01:23:46,917 --> 01:23:49,625
Now put the right hand again on your heart

697
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:57,834
and say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.” 

698
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:00,542
Say it with full confidence that you are, believe Me.

699
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:05,125
Put your feet straight on the Mother Earth, touching it

700
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:10,542
straight, you see, don’t push forward your legs.

701
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,542
Those who are sitting on the floor are all right;

702
01:24:17,834 --> 01:24:20,417
they don’t have to worry.

703
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:28,291
So now on the heart you put it and say,

704
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:32,083
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” 

705
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:36,000
Say it twelve times.

706
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,125
Don’t feel guilty.

707
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:18,166
Please, this is the only snag you have, all of you is

708
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,250
that you are feeling guilty while saying it.

709
01:25:20,542 --> 01:25:26,750
Be confident, I’m saying you are the Spirit.

710
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,834
Why do you judge yourself?

711
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:40,875
Let the Divine judge you.

712
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:50,125
So just say -

713
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:04,542
without feeling guilty.

714
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,959
All right, without feeling guilty say that,

715
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:20,041
“If I have done anything wrong, forgive me.” 

716
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,667
You can say this to God,

717
01:26:21,999 --> 01:26:23,750
“Oh God, if I have done anything wrong,

718
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,041
please forgive me.” 

719
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,250
Without feeling guilty,

720
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:31,000
because to take out your guilt I am just saying this.

721
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,583
Better.

722
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:12,500
Better. Still there.

723
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:21,750
Now please put the right hand again on the left shoulder

724
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:25,875
near the neck.

725
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:33,834
And again say, please again say sixteen times now,

726
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,500
“Mother, I’m not guilty.” 

727
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:38,792
Please say it.

728
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:56,291
With no pity towards yourself, but with confidence.

729
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,166
Hm, better.

730
01:28:52,542 --> 01:28:55,792
Now put your right hand

731
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:59,875
on your forehead across and press it.

732
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:12,333
Press the upper line of your hand - across.

733
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,458
And say,

734
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:28,333
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

735
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:03,125
Much better.

736
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:09,208
Now put this hand on top of your head, on the fontanel

737
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:16,709
bone, where it was a soft bone in your childhood,

738
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,458
and try to feel the thickness of your head

739
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:32,417
in the central part of your head,

740
01:30:32,709 --> 01:30:38,000
backwards, forwards, and try to press it.

741
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:46,500
From the base of your hand you can press it,

742
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:51,166
with the base of your hand you can press it.

743
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:05,625
Try to press it, you can do it yourself.

744
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:10,417
With the base, with the base of the hand.

745
01:31:11,709 --> 01:31:14,208
Now, very good.

746
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,166
Now put the hand on top and see if there is

747
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,834
cool breeze coming.

748
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,875
Now you have to say, “Mother, I want my Realization” ,

749
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,166
because I cannot cross your freedom,

750
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,667
you have to ask for it.

751
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:33,542
You can change over your hand.

752
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,208
Put the right hand on your lap towards Me

753
01:32:37,542 --> 01:32:41,834
and the left hand on yourself.

754
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:54,999
Move it up and down to see there is cool breeze blowing.

755
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:12,834
You can go on changing your hand to find out.

756
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:20,542
If there are journalists in this group,

757
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:23,959
I would request them to take their Realization,

758
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:29,250
otherwise they should not publish anything,

759
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:41,208
because you can’t understand Sahaja Yoga without it.

760
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:46,333
It is not a superficial thing.

761
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,375
You have to get your Realization otherwise you will disturb

762
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:59,625
or disudale or you can say, misguide the people,

763
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,792
who are seekers.

764
01:34:17,875 --> 01:34:22,792
Now, better, good. Many are getting it.

765
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:58,625
Now put your both the hands towards Me,

766
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,458
and see if you are getting cool breeze.

767
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:13,250
In your hands, don’t open your eyes,

768
01:35:15,959 --> 01:35:20,542
keep your neck straight.

769
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:55,000
If you are feeling the cool breeze, well and good

770
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:59,542
otherwise also it is perfectly alright,

771
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:01,500
you please the eyes

772
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:06,291
I will tell you how to rise your Kundalini, yourself.

773
01:37:20,999 --> 01:37:23,917
And now you should watch Me without thinking.

774
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,291
Just put your hands like this.
