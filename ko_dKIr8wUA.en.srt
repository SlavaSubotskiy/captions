1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:29,241
This falls on the day of famous great full moon,

2
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:37,408
it is called as Sharada Indu, that's the name of the Goddess also

3
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,867
Sharada Indu; the moon on this autumn season.

4
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:51,199
This is the biggest moon, and - of course not in England,

5
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:59,491
but in India - that day the moon is giving the greatest light,

6
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:08,241
and it's such a great thing that Guru Nanaka was born on such a day.

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,199
As you know in India people celebrate birthdays

8
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,575
according to dates of the moon, called as tithi

9
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:31,575
not as the dates we have here according to the sun.

10
00:01:54,241 --> 00:02:00,617
This great personality was born in Punjab

11
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:08,992
where people were unaware of God's ways.

12
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:26,950
He was always bothered about the Dharma in all his lives,

13
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:31,200
because as you know he was the Primal Master,

14
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:39,491
and the Primal Master is always placed

15
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,992
in looking after our Void,

16
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:49,867
in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master.

17
00:02:50,658 --> 00:03:00,366
And he always took birth either in the most difficult places

18
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,867
like hills and dales and mountains, or they took places --

19
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:12,450
which are even more difficult thing, among the people who were horrid,

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
and who needed their help.

21
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:24,199
So in India, that time somehow Punjab was regarded as the place

22
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:36,992
where people did not respect God or traditional Hindu idols,

23
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:48,909
or you can say the statues that were regarded as the vibrating ones.

24
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:55,200
But they worshipped money (even now)

25
00:03:55,742 --> 00:04:00,825
and they worshipped power.

26
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:12,366
And as at that time there was a King who was very anxious

27
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:15,950
to convert people to Islamic Religion by giving them money,

28
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:20,783
many were taking to Islam.

29
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,575
As a result the Hindus started hating the muslims

30
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,241
and a big hatred developed among Muslims and Hindus.

31
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:41,075
That's how, in those circumstances where there was a quarrel going on

32
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:45,742
between the followers of Mohammad and followers of Hinduism,

33
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:50,533
Mohammad himself took his birth on this earth,

34
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:55,950
though he had decided not to take any more births,

35
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:58,200
he thought that it would solve the problem.

36
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:02,533
Although, this incarnation is such that it never dies.

37
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:16,658
Even if they leave the body, they are always around.

38
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:21,241
And they are the ones who perform lots of miracles

39
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:25,325
when any other incarnation comes on this earth.

40
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,241
They help support and guide the seekers

41
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,117
to go to the incarnations.

42
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:35,617
So, to celebrate his birthday

43
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:44,325
on such a date is also a myth,

44
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:48,199
because he never died. He is eternally living.

45
00:05:48,742 --> 00:05:53,325
They never grow and they never die.

46
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:57,366
But his birth is important,

47
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,909
because symbolically he came on this earth

48
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:10,075
not to propogate any particular type of the void --

49
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:16,825
as Mohammad did or say Moses did, and before that Abraham,

50
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:28,617
Lao Tse, or Socrates - which followed into a religion.

51
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:35,909
But he came to create amity - we can say, to create understanding,

52
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:39,199
to create unity between religions.

53
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:42,783
This was a very big step for Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,034
After that as you know, he was born again - God knows where --

55
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,700
no one knows where he was born, but he appeared as Shirdi Sai Nath.

56
00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:00,909
He too said the same thing, that to talk ill of any religion is a sin.

57
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:14,159
But these efforts are quite lost.

58
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:19,658
Because the people who were Islamic at that time,

59
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:27,325
or those who were Hindus, are now very great fanatics.

60
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:31,783
So instead of them coming closer and loving each other

61
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,783
they have become fanatics.

62
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:46,700
Though we find that Islam is spreading so fast

63
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,658
Sikhism is spreading very fast too.

64
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:56,159
In America there is a horrible guru he has started to spread Sikhism.

65
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,199
He's converting all the white skinned people into Sikhs.

66
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:05,783
They are growing their hair, and they are also growing their beard,

67
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,200
and wearing a kara and all those five things

68
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,159
that were required at the time of Guru Gobind Singh.

69
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,075
When the war had started they had to wear all these things,

70
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,742
which was important.

71
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:26,575
Because war had started and to protect Hinduism or Hindus

72
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,992
from the invasion of the Muslims --

73
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,199
the fanaticism of the Muslims --

74
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:38,783
they took to this kind of a military stuff.

75
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:43,200
Actually if you believe in God - nothing can be killed.

76
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:48,575
But I think that Guru Gobind thought that he had to take it.

77
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:52,909
In all these prophetic religions, if you see, all the prophets

78
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:56,742
who have spread all the religions, they were always attacked so badly

79
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,034
that they had to take to weapons.

80
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,408
Even in Islam they had to take to weapons to protect themselves.

81
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,617
Now when these people took to weapons

82
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:09,283
they had some discipline put on the people.

83
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:14,992
Without the discipline nothing is possible.

84
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,366
And very strict discipline was there for the Sikhs.

85
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:22,241
Now today's Sikhs are no more Sikhs,

86
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:25,241
they are just outside, and inside they are not.

87
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:36,950
I would not describe all the strictness and discipline

88
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:46,408
they had to go through. But every disciple has to go

89
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,742
through a very severe disciplining of himself

90
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:56,117
if he has to become the Guru. There is no doubt about it.

91
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:02,992
It is not that only somebody like Me comes and tells you

92
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,909
do this do that, and next day you forget these things.

93
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,283
It is very serious matter, one has to understand.

94
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,533
You have got your realization through Sahaja Yoga

95
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,450
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis.

96
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:22,159
But still I would say you are not full Sahaja Yogis

97
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,867
because every Sahaja Yogi has to be a Guru

98
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,241
Otherwise he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:33,867
First of all you are Yogis because you got your realisation.

100
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:38,491
But Yogis are of no use, you have to be Sahaja Yogis.

101
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:41,200
So you were told about all the chakras,

102
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:49,366
every thing that you are doing, about all the problems of Kundalini

103
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:52,658
how to cure them. Everything about it was told to you.

104
00:10:52,658 --> 00:11:01,075
Now you became, with that, a different type of a race,

105
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:04,909
a different type of people, who are twice-born,

106
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:10,241
who are born by the Spirit, not by the flesh.

107
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:14,034
Remember that that's a very important point and which John has said.

108
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:18,700
That you are born by the Spirit not by the flesh.

109
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,742
Those who are born by the flesh are in flesh.

110
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:26,617
But if you are born by the Spirit, that's how you are twice born.

111
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:31,742
And when you know all about the Spirit and the Kundalini

112
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,575
then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

113
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:36,950
But unless and until you become Guru,

114
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:40,909
you are not a full Sahaja Yogi.

115
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,283
So to begin with, we must understand that the Spirit is described

116
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:49,617
as a Kala, a a phase of Moon, one phase of moon.

117
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:56,200
But a Guru is described as the full moon - purnima -Guru Purnima.

118
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:00,575
Guru is the full moon, it's not just a phase.

119
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,992
So from one phase you have to go to the stage

120
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,408
where you become a complete Guru.

121
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:14,117
16 phases there are altogether,

122
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:21,241
and you have ro cross the 16 stages to become the Guru.

123
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,450
Now how do we do it?

124
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:28,159
We have to become extremely objective about it.

125
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,992
How do we become the Guru?

126
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,700
Because we have to become Gurus, no doubt.

127
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,117
Now you cannot just say that, Mother you give us a tape

128
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,491
and we'll learn by heart and we'll go on to another person

129
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,366
saying blah blah blah blah blah.

130
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:43,241
Same thing, whetever I've told you, or take my type

131
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:46,159
and show them that this is our Mother,

132
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:51,450
and She's like this and like that. But they will say alright

133
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,658
She may be, but what about you. Sir ?

134
00:12:56,117 --> 00:13:01,658
Now Sahaja Yoga has a 'very' big responsibility,

135
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
which I don't think people understand.

136
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:08,742
I wish they could listen to me very intensely and understand it.

137
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:14,450
So far if you see. Gurus remained Gurus

138
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,533
and no disciples became Gurus.

139
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,700
They were still regarded as disciples of a Guru,

140
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,575
whether it was fake or anything.

141
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:27,199
They never became Gurus themselves.

142
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,825
So there was no need for them to grow,

143
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:34,617
they had to take the name of their Guru alright.

144
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,617
Christ and his disciples, Mohammad Sahib had his own disciples.

145
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,783
Nanaka had his own disciples, Shirdi Sai Nath had his own disciples.

146
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,700
None of them became Gurus.

147
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,241
But now it is in your lot, sorry to say,

148
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,491
that you have to become the Gurus.

149
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,783
It's a privilege, actually.

150
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,491
It's a very great privilege to become the Guru.

151
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,241
And to become the Guru, we must learn what we have to do.

152
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:14,408
This also sometimes becomes just a lecture. I think so.

153
00:14:14,992 --> 00:14:17,742
Because I've already told you on Guru Purnima

154
00:14:17,783 --> 00:14:20,199
what are the 10 attainments we have to have.

155
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:25,825
Today all these 16 stages are to be seen,

156
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:30,992
how we have to grow into a Guru.

157
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:40,700
First is, we have complete discipline put on ourselves.

158
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,825
Like Mr Nick is attacked by everyone.

159
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:50,199
No, you attack yourself. You become Mr Nick now.

160
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:58,783
You have to make this body subservient to you,

161
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,742
that is the first mastery.

162
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,742
The mastery is that my body can sleep anywhere,

163
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,325
it can starve itself, it can live under any circumstances,

164
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,783
it dare not grudge.

165
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:18,700
Anywhere; it should be able to sleep any time,

166
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,909
it should be able to keep awake anytime.

167
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:23,825
This body is to be mastered.

168
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,408
Even if you read 'Ashtanga Yoga'

169
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,992
first thing is mastery over the body, they say.

170
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:33,199
So after realisation the first thing you have to do

171
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,658
is master this body,

172
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,742
and is the most difficult thing for western people;

173
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,533
because the matter is sitting on their Spirit.

174
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:46,950
First the Spirit has to come - first phase --

175
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,700
at least the Spirit has to be there.

176
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:57,159
If you have to be the Spirit then thematter of moon

177
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,575
has to be covered with that light.

178
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:03,491
In the first phase we have to master our body.

179
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,366
So what do we do to master our body ?

180
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:12,034
First of all we must see that what are the things

181
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,617
that drain out our bodily mastery.

182
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,950
We must know all the crooks who try to master us.

183
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:47,825
So I have to first face my body.

184
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:55,742
That first and foremost thing in Sahaja Yoga we learn

185
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,867
that we have to respect our body.

186
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:04,034
This is the first principle of respecting our body.

187
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:07,450
Means indulgence is sinful to the body,

188
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:13,742
because indulgence gives you a body which is no good:

189
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,742
First of all you must respect your body

190
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,992
so that you can master it.

191
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,325
If I do not respect you, I cannot master you.

192
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,491
So to master the body first of all respect your body.

193
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,491
And to respect your body, you must look after your body very well.

194
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,700
But no indulgence.

195
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,491
That doesn't mean that you go and stand in the mud

196
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,950
or rain for hours together or get exposed,

197
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:53,283
to make your body absolutely sort of a abode for all the diseases

198
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,450
and colds and coughs and things like that

199
00:17:55,867 --> 00:18:00,533
so your Mother suffers cleaning your vishuddhi!

200
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:07,283
It's like a horse whose neck is down.

201
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:14,325
So you must look after your body by hot giving it diseases.

202
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,575
Laziness is against it.

203
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:19,909
Persons who are lazy must know

204
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,617
that laziness is against your body.

205
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:26,325
Lazy people who are not bothered to dress up properly,

206
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:30,825
to cover themselves up properly, look after their body properly,

207
00:18:31,241 --> 00:18:38,491
put oil into different screws that they have, to massage themselves.

208
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:41,658
Look after the body, that's the point.

209
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,909
To look after the body you must give some time,

210
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,491
because this body is the temple of God.

211
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,950
And now you have become the temple

212
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:52,617
but if the temple is dirty,

213
00:18:52,658 --> 00:19:01,117
is sick, is unimpressive, is like a stick, or like a balloon,

214
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,450
nobody is going to come near it.

215
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,366
So try to improve your personality,

216
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,825
that it has to be a beautiful temple.

217
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:20,783
I mean, I have given you so many tips, that I think

218
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:24,617
that in my lives' time I have not given so many tips, even as Guru.

219
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:28,783
Because normally people who came to a Guru in those days

220
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,366
were really, really great seekers.

221
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:34,700
They would hang themselves upside down, just to please the Guru,

222
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,075
for months together.

223
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:44,366
So that was a very different quality people -- but one or two.

224
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,533
And when you have quantity quality goes down, I accept.

225
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:52,199
But why not you people take it upon yourselves

226
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,700
that we'll make our quality first class ?

227
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:56,950
So first of all train up your body well.

228
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:02,533
You must take some exercises in the morning, I have told you.

229
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,159
That people sleep after breakfast I am told,

230
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:10,491
I was amazed. I mean, this is too much.

231
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:15,867
You see, God has given you this house as a blessing,

232
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:24,325
to be more alert, to give His light to others.

233
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:32,283
Instead of that if the candle is not even flickering what's the use.

234
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:40,283
So what you have to do is to first of all brush up, yourself, completely.

235
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,700
Make your body alright, alert.

236
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:47,283
Actually at your age one should not sleep

237
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:51,159
for more than six or seven hours, I tell you. No need.

238
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,283
Six or seven hours of deep sleep is sufficient.

239
00:20:57,075 --> 00:21:00,950
I also, in the night I sleep about --

240
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,491
never before eleven sometimes at twelve,

241
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,450
Yesterday we slept at 20'clock, got up at 5. 30 as usual.

242
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:10,533
So how many ? Three and a half hours sleep.

243
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:14,325
And just now I slept for about at the most for half an hour

244
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,034
or an hour or so finished.

245
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:21,450
When you don't have to work, like me,

246
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,325
in the sense that even when I sleep I am working.

247
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:30,241
So to rest your body for such a long time

248
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:32,366
you make your body sit on your head

249
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:37,200
and it will be very very difficult for you to be alert.

250
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,200
So first of all body must be looked after.

251
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,909
There should be no self-indulgence.

252
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:48,200
I mean it can go to any extent of self indulgence.

253
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:51,366
Like people don't keep their rooms clean, their clothes clean,

254
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:55,575
they have no activities - all these nonsensical things,

255
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:58,867
only it is too low, too base to talk about; but it happens.

256
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:02,200
People can go to any base limit - you know,

257
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:03,950
that's the problem, what to do?

258
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,159
On this full moon day one has to realize

259
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:13,700
that on a full moon day you are over-active.

260
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,617
As the moon starts growing the activity starts.

261
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:18,199
In the night also.

262
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:22,491
But none of you so far

263
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,366
are active in the night except for me.

264
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,199
But if you come up you will be surprised,

265
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,575
even in your sleep you will be active.

266
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:38,825
So first and foremost thing is that you must look after your body.

267
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,533
The body should be presentable.

268
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:48,992
And should not go with the so-called fashions of the day.

269
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,533
It is very important.

270
00:22:50,992 --> 00:22:53,950
One should not go with the fashions of the day,

271
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,283
and take to something which is nonsensical,

272
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:02,909
which is not good for your appearance,

273
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:07,199
which makes you look funny or very fashionable

274
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,992
like a dandy person.

275
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:14,783
We have to wear a dress which is in the centre, dignified, which is good.

276
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:25,867
Now I'm told that it is very difficult even to wake up in England.

277
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,950
Somebody had told me, when I was young,

278
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,658
that don't wake up an Englishman.

279
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:37,491
I haven't tried that, even with a barge pole.

280
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:41,742
I just tell you at this time, never in the morning time.

281
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,992
Because I've been warned: never wake up an Englishman,

282
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,283
that is the greatest sin on this earth!

283
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:57,533
So why should the English be so much addicted to sleep!

284
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,075
The whole country is sleeping today.

285
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:05,491
They want more wages, more wages so that they can sleep more.

286
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:11,241
Eat and drink, drink and eat in between, sleep.

287
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:16,658
This is the three - programmed life.

288
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:23,283
It was very difficult, from the very beginnig

289
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:28,491
I saw Sahaja Yogis coming, in that to wake them up was difficult.

290
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:34,283
And these are the same people who were known for punctuality

291
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:38,992
that they won the war at Waterloo because of punctuality,

292
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:45,159
and they were so punctual that people used to set their watches --

293
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:47,992
even in America. They are the same people.

294
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:52,992
Now the other side of it is that they sleep like log of wood.

295
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,159
They used to sleep before also must be, because this is an old saying that.

296
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,950
Don't wake up an Englishman.

297
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:02,992
But I used to think something else about it why it is said,

298
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:05,742
but it is nothing but simple laziness.

299
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,117
So try to see why we sleep so much.

300
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:22,159
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

301
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:27,366
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

302
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:33,867
If the front Agnya is working too much

303
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,783
then people don't sleep.

304
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:42,408
So even if I say, "Don't sleep",

305
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:48,034
it mean that you put your right Agnya in working condition,

306
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:50,034
that means you start thinking.

307
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,825
Which is against Sahaja Yoga again.

308
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:56,034
So it would be left agnya, right agnya, right agnya, left agnya,

309
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,325
left agnya, left agnya, right agnya, left agnya...

310
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,575
It will be going from one to another.

311
00:26:01,658 --> 00:26:10,533
So in the centre you have to be with Christ.

312
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:19,199
He is alert every second of the day;

313
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:28,283
killing; beating, hitting,

314
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:35,867
curing, looking after, guiding.

315
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:45,742
Twenty four hours a day. And go and ask any realized soul

316
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:48,450
who is called as Avadhuta, the one who is a master,

317
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:52,783
they will tell you they hardly sleep for three hours or four hours.

318
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,950
Because they cannot work when they are sleeping,

319
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,700
so they sleep for four hours,

320
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,617
the rest of the time they are working:

321
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:05,617
either they meditate and do things by projection,

322
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,450
or they work with their hands.

323
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,783
They are busy people, they are very busy.

324
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:20,700
You have to be very busy people because now you are employed by God.

325
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:26,575
And you have to do full justice to this employment by working hard.

326
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:33,450
On the contrary you have seen that it is very easy to get lazy.

327
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:44,034
So now, as many of you are already feeling sleepy, put your....

328
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:48,199
First thing should be for all those people who are lazy,

329
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,992
is to put their right to the left seven times -

330
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,366
let's have it.

331
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,575
With the right hand....

332
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:18,199
It's better? Now the back Agnya.

333
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,075
Let's have it.

334
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:29,950
Laziness is first. Shri Krishna was against laziness.

335
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,034
Anywhere he got a chance he talked against laziness, Alasya.

336
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,909
Now watch me.

337
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:41,950
On the photograph you can do the same....

338
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,617
Better now?

339
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:49,199
Tonight we have to keep awake; it's a big problem.

340
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,825
But don't sleep formally here. Alright ?

341
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,867
Informally you can.

342
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,867
Better ?

343
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,658
Put your eyes, try Again.

344
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:54,034
So the mastery should be, first of all, of your body.

345
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,742
Say, you are sleeping on one side, you get a pain --

346
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,950
then what do you do? You sleep on the other side.

347
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:06,825
In the same way, this body is to be made

348
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,533
immune to different shocks,

349
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:13,867
you see. Like you put the watch in the water.

350
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:17,658
You shock it with the water, so it is waterproof.

351
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:21,366
So a Sahaja Yogi has to be an all-proofed person.

352
00:31:23,034 --> 00:31:31,950
So he has no place to complain,

353
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:35,075
because he's supposed to be all-proof, you see.

354
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:38,159
Anybody (Sahaja Yogi) who complains, you can say,

355
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,992
"How are you complaining?

356
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:41,575
Because you have to be all-proof."

357
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:53,159
So no complaints of any kind, of Sahaja Yogis

358
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,575
are to be accepted or sympathized.

359
00:32:01,241 --> 00:32:06,491
If you start accepting people who are complaining type

360
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:09,408
you will be always busy looking after them,

361
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,450
and you will be of no use to Sahaja Yoga.

362
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,992
Those who have habits of complaininig and all that

363
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,117
should go to the hospital and stay there.

364
00:32:21,742 --> 00:32:25,408
Complaining people are really people

365
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,283
who have some sort of possession,

366
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:32,366
I think, that they all the time complain and try to torture you,

367
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,199
and make a nuisance out of themselves.

368
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,199
Such people cannot become Gurus.

369
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:43,034
Imagine - if the Guru is complaining then what is he going to teach?

370
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:44,867
Only complaining.

371
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:48,700
The teachers will be expert in complaining

372
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,950
and the students will be also experts in complaining.

373
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:56,117
So you create a set of complaining disciples, you see,

374
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,533
And when they come to Me what I find

375
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:03,325
they all have double lists than yourselves about their complaints.

376
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,617
But also it is very characteristic.

377
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,867
Like Australians seldom complain,

378
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,159
and if they do complain they are hit also very badly.

379
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,783
Seldom you will find an Australian complaining.

380
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:18,950
I have got letters - except one or two

381
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:22,283
who have now found themselves out - seldom

382
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:27,283
they complain about themselves, about their body comforts,

383
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:30,450
this thing that thing. So under any circumstances

384
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:35,783
those who can live are the people

385
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,742
who have achieved the one sixteenth,

386
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,783
only the one sixteenth.

387
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,742
(Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu)

388
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:47,450
Mother the way you keep it we are willing to stay.

389
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,992
Of course the Mother has kept you very well.

390
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,241
All the luxuries of world Mother has given you.

391
00:33:58,825 --> 00:34:01,575
She doesn't torture you like other Gurus have tortured.

392
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,825
Once and for all.

393
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:07,034
My Son has gone through all the tortures,

394
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:13,200
there is no need to put you to any tortures or troubles.

395
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:15,658
But you should see how your body reacts,

396
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,700
and tell your body, "Yes Mr body, will you please now,

397
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,825
behave yourself and not try to be indulgent."

398
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:32,117
All these indulgences come to us through our senses.

399
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:35,909
So if you can master your body

400
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,408
you will also master your senses.

401
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:49,658
For example the master, or we say the highest of the organs

402
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,241
which controls most of the organs, I personally think, is the tongue.

403
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:58,408
Because it's the primordial nonsense.

404
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:08,034
By tongue we speak things to hurt others.

405
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:13,408
With tongue we learn how to go on jabbering.

406
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:17,867
With tongue we can show how frivolous we are.

407
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,783
Either we are tongue tied or tongue - loose,

408
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:24,700
there's nothing in between with the tongue.

409
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,117
That's only about talking part, that's lower.

410
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:31,159
But when it comes higher, eating;

411
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,199
all the time thinking about eating.

412
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,783
I have told you a hundred times, that Sahaja Yogis should go

413
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:44,283
on really sometimes on absolutely bland boiled horrible food --

414
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:52,700
just to test the tongue. Do it, try this, then try this.

415
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,867
My father used to tell that you must burn your tongue a little bit.

416
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,909
That's one of the tests he said one should do.

417
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,117
But he was a hard taskmaster as a Guru.

418
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,783
So we should see what our tongue can bear,

419
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:09,199
is it fussy about food ?

420
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:19,283
When it sees the food does it start watering, first of all;

421
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:26,491
does it take our attention to food,

422
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:28,992
is food important to us?

423
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:42,034
So the first thing, to overcome the problem of your tongue is

424
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:46,783
"to starve." Starvation is the only way

425
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:50,325
you can correct yourself. You see if you starve yourself --

426
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:56,909
say, morning just have little to eat, reduce it to half.

427
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,783
You'll be surprised your intestine will be halved also.

428
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:02,700
After some time you cannot eat more even if you want to.

429
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:07,700
Your interest will go off. Train up yourself.

430
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,742
Starvation is a very good thing.

431
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:13,241
I think 40 days that Christ did is a very good idea.

432
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:20,783
But that should not be a kind of a thing that like - they have Ramazan,

433
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:26,867
that they eat the most s..... food during that time early in the morning

434
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,283
then the whole day they starve - thinking about food!

435
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:38,575
Starve yourself fully and don't think about food.

436
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:40,825
That's difficult so starve yourself  in halfway

437
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,700
and dont think about food.

438
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,909
Gradually try to master your tongue.

439
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:51,241
Mastery of your tongue is only possible if you know

440
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:54,450
how to starve your day. This is for the western side.

441
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:58,491
For eastern side they fast morning till evening.

442
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:02,117
I know one lady, if you ask them they say

443
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,200
"I observe Monday, I observe Tuesday, I observe Wednesday,

444
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:09,825
I observe Thursday, I observe Friday a fast,

445
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:16,075
and perhaps maybe if I do not starve Saturday I will eat on Sunday."

446
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:20,200
I have know such people in my life time - many --

447
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:22,909
who just go on fasting.

448
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:25,034
They are such experts and astute? you see,

449
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:29,575
that they can show you that they can fast for 50 days, 80 days,

450
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:33,617
108 days, and 300 days.

451
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:36,200
Starving masters.

452
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,450
So for them I have to tell, "you have to eat'', when they are starve.

453
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:42,075
To you I have to say,

454
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,742
"Let us see which day we can starve ourselves."

455
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:52,199
Let us have one day to celebrate today's great day of Nanaka!

456
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,867
One day let us starve. Which day should we?

457
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:02,950
Monday we cannot because Monday we have a programme,

458
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:10,117
Tuesday we cannot because it is a day when Hanuman has to work,

459
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,825
Wednesday we cannot, because then the creativity takes place,

460
00:39:18,408 --> 00:39:21,700
Thursday we cannot because we are Guru at that day,

461
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,950
we have to work very hard as Gurus, Friday we cannot,

462
00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:27,117
we have to work the shakti of Mother,

463
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,617
Saturday we cannot because we have to do

464
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,491
all the intrigue of Shri Krishna.

465
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,408
And Sunday how can it be, this is the day of the sun!"

466
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:44,199
So which is the best day for starving, now let us see.

467
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:51,658
We should have Thursday, because Thursday is the Guru's day

468
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:56,658
and let us do some fasting, half day, half day can we?

469
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,909
Can we start with half day then f... day?

470
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:02,909
Thursday let us have, maybe second half

471
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:05,283
because breakfast is essential I think.

472
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,617
Without breakfast you see, the horses cannot whinny,

473
00:40:12,283 --> 00:40:14,366
so let us have the second half

474
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:20,117
or we can have the first half.

475
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:26,491
Actually you have to discipline yourself, if you have to be the Gurus.

476
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:29,283
It's like going to a college,

477
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:31,325
when you are left to yourself,

478
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:34,241
it is you, who has to discipline yourself,

479
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:37,199
nobody has to tell you that you do this and do that

480
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,408
That's the measure to wake you up.

481
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,491
In India it is the other way around.

482
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,825
If you tell somebody that you have to wake up at 5,

483
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:51,867
the person who has told you will be awakened at 4 o' clock himself,

484
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:56,200
the one who has told; so that he doesn't get up to wake him up.

485
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,700
Did you follow me?

486
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:01,950
And the whole house will be awakened at 4 o'clock

487
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:05,325
so that they can take up the duty from the person

488
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:06,825
who has to get awakened.

489
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,950
But the fellow who has to awaken

490
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,658
might not sleep the whole night.

491
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:17,075
It is just the other way round, the other extreme of it.

492
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:23,825
Say if I am there, one night I sleep there. If I get up

493
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:27,575
at one o'clock I find all of them sitting and meditating,

494
00:41:27,575 --> 00:41:30,199
in the passage, up to the bathroom everywhere.

495
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,241
They have not gone home, not taken food, nothing.

496
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,283
Just meditating, taking vibrations, correcting.

497
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:37,950
I am sleeping inside.

498
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,199
In the night I want to go to the bathroom,

499
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,325
I just cannot go because they are all meditating.

500
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,533
Nobody is sleeping, nobody is sleeping.

501
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,241
So it is the other way around.

502
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,867
So to you people let us do one day.

503
00:41:56,867 --> 00:42:02,199
That you must have one day fasting, one day keeping, one awake.

504
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:05,283
Which day should it be? Let's see.

505
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:10,867
A day when there is no film!

506
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:25,909
Half night, second half I mean, not the first half.

507
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:41,200
Which day? Which is the most difficult day when you cannot,

508
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:51,034
cannot keep awake. Sunday night;

509
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:54,658
but there's a fiIm on!

510
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,700
Without the film, you see!

511
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,783
Treat yourself like that, joke with yourself,

512
00:43:03,783 --> 00:43:06,617
now Sunday night is there a film on?

513
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:08,283
After 12 there isn't.

514
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:10,658
So Sunday night you get up at 12 o'clock.

515
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:17,992
Let's have it. Enjoy it. Don't get angry.

516
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:22,159
Make a fun out of it.

517
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:29,199
You think more about it, then you get upset.

518
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,241
You just don't think about it, then you'll enjoy it.

519
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,783
It's like swimming.

520
00:43:32,825 --> 00:43:37,325
Get up at 12 o'clock, all of you, go for a bath, sit down,

521
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:41,034
sing Bhajans, this, that, let us do it. Should we ?

522
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:48,742
Michel, What happen with you?

523
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:55,241
"I can go to bed at two o clock"

524
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,159
You have to get up at 12 o'clock,

525
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:03,200
you have to go to bed till 12 o'clock.

526
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,200
Get up at 12 o'clock.

527
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:09,199
You see the first half of the night, one must sleep always, it's better.

528
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:13,700
Second half of the night is the better part, alright?

529
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:17,075
So the first half of the night you all have to sleep, anytime.

530
00:44:17,117 --> 00:44:20,200
You can sleep about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock if you want to.

531
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:25,950
But that should not be important, what time you sleep,

532
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,075
you have to get up at 12 o'clock in the morning,

533
00:44:29,742 --> 00:44:31,909
or say after 12.

534
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:38,867
Shri Krishna was born in the night about 12 o'clock.

535
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:41,075
Nanaka was born 12 o'clock in the night.

536
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:45,283
All the Gurus mostly took their birth at 12 o'clock in the night.

537
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:51,742
To celebrate that, we must have one day when we do not sleep after 12.

538
00:44:52,408 --> 00:44:56,199
But then what about Caxton Hall!

539
00:44:56,658 --> 00:44:59,742
"Mother we can try this on Saturday.

540
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,325
¿What?

541
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:04,450
¿Can we do it in Saturday night? It will be more safe

542
00:45:04,783 --> 00:45:07,450
because will be less incidents the Sunday that Monday"

543
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:15,117
Alright so you can sleep in the day time of Saturday or of Sunday.

544
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,325
Sunday afternoon you can sleep.

545
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:19,658
No, no, no that won't be alright.

546
00:45:22,491 --> 00:45:25,075
If you make any compensation

547
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:27,783
then you are not torturing your body much!

548
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,283
You must devise a method by which

549
00:45:32,325 --> 00:45:35,408
your body does see that it has to get up at 12 o'clock,

550
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,825
Better keep it that time.

551
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,199
What do you think ? Alright.

552
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,408
"¿Do you think that this may affect the job on Monday?"

553
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,491
¿What he said?

554
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:47,700
"That the job of the people may be affected

555
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,283
on Monday morning, Mother".

556
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:54,742
They will never, take it from me, they will not:

557
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:57,199
You see work is not important what is important

558
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,700
is your Spirit, your mastery.

559
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:06,241
Work, in any case you're not going to have after some time,

560
00:46:06,992 --> 00:46:09,241
so that work is not important.

561
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:12,533
This new work that you have taken, better look after that.

562
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:16,533
Forget about your work. Forget about these things.

563
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:19,159
What is important is your Spirit.

564
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,408
Otherwise you cannot become Gurus.

565
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,199
Spirit is the most important thing.

566
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,867
The rest of the things are absolutely unimportant,

567
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:29,783
a zero.

568
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:37,408
I've been very slowly trying to take you out

569
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,867
of the mud of materialism and of these mundane things.

570
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:47,491
But you have to work for God. You are special people.

571
00:46:49,034 --> 00:46:53,450
So, you have to make yourself a master,

572
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:00,491
so God gives you all the blessings, everything.

573
00:47:01,491 --> 00:47:04,909
But the idea of luxurious life must be given up.

574
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:09,117
People want to make this life luxurious,

575
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:12,408
then you'll have the luxury of this world

576
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,533
but not the luxury of God's blessings.

577
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,159
One of the two you have to select.

578
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:31,909
Either you lead a life which is luxurious on the material level,

579
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:35,909
or you lead a luxurious life of God's blessings.

580
00:47:35,909 --> 00:47:38,783
One of the two you have to choose, the time has come.

581
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:42,742
So nothing is important you see,

582
00:47:42,742 --> 00:47:46,117
the insecurity of money also is another nonsense.

583
00:47:46,117 --> 00:47:48,325
At least you people should not have it.

584
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,742
I mean you will never starve at least,

585
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:55,117
but Indians if they do not work they will starve.

586
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,617
But you people can never starve, if you are unemployed,

587
00:48:00,617 --> 00:48:06,075
government is happy more, as long as you don't bother them.

588
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,658
If you sit at home and meditate

589
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,117
they'll be very happy.

590
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,617
So to earn more money or to make more money

591
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:19,825
is not important at all in Sahaja Yoga.

592
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:24,742
Most important thing is to be the Spirit.

593
00:48:24,783 --> 00:48:26,992
For that whatever is to be done has to be done.

594
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,491
Let everything suffer, you don't make your Spirit suffer.

595
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:44,617
Because you have to become the full moon, like Guru Nanak.

596
00:48:45,283 --> 00:48:48,491
How much did Guru Nanak earn?

597
00:48:53,742 --> 00:49:01,034
You should find out, how did he live his life ?

598
00:49:06,825 --> 00:49:12,034
There is nothing to bother about money,

599
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,075
because more money is not needed.

600
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,199
Just needed for your food and your living.

601
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,658
And then money is arranged if you need

602
00:49:27,658 --> 00:49:29,700
any extra money sometimes, emergencies.

603
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:32,283
I've done it for many Australians, you know.

604
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,742
But those are the people who have dedicated themselves fully.

605
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,283
And that is why they have been helped,

606
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:43,783
whenever there is an emergency they don't have to bother.

607
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:49,241
But the dedication to your Spirit has to be full, complete,

608
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:53,366
and nothing to your work, actually.

609
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:56,783
Because that goes hand in hand.

610
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:02,034
If you are not worried about yourself after realisation,

611
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,283
about your Spirit, you'll have all the problems of the world.

612
00:50:07,867 --> 00:50:10,117
First and foremost is financial problems.

613
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:25,199
Then, physical problem, mental problem, emotional problem.

614
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:27,867
All kinds of problems will follow,

615
00:50:27,909 --> 00:50:31,909
because I've awakened your Kundalini; one part I've done.

616
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:35,533
But another part that is your heart, you have not opened.

617
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,867
You must give your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

618
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:40,491
You have not opened your heart as yet.

619
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,117
Heart has to be opened.

620
00:50:44,617 --> 00:50:47,075
You are still woried about your father, mother,

621
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:48,950
brother, sister, wife, children.

622
00:50:49,658 --> 00:50:56,034
Open your heart fully to Sahaja Yoga.

623
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:58,658
In a doubtless way.

624
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,658
Then only doubt less awareness will settle down.

625
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:05,034
Unless and until you open your heart,

626
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,325
Kundalini rising has no meaning.

627
00:51:07,909 --> 00:51:12,408
Because the Kundalini is rising but the heart has not opened.

628
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:17,117
If the Mother Earth sends forth her power through the seed

629
00:51:17,117 --> 00:51:20,199
and the seed doesn't open, then what's the use ?

630
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:21,950
It's all a myth.

631
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,199
Open your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

632
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:27,117
Open your heart to Spirit, and say,

633
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,075
"Mother we are the Spirit."

634
00:51:31,117 --> 00:51:32,700
You have to realize this,

635
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:34,783
many people also perhaps do no realize

636
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,575
that you have come on this earth to be the Spirit

637
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:41,867
and not to be workers of human beings.

638
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:49,408
You must understand your greatness and know

639
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:53,450
that you are not like mundan people. That's why you are blessed.

640
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,742
Who is blessed so much ?

641
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:59,117
You are described long time back by Blake,

642
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,408
that such and such people are going to come on this earth

643
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,825
"men of God." Men of God.

644
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:09,742
What do you have in your heart?

645
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:14,992
Your heart will be like a stone.

646
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:18,450
Unless and until there is light of the Spirit

647
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,867
it is a stone heart,

648
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:28,825
and this stone is going to hurt everyone, is going to ruin you completely.

649
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:33,366
Open your heart hundred percent.

650
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:41,034
You have met Indian Sahaja Yogis,

651
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,742
they have problems of money.

652
00:52:44,742 --> 00:52:47,700
And how much they work for Sahaja Yoga,

653
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,825
day in and day out how much they have contributed for Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:59,199
You can imagine, about 7 lakhs of rupees they have collected,

655
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:06,658
Rustom knows. 7 lakhs of rupees, they have collected for their ashram.

656
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:16,325
7 lakhs is about £35000.£ 35000 they have collected only in Bombay.

657
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:20,992
In Delhi they have collected about 5 lakhs, £ 25000.

658
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,742
They are working, they have families they have children,

659
00:53:27,283 --> 00:53:30,867
but what they think about is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

660
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:32,909
nothing but Sahaja Yoga, nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

661
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:42,783
They give most of their money for Sahaja Yoga, I think.

662
00:53:43,617 --> 00:53:45,366
They live with minimum.

663
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:50,117
If I tell them why don't you buy another shirt for yourself,

664
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:56,575
they will say, "Mother, I have worn lots of shirts in my previous life,"

665
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,950
So satisfied ! "We have found the Atma now,

666
00:54:02,992 --> 00:54:05,325
let us dress up the Atma.

667
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:09,491
We have found out our heart, let us become the heart".

668
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:11,950
What is the need to worry about these things ?

669
00:54:11,992 --> 00:54:14,241
We have done enough of all this nonsense.

670
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:19,491
I tell you they will think they are poor, but they are not.

671
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,783
Wherever they can save their money they will save it.

672
00:54:24,283 --> 00:54:26,783
They used to give me some money before, I said,

673
00:54:26,825 --> 00:54:28,950
"No I don't need just now, there's no need"

674
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,867
They said I have no place to keep;

675
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:33,034
there is no trust, nothing, how are we to do it?

676
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:43,533
They continued like this till about, I think, in, 74,

677
00:54:47,825 --> 00:54:51,283
when I went back we thought of starting an ashram,

678
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:53,867
because you people were all coming there.

679
00:54:55,909 --> 00:55:01,617
So I said alright, now you have to give me money,

680
00:55:01,658 --> 00:55:04,783
all the Sahaja Yogis can give me money, whatever they have saved.

681
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:08,325
And you'll be amazed everyone came out with 1000 rupees,

682
00:55:08,366 --> 00:55:13,533
every one of them, whether he was a labourer or every one of them,

683
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:18,075
1000 rupees minimum. Up to 21 000.

684
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:22,034
In 3 years time they had saved,

685
00:55:22,075 --> 00:55:23,950
because they thought it is our responsibility

686
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:25,575
to save money for Sahaja Yoga.

687
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,992
Tomorrow if we have to have an ashram how are we going to have ?

688
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,950
But we still indulge into things.

689
00:55:43,742 --> 00:55:48,075
So this is what is the Gurupada.

690
00:55:48,117 --> 00:55:53,992
This Sir has to sit down, make an space for him.

691
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:57,575
Come on, please. He doesn't need to be stand up. All right.

692
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,366
So today is such a great day of Guru Nanaka's birthday,

693
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:10,491
and we have to see his own life, how he spent his own life,

694
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:16,992
how he lived and in what conditions he managed.

695
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,034
So the first thing is to look after, disciplining yourself,

696
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:28,283
feeling responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

697
00:56:29,117 --> 00:56:33,075
I was amazed people told, me that in the ashram

698
00:56:33,117 --> 00:56:38,199
people keep the lights on, and the oil costs so much,

699
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,159
300 pounds every week. I'm amazed!

700
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:48,700
Every one of you should be responsi-be for every electricity,

701
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,408
everything that you spend here. This is God's place.

702
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:00,325
Somebody has given the car, everybody wants to use the car.

703
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:02,658
You see this saving the pounds

704
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,117
is still going on the heads of Sahaja Yogis.

705
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,117
If they can save by taking somebody's car they would borrow.

706
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,575
Never borrow anybody's car.

707
00:57:10,575 --> 00:57:12,950
It's not for you, you must have your self respect,

708
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,617
why to borrow anybody's car?

709
00:57:14,617 --> 00:57:16,992
It's not to be done.

710
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,034
So the second point of the Self is self respect.

711
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:27,783
First is the respect of your body,

712
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:30,867
and the second is self-respect.

713
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,825
We are arrogant, we can be rude,

714
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,491
but we have no self respect.

715
00:57:51,617 --> 00:57:54,783
But it is the training that is lacking,

716
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,783
you see suddenly I find after war

717
00:57:57,783 --> 00:58:03,992
there has been no teaching how to be self respecting.

718
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:11,408
Like in the war, might be, the atmosphere might have been created I don't know why - that-

719
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:14,117
"I´m above everything, don't care for others."

720
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:20,199
May have been; I don't know why this kind of a thing has come,

721
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,325
but it is so. Very prevalent.

722
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,783
But you people have to be other way round:

723
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:28,700
'Others are first and then yourself.

724
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,325
With your self respect.

725
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:33,658
Doesn't matter, nobody is going to die, I can tell you this much.

726
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:45,366
You all must have self respect; and such mediocre people

727
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:48,491
should not be allowed to stay in Sahaja Yoga,

728
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,325
at least in the ashram, because it brings a bad name to all Sahaja Yoga.

729
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:58,450
One person can spoil the whole.

730
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:03,283
Only people who want to be Gurus have to stay in the ashram.

731
00:59:03,325 --> 00:59:06,117
It's not going to be made a convenience for anyone.

732
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:12,199
But the other way around is that,

733
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,825
"We are going to look after ourselves,

734
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,950
we have to become this, we have to grow,

735
00:59:17,992 --> 00:59:19,658
we have to do it."

736
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,159
Then it's just, the other way round, everything works out,

737
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,034
I don't have to tell you.

738
00:59:31,075 --> 00:59:33,408
You know this is so base and so gross

739
00:59:33,867 --> 00:59:35,783
that after being here for so many years,

740
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:41,199
you should all have become avadhutas by now, absolutely.

741
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:43,700
Controlling all elements, everything, should have been possible;

742
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:46,950
but stilI you are under the grip of the elements,

743
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,366
how can you control it ?

744
00:59:56,325 --> 01:00:01,159
First of all get out of the slavery, this mental slavery.

745
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:07,575
"Alright if it is there, it is there, if it is not there it doesn't matter.

746
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:09,450
Nothing is more important than me,

747
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,575
I am the king of the whole world.

748
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:13,742
If I have to sleep on the ground I can sleep,

749
01:00:13,742 --> 01:00:15,700
if I have to sleep in the palaces I can sleep,

750
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,575
nothing can dominate me." Then you are the master.

751
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:23,867
You know in India, there are some Sahaja Yogis

752
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:29,450
who are controlling definitely controlling, elements.

753
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:33,408
We have examples of that, lots of things have been published

754
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,199
you know in Nirmala Yoga, you must have heard.

755
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:39,200
But you meet them, you'll find they are avadhutas

756
01:00:39,241 --> 01:00:41,825
and when they talk you feel a great sage is talking,

757
01:00:41,867 --> 01:00:44,491
and the way they behave, all the time you see their behaviour

758
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:46,117
and everything is so great.

759
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:47,825
We need people of that calibre today,

760
01:00:47,867 --> 01:00:50,533
because that is the situation of all nations.

761
01:00:53,867 --> 01:00:58,159
You have to be extra-good, because today is not a time

762
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,325
when we can allow things to go, as they are.

763
01:01:05,617 --> 01:01:08,159
Or we are not just disciples,

764
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,034
we all have to become gurus.

765
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:17,408
And it is not the time when you can play with time.

766
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:23,491
You cannot play with evil. You have to surmount it.

767
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,325
You have to come on top of it, it is the time

768
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:28,075
when the whole ship is going to be drowned or saved.

769
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:29,783
This is the situation today.

770
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:33,491
And that's why you have got your realization from God.

771
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,325
If that precarious time had not arrived,

772
01:01:36,366 --> 01:01:39,366
how many of you really think you deserved it?

773
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:45,742
But you got it, because the time is such that everybody

774
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:49,366
must be given realization, and they must be given all powers

775
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:51,200
so that they come up.

776
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,117
But if you do not open your heart,

777
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:55,491
put all your attention to your Spirit,

778
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,700
these powers will not work out.

779
01:01:57,742 --> 01:01:59,742
None of these powers will work out in you.

780
01:02:00,575 --> 01:02:02,867
This is the problem.

781
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:05,992
Every Guru had a command on the elements.

782
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:08,909
Nanaka, you know definitely.

783
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:15,366
People were sitting there and they asked him for the water

784
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:21,533
and he put his hand on a rock and the water started pouring down.

785
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:26,199
That's why it is called Punjab, Punja :

786
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:31,658
five; and the five rivers exist there, too.

787
01:02:35,617 --> 01:02:40,200
It is said about all of them that they had powers over the elements.

788
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,159
So how much we are lacking ?

789
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:50,575
Still we are like other people who are selling cheap things,

790
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:59,575
or who are busy making cheap things, or who are of no value.

791
01:03:00,283 --> 01:03:02,825
You are the ones who have to save the whole world.

792
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:08,575
And the maximum of my life, blood and toil and everything,

793
01:03:08,617 --> 01:03:10,950
sweat, I've put in this land of yours.

794
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:13,617
And the time is coming for me to go.

795
01:03:14,117 --> 01:03:19,783
Only three years more are left; before that,

796
01:03:19,825 --> 01:03:22,199
I hope, we establish an ashram.

797
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:23,825
We need not pay for it,

798
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:28,075
but, you have to be ready to occupy it,

799
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:30,117
otherwise you cannot occupy it I can tell you,

800
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:32,450
you cannot get any more blessings of God.

801
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:35,241
So why should God bless you ?

802
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:37,117
This is the point one should ask oneself.

803
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:42,700
Are you your own Spirit or you are all else but the Spirit!

804
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:49,909
But when I say something, it just goes as a big roaring,

805
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,034
I don't know if the frequency has reached your ears or not,

806
01:03:54,075 --> 01:03:56,950
but I would request you now,

807
01:03:56,992 --> 01:04:00,575
as Gavin has asked me for Guru Nanaka's day,

808
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,199
I really didn't want to come.

809
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:05,450
Because to talk of Guru Nanaka and to hear about him,

810
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:10,199
one has to be a very great person.

811
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:19,241
Because such a light to bear, you have to make up yourself.

812
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:22,034
Everything else is important,

813
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:30,366
then how can you talk of Sahaja Yoga coming there.

814
01:04:33,992 --> 01:04:36,034
I went to America, I was surprised!

815
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:37,909
Americans whatever it is, few people,

816
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:40,366
but to them Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing.

817
01:04:40,408 --> 01:04:43,034
They talk of nothing but Sahaja Yoga, their life is Sahaja Yoga,

818
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:45,783
morning till evening they are working out Sahaja Yoga,

819
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:48,783
nothing else, they are not bothered.

820
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:50,617
Australians you know.

821
01:04:56,075 --> 01:05:04,241
But the Heart is not open, the Spirit has not shown its light.

822
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:12,992
It is the one that gives you complete satisfaction, complete joy,

823
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:18,075
complete Guru's principle, because then you start giving.

824
01:05:18,117 --> 01:05:20,491
If there is no light what are you giving? Darkness ?

825
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:24,617
What are you giving to others ?

826
01:05:25,366 --> 01:05:29,408
The darkness that is within you, if you are going to give that....

827
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:44,159
So the second phase, has to be, as I have told you, to have self respect.

828
01:05:45,034 --> 01:05:48,366
-

829
01:05:48,408 --> 01:05:51,909

-

893
01:10:48,617 --> 01:10:51,742
-

894
01:10:55,617 --> 01:11:00,283

898
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:21,783
-

899
01:11:21,825 --> 01:11:24,783
-

900
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:26,909

901

902

903

-

904
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,575
-

905
01:11:41,617 --> 01:11:45,034
-

906
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:49,909
-

907
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:52,700
-

908
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:59,909
-

909
01:11:59,909 --> 01:12:06,366
The one who out fishes and sells them in the market.

910
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:10,783
But his body is so well built and shining

911
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:13,742
and the muscles so developed and the man,

912
01:12:13,783 --> 01:12:15,825
he stands up and the way he talks!

913
01:12:15,825 --> 01:12:17,909
And absolutely humble person.

914
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,783
No wonder Christ chose fishermen.

915
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:32,075
While he has got thousands of fishermen as his disciples,

916
01:12:32,575 --> 01:12:34,783
but he doesn't call them disciples,

917
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:36,159
he says they are all Mother's children.

918
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,533
Thousands! You don't know.

919
01:12:38,575 --> 01:12:40,617
He has been calling me to go to them,

920
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:42,825
and all that but they come to my programme, some of them.

921
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,241
And one day I have to go down, to those islands,

922
01:12:47,241 --> 01:12:49,742
any one of the islands he said you come they will be all there

923
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:51,575
the whole day waiting for you.

924
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:56,075
But the way he is there is surprising.

925
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:02,159
When I am there he brings fishes for me.

926
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:06,491
But I said, you see, I eat fishes that you bring

927
01:13:06,533 --> 01:13:08,742
but what about my other children.

928
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:12,783
He said no, next time, all the fishes will be sent to you.

929
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:14,992
And he sent one truck-load to me, you would not believe!

930
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:18,658
I said now I don't even have truck-load of disciples,

931
01:13:18,658 --> 01:13:20,491
who is going to eat all this?

932
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:26,408
And he said, "Nothing, I just went and told fishermen

933
01:13:26,408 --> 01:13:29,241
that Mother has asked for fishes and everybody gave their fishes.

934
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:31,075
One day they will not have fishes,

935
01:13:31,117 --> 01:13:33,199
what is there, what does it matter."

936
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,909
Imagine those people who live day-to-day in that country.

937
01:13:39,909 --> 01:13:44,241
Modi told the newspaper people

938
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:46,575
that we can control the elements

939
01:13:46,617 --> 01:13:48,325
somehow by Mother's grace.

940
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:52,199
So the newspaper people felt they were very much boasting.

941
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:55,450
But it is true, they can.

942
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:01,117
To them it is not boasting it is just what it is they are seeing.

943
01:14:01,117 --> 01:14:04,200
They are telling the truth, you see.

944
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:05,700
But that should happen.

945
01:14:05,742 --> 01:14:07,408
We should also have some things

946
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,283
to boast here. Important.

947
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:13,992
So now we have the other phase as I told you,

948
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:24,034
is of becoming the Guru of yourself.

949
01:14:24,617 --> 01:14:28,742
Detaching yourself, identifying yourself with the Spirit

950
01:14:28,783 --> 01:14:30,658
which is growing in its light.

951
01:14:32,825 --> 01:14:36,575
So detachment. One has to develop detachment.

952
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:39,450
'My' mother, it starts like that;

953
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:45,450
my mother is suffering from cancer, my father is suffering from madness,

954
01:14:46,075 --> 01:14:47,909
Mother can you cure them ?

955
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:52,992
So now first I cure mother and father.

956
01:14:53,491 --> 01:14:56,283
Then I'm married, my wife is like this,

957
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:05,199
my child is like this then my house, then my motorcar,

958
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:08,658
then my dog, then my umbrella!

959
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:18,867
I have to go suddenly from A to Z, from Z to A.

960
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:33,034
Alright, I can do, up to a point, but for what? For what?

961
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:37,533
Why to cure the mother, father, brother, sisters,

962
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:42,658
every relationship, the 10th marriage and the 11th divorce ?

963
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,199
Why to correct all this? For what?

964
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:55,408
It must have some purpose, and if that purpose cannot be served,

965
01:15:55,992 --> 01:15:58,783
what is the use of doing it?

966
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:05,658
The purpose is that you at least leave all these things in my hands

967
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:07,992
and detach yourself.

968
01:16:08,034 --> 01:16:11,117
But you want to bring the case to Me as well as worry about it.

969
01:16:12,241 --> 01:16:14,450
Detachment.

970
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:20,075
But the idea of detachment is this!

971
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,575
"I'm very detached about money, Mother, absolutely.

972
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:26,283
I'm not bothered. I keep the lights on,

973
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:27,950
why to worry about money ?"

974
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,992
This is the argument,

975
01:16:31,992 --> 01:16:36,200
"Why should we worry about looking after the gas and all that,

976
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:41,034
after all we are detached people. We are in detachment, you see.

977
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:43,742
We are not attached to money."

978
01:16:43,909 --> 01:16:45,575
But who is going to pay ?

979
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:52,658
The other type of detachment that. I see, very interesting one is this one:

980
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:59,325
"I'm very detached, so I'm not bothered about having a bath,

981
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,575
having all kinds of diseases,

982
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:06,617
having all kinds of problems within myself,

983
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,283
giving my problems to others. I'm detached!

984
01:17:09,742 --> 01:17:13,408
Why should I cover myself ? I'm detached.

985
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:16,075
If I get cold, I'm detached,

986
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:18,408
let everybody get cold from me.

987
01:17:19,783 --> 01:17:21,825
What can I do, I'm detached.

988
01:17:22,366 --> 01:17:24,825
I've got cold, so what does it matter,

989
01:17:24,825 --> 01:17:26,325
I'm a detached personality.

990
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,742
Why should others mind?

991
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:29,617
They should also get detached."

992
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:38,241
This is the ridiculous limit we can go

993
01:17:38,283 --> 01:17:44,366
in our idea of detachment! Detachment is from within.

994
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:53,159
You are not bothered. You are not bothered.

995
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:55,366
You know your Mother.

996
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:59,992
The first detachment is shown in generosity.

997
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:11,117
Detachment is generosity. Grezna is.

998
01:18:11,533 --> 01:18:14,617
She sold her ornaments for nothing at all.

999
01:18:14,658 --> 01:18:16,575
I mean I would never have accepted that money,

1000
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:19,575
but she just sold them. It's remarkable.

1001
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:27,366
She sold them She is Polish not English. She sold her ornaments ;

1002
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:29,575
and this is what communism has done to people.

1003
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,241
They are very detached,

1004
01:18:31,283 --> 01:18:33,700
communists are very detached people I tell you.

1005
01:18:36,617 --> 01:18:41,825
Of course I would never take that money, that's theirs,

1006
01:18:41,867 --> 01:18:44,867
but the way she did it, just like that.

1007
01:18:44,867 --> 01:18:51,034
For God's work alright what is ornaments, take it.

1008
01:18:51,075 --> 01:18:55,992
I mean you know I've given away so many of my ornaments

1009
01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:57,992
to keep relations alright.

1010
01:19:00,617 --> 01:19:03,742
The other day I gave away my Kara to Christine,

1011
01:19:03,742 --> 01:19:05,700
you know that when she got engaged.

1012
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,867
Just it came out of the hand and went away.

1013
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:13,241
I was detached you see, I never even felt the coming out !

1014
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,408
So much detached that Christine told me

1015
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:21,159
she was cramped up with pressure but to me it was just, just nothing.

1016
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:32,658
Dust. So that detachment has to come.

1017
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:37,241
Now you should know which part you are there.

1018
01:19:37,241 --> 01:19:42,867
Like idea of detachment should not be

1019
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:47,742
that - I would say hippy style of detachment,

1020
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,950
that you have right to exploit everybody else.

1021
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:54,950
And the other type as I told you. which is very ridiculous.

1022
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:58,491
It's not an idea, it's a thing,

1023
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:02,408
it's your awareness itself which is detached.

1024
01:20:09,283 --> 01:20:15,283
So, these four things for your material side is important.

1025
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:23,034
What you eat is not so important,

1026
01:20:23,075 --> 01:20:24,450
because whatever you eat,

1027
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,867
if the brain is going to be such a non-sensical thing

1028
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:30,325
it's better whether you eat it or not, makes no difference does it?

1029
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:34,159
Analyze it, like in the hotel, what will you have,

1030
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,159
" I'll have pancakes," what will you have,

1031
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:38,283
" I'll have this I'll have that", for what ?

1032
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:41,034
I just don't understand why waste so much energy,

1033
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:43,700
why not you all have pancakes all of you put together.

1034
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:49,533
It's a very big thing you know. Or, today I'll have this.

1035
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:56,575
"I". Out of all this materialism what comes out is Mr "I".

1036
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:01,075
So we develop this Mr I.

1037
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:06,075
So the word "I" must go away, we should speak "we".

1038
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:13,325
"We" means you and all the Sahaja Yogis put together.

1039
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:19,075
When you say "we" you will find it will be different.

1040
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:22,491
Or take your name, like "this Norman."

1041
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:28,283
"This Norman won't listen," like children say.

1042
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:31,950
I asked a little boy, will you go home ? "

1043
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:39,658
I will go, but this (his name was Munna) this Munna, won't go,

1044
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:50,117
he's very obstinate, what can I do ?" This is detachment.

1045
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,159
To speak in third person is detachment,

1046
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:58,658
in which you are not in the picture...

1047
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,283
you are a witness.

1048
01:22:00,325 --> 01:22:01,491
You are the witness in the show.

1049
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:05,325
So this detachment should work in such a way

1050
01:22:05,366 --> 01:22:07,325
that you should witness the whole show,

1051
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:08,867
you're not involved into it.

1052
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:13,617
But just see what happens, in collectivity also.

1053
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,950
It becomes a political issue certainly,

1054
01:22:17,992 --> 01:22:22,117
in Sahaja Yoga also, political issue; nothing short of political issue!

1055
01:22:22,658 --> 01:22:29,491
We are not here fighting like union leaders.

1056
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,575
We are all leaders ! Where is the time to fight?

1057
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,159
Whom are we to fight , that we have to decide.

1058
01:22:43,742 --> 01:22:47,575
So, as far as all these things concerned,

1059
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:51,700
are detachment and attachment to Spirit.

1060
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:56,241
So we go further,

1061
01:22:56,283 --> 01:23:00,617
see now what should be our attitude on our mental level.

1062
01:23:02,366 --> 01:23:08,159
Physically you have seen that you have to develop

1063
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:12,366
a complete detachment in these four ways that I have told you.

1064
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:16,617
Now on your mental level what you have to do,

1065
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:27,825
is to understand the essence of every writing,

1066
01:23:28,325 --> 01:23:33,159
try to discriminate between Vidya and avidya.

1067
01:23:33,325 --> 01:23:41,742
Because avidya will kill you, will take away your energy,

1068
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:45,366
but vidya will sustain.

1069
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:51,491
So try to find out books which are supporting vidya.

1070
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:54,909
I was surprised, there is a lady Barbara,

1071
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:56,950
she met only last time Gavin,

1072
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:00,575
and she has written such a tremendous book, you'd be amazed!

1073
01:24:01,992 --> 01:24:05,742
I mean of such a level on Sahaja Yoga ! Very direct.

1074
01:24:05,783 --> 01:24:10,283
I'll show you that, and you know that book is now being considered

1075
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:13,575
for giving her a.doctorate, can you believe it I

1076
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:15,491
In an American university;

1077
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:17,117
of course that's only possible in America.

1078
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:23,159
But still that book has that level,

1079
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:25,075
I was amazed at the book!

1080
01:24:25,117 --> 01:24:31,658
So try to gather nourishment, like reading Devi Mahatmya,

1081
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,199
reading about, finding out about Bible

1082
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,450
and finding about other scriptures, about Koran - this that,

1083
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:41,909
and which supports you, which nourishes you.

1084
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:51,825
Blake, Kabir, Nanaka. I mean there are so many, Laotze.

1085
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,950
This is the good - is the knowledge. But you'll be amazed,

1086
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:59,491
once you start doing it, it comes to you.

1087
01:24:59,491 --> 01:25:06,408
I met a man near Rahuri - as you know we go there,

1088
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:12,950
and there's a man who just drives a bullock cart,

1089
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:17,783
and he had brought the bullock cart to take me down

1090
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:20,909
to one of the programmes, you know what we do there.

1091
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:24,199
And he was sitting there, we were waiting, I was talking, to him.

1092
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:27,117
And I felt an Avadhuta is sitting there to drive me,

1093
01:25:27,117 --> 01:25:30,700
I mean uneducated absolutely, he's never known books,

1094
01:25:30,742 --> 01:25:33,241
he does not know how to write, but the way he was talking I said,

1095
01:25:33,283 --> 01:25:36,366
"Oh God, from where this knowledge!

1096
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:44,159
From where was all this coming, this wisdom!

1097
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:45,909
Such wisdom, I tell you!''

1098
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:50,366
Such wisdom that I was just stunned, I was stunned really!

1099
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:54,658
From a man who is not even been to any school-college.

1100
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,992
Christ did not go to any school or college.

1101
01:25:59,034 --> 01:26:01,075
Such wisdom, you can't imagine.

1102
01:26:01,117 --> 01:26:03,241
You meet him next time when you go there.

1103
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:08,950
If somebody could translate him... you feel like touching his feet

1104
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,700
the way - extremely unassuming simple man,

1105
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:18,992
wearing a white, clean topi and clean dress and driving me down.

1106
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,658
And to him this was the greatest privilege of the whole world --

1107
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,992
is to drive me; he said "It must be the greatest of all --

1108
01:26:26,034 --> 01:26:28,658
something I must have done - to be able to drive you."

1109
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,075
And in such simple ways he was explaining to me

1110
01:26:33,075 --> 01:26:36,159
about the character of the bullocks and the human beings --

1111
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:40,742
just imagine! And the things he talked about,

1112
01:26:40,783 --> 01:26:43,491
if I tell you, you won't believe - so I just don't know...

1113
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:50,742
That's the sign of a great man, he doesn't talk of frivolous things,

1114
01:26:50,742 --> 01:26:52,825
he has no time to talk about frivolous things.

1115
01:26:52,825 --> 01:26:54,408
I have seen my own grandchildren --

1116
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,575
they never talk of frivolous things, they have no time,

1117
01:26:56,575 --> 01:26:58,117
they are busy, you know.

1118
01:26:58,117 --> 01:27:00,700
All the time clearing out, when they came here, they said

1119
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,366
"We have to clear out this Brompton Square,

1120
01:27:02,408 --> 01:27:04,491
then we have to clear out this Knights bridge,

1121
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:06,117
then we have to clear out this London,

1122
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,909
then we have to clear out this England.

1123
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:09,450
Where is the map of England, bring it,"

1124
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:12,075
all the time they were busy, you see, clearing out, and then,

1125
01:27:12,117 --> 01:27:13,575
"this place is this, this place is this.

1126
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:15,408
Oh God this horrible,

1127
01:27:15,408 --> 01:27:17,159
bring some shoes, do this do that,"

1128
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:19,700
all the time they were busy morning till evening.

1129
01:27:19,742 --> 01:27:22,658
They would go upstairs in the room and they are busy.

1130
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,450
They are busy people, they have no time to talk

1131
01:27:24,491 --> 01:27:26,034
of the mundane things and all that.

1132
01:27:26,034 --> 01:27:28,159
Then I brought some dolls and toys, for them.

1133
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:32,241
They put all of them there and they put them, and the map there,

1134
01:27:32,241 --> 01:27:36,199
"now see now, (to dolls) now you look after, alright ?"

1135
01:27:36,241 --> 01:27:39,658
You know they're talking to dolls like that.

1136
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,617
Dolls are their disciples. Teaching the dolls,

1137
01:27:41,658 --> 01:27:45,408
"you see, don't sit like this, you must sit properly, you don't know.

1138
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,992
You can't bend your knees ?

1139
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:49,034
Better learn that, you must learn to bend your knees,"

1140
01:27:49,075 --> 01:27:51,658
because dolls have straight legs!

1141
01:27:56,491 --> 01:27:59,742
And all the boys, even the little children,

1142
01:27:59,783 --> 01:28:02,825
I have seen the way they are busy all the time doing Sahaja Yoga.

1143
01:28:05,325 --> 01:28:09,366
Every level they are working.

1144
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:16,283
As today I was telling Rustom about my own father.

1145
01:28:17,117 --> 01:28:19,075
You see, he was a learned man, of course.

1146
01:28:19,075 --> 01:28:23,992
But when he talked, he used to talk of something,

1147
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:28,992
like I told him about the state of a person, called Sambhranta.

1148
01:28:29,575 --> 01:28:34,075
He told me that, "Human beings are very different from God.

1149
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:38,241
When God incarnates then the Sambhranta state,

1150
01:28:38,283 --> 01:28:41,034
which is awakening between the subconscious

1151
01:28:41,075 --> 01:28:46,992
to the conscious state, is direct, you see.

1152
01:28:46,992 --> 01:28:49,200
He comes down directly But human beings

1153
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:53,950
go this way, they never go straight.

1154
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,992
See God descends, so he descends properly,

1155
01:28:57,034 --> 01:28:59,950
but ascent is always in a very separate way.

1156
01:28:59,992 --> 01:29:02,617
It goes on like this, and he gathers everything

1157
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:06,408
that is in his subconscious, so the Sambhranta state,

1158
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:09,742
where he is waking up, is such a dangerous thing

1159
01:29:09,742 --> 01:29:11,283
that he can gather up anything.

1160
01:29:11,325 --> 01:29:14,950
And by the time he gathers up the dreams he becomes something so funny.

1161
01:29:15,034 --> 01:29:19,909
He may look at God whom he has seen in his dream

1162
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:23,241
like a witch, and the witch like a bird."

1163
01:29:23,867 --> 01:29:32,533
I saw him always busy. I mean to talk to him,

1164
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:36,783
I found a companion and he found me a companion sort of a thing.

1165
01:29:36,825 --> 01:29:39,159
He could talk, because his attention was there.

1166
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:42,075
His attention was not how every body has made their hair,

1167
01:29:42,075 --> 01:29:45,575
and how they are sitting down or what dresses they are making,

1168
01:29:45,617 --> 01:29:47,742
or what do you have in this thing - nothing.

1169
01:29:47,783 --> 01:29:53,575
His attention was on the Spirit, his own Spirit and Spirit of others.

1170
01:29:53,617 --> 01:30:01,241
And he was so dynamic in his brain that he knew your dictionary

1171
01:30:01,241 --> 01:30:02,491
by heart, I tell you.

1172
01:30:02,491 --> 01:30:04,700
He never consulted dictionary all his life --

1173
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,700
neither Sanskrit nor English, and he was master of 14 languages.

1174
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:14,825
Can you imagine! How he must have managed!

1175
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:18,450
He used to play tennis very well, he used to swim for 3 miles every day.

1176
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,992
3 miles. He had muscles that he could just lift you up. Yes!

1177
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:29,491
Very healthy personality, healthy man.

1178
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:31,992
Very generous, very generous.

1179
01:30:32,034 --> 01:30:34,450
Much more generous than me, so you can imagine.

1180
01:30:34,491 --> 01:30:36,992
Very generous, to him nothing mattered,

1181
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:38,700
"alright you like it, take it".

1182
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,283
He'll starve himself but he'll be generous.

1183
01:30:42,325 --> 01:30:46,200
And a man of principle.

1184
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:51,825
So we come to the second point which is actually

1185
01:30:51,867 --> 01:30:54,617
we have started the fifth one - which is mentally

1186
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:59,283
you must only take to things which are nourishing.

1187
01:31:03,408 --> 01:31:05,283
Through vibratory awareness you will know.

1188
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:09,491
Ask other Sahaja Yogis, if you do not know.

1189
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:12,491
But take nourishing things to read and not horrible,

1190
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,783
detrimental to your growth.

1191
01:31:14,825 --> 01:31:17,366
If you read them, you are responsible:

1192
01:31:17,408 --> 01:31:22,241
You are real great readers I must say --

1193
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:24,575
you ask any name, everyone knows.

1194
01:31:24,617 --> 01:31:26,408
I said who was Gropius, everyone knows.

1195
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,283
You need not be an academician to tell.

1196
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:31,950
Everyone knows, what happened, who is this, who is that.

1197
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:35,034
Out of your seeking you have done one good thing --

1198
01:31:35,075 --> 01:31:37,491
to have read everything whether good or bad,

1199
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:39,366
whatever it is.

1200
01:31:39,408 --> 01:31:41,700
But now after realisation, you must try to find out

1201
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,199
what you have to read, what you have to know,

1202
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:45,950
it should be nourishing.

1203
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:49,909
Talk that is nourishing, helpful.

1204
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:55,533
So in talk you should have compassion.

1205
01:31:55,533 --> 01:32:00,283
If you are talking to someone you should be full of compassion.

1206
01:32:00,325 --> 01:32:02,491
Sahaja Yoga is a system of compassion.

1207
01:32:02,491 --> 01:32:07,159
A Guru has to be very-very patient.

1208
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:10,408
It is not like other Gurudom,

1209
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,658
or even real Gurus had no patience.

1210
01:32:14,533 --> 01:32:19,867
This is a system where patience is the only way it will work out,

1211
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:22,075
because no Gurus gave realisation, it is only you

1212
01:32:22,075 --> 01:32:24,533
who have to give it. And you know what is realisation.

1213
01:32:24,575 --> 01:32:29,199
The other day we met one; the fellow sitting tight.

1214
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:37,117
They said, "We have failed Mother, we can't give him realisation,

1215
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:38,867
it's a hopeless case". I said, "Really ?"

1216
01:32:38,867 --> 01:32:41,950
So I went there - at the end of it you see, they said,

1217
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:43,408
"Mother there's one fellow sitting".

1218
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:46,491
I wanted to aviod, you see, but they said.

1219
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:52,783
Alright, so raised his Kundalini, raised it up, tied it up,

1220
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:57,992
my hands bearing now. "Oh no, I didn't feel anything".

1221
01:32:58,034 --> 01:33:04,992
I said, this fellow is least bothered

1222
01:33:05,034 --> 01:33:07,199
how much we are working on him!

1223
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,199
He's just thinking he's obliging us."

1224
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,617
So then two or three people came forward, brought a light,

1225
01:33:12,617 --> 01:33:16,075
put the light before him, did bandhan here and everything:

1226
01:33:16,117 --> 01:33:20,034
Again I raised his Kundalini thrice:

1227
01:33:20,075 --> 01:33:25,950
"No, not at all... ! "it went on like that for half an hour,

1228
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:27,283
then I gave up. I said,

1229
01:33:27,325 --> 01:33:29,075
"Sir, I'm sorry, you are too great

1230
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:33,408
for realisation! We'll try again".

1231
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:39,700
"I'm not convinced..." And I was fagged out,

1232
01:33:39,742 --> 01:33:43,200
I said "Really, I am convinced about you,

1233
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:45,825
so, you allow us to go", and then I came out.

1234
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:48,950
You have to have 'tremendous' patience and sense of humour --

1235
01:33:48,992 --> 01:33:50,867
you just can't tell him off.

1236
01:33:50,909 --> 01:33:53,283
You see if I told him ''You are good for nothing, useless,

1237
01:33:53,283 --> 01:33:57,867
you have a bad Kundalini you go away from here get away, get lost."

1238
01:33:57,867 --> 01:34:04,617
I couldn't say these things to him, I had to bear him through and not only,

1239
01:34:04,617 --> 01:34:07,825
in the end I had to say you are a great man, you see.

1240
01:34:07,867 --> 01:34:10,950
Because otherwise he would have used some other method.

1241
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,658
Because, already the ego was so big

1242
01:34:13,658 --> 01:34:16,950
that with all the pins I put inside it, it could not deflate,

1243
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:19,783
it was made of a special fibre I think !

1244
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,075
It was such a difficult task.

1245
01:34:26,117 --> 01:34:29,408
So one has to know that we have to be compassionate.

1246
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:34,075
We have to read something that nourishes our compassion.

1247
01:34:34,117 --> 01:34:39,199
Read of people who gave away everything that they had.

1248
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:45,658
Tukarama. Read Tukarama. Tukarama was a poor man.

1249
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:50,450
And one day he went to some place and did some good job,

1250
01:34:50,491 --> 01:34:56,034
so they gave him lots of sugar cane.

1251
01:34:56,408 --> 01:34:58,950
His children were very fond of sugar cane.

1252
01:34:59,992 --> 01:35:02,992
So on the way every child would ask, "give me one sugar cane".

1253
01:35:03,034 --> 01:35:04,450
He was giving to everyone.

1254
01:35:04,450 --> 01:35:06,241
When he came home only one was left.

1255
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:08,783
So the children said, "we are three".

1256
01:35:08,783 --> 01:35:12,075
He said, "It's alright; next time I will bring for you,

1257
01:35:12,117 --> 01:35:15,950
share it among you three". And they had it,

1258
01:35:15,992 --> 01:35:18,825
they said, "better have it, now one more child will come

1259
01:35:18,825 --> 01:35:20,450
and this will also go away".

1260
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:26,867
So one has to know about lives who have been giving.

1261
01:35:28,325 --> 01:35:31,408
Read about people who have been giving.

1262
01:35:32,075 --> 01:35:38,117
They gave their lives. They crucified them, they tortured them.

1263
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,325
They allowed to be exploited.

1264
01:35:40,366 --> 01:35:42,408
They allowed to be poisoned.

1265
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:46,575
Head of such sacrifice, of great sacrifices.

1266
01:35:46,617 --> 01:35:49,783
We are lucky people that we have seen all those things

1267
01:35:49,825 --> 01:35:51,325
with our own eyes.

1268
01:35:51,325 --> 01:35:54,783
But at least you be one of them, that you can at least,

1269
01:35:54,825 --> 01:36:00,325
if not see, visualise it. You can. Bring that as your principle.

1270
01:36:00,366 --> 01:36:06,617
So we move now, from detachment,

1271
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:10,533
which I've told you four types of detachment,

1272
01:36:10,575 --> 01:36:16,450
and then I told you the nourishment of your mind

1273
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,909
and nourishment to your heart.

1274
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:27,075
Nothing nourishes more to a person than giving away.

1275
01:36:27,575 --> 01:36:32,450
Nothing nourishes your heart, your compassion,

1276
01:36:32,491 --> 01:36:34,658
unless and until you learn to give away.

1277
01:36:34,825 --> 01:36:37,075
Now will you please make a list of things,

1278
01:36:37,075 --> 01:36:43,117
"how many things you have given away in this one year, last one year".

1279
01:36:43,159 --> 01:36:44,867
I can't because it is too much.

1280
01:36:47,617 --> 01:36:51,700
Please make a list of things, "how many things",

1281
01:36:51,742 --> 01:36:56,117
except for your brains you have given away to others

1282
01:36:56,742 --> 01:37:02,533
without thinking about it, or have thought of giving.

1283
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:10,658
Since Christmas let us say, to this Christmas.

1284
01:37:15,867 --> 01:37:23,867
Heart is opening. Think of giving.

1285
01:37:25,325 --> 01:37:31,491
On material level, other help is there to give.

1286
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:36,575
But no, we don't even give the other help,

1287
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:39,450
for which you don't have to spend any money.

1288
01:37:39,491 --> 01:37:41,117
Just give a hand.

1289
01:37:41,783 --> 01:37:45,909
I have seen, very easy to make out,

1290
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:48,658
labour saving devices.

1291
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:54,742
Now, I have come here, some will be running,

1292
01:37:54,783 --> 01:37:56,617
others are just sitting.

1293
01:37:56,617 --> 01:38:00,199
Tea is brought to them, food is brought of them everything is done.

1294
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:03,617
They'll just put the plate also before: go and wash.

1295
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:16,199
Its not only selfishness but it is unmannerly, unmannerly to be like this.

1296
01:38:20,034 --> 01:38:26,408
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be

1297
01:38:26,408 --> 01:38:31,200
extremely busy helping others,

1298
01:38:31,992 --> 01:38:35,241
at every point. To be helpful.

1299
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:39,825
You know Ravi Shankar's Guru was a very great,

1300
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:45,867
a very great man, a realized soul. He was a great person.

1301
01:38:45,867 --> 01:38:47,366
So he knew so many things.

1302
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:53,200
And one day I was there, in the night you see, there was a doctor,

1303
01:38:53,241 --> 01:38:57,867
we were his guests in a way, for dinner we had gone there.

1304
01:38:58,199 --> 01:38:59,909
In the night the call came that,

1305
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,199
"I need you very much" to the doctor.

1306
01:39:02,199 --> 01:39:03,700
The doctor said, "Now I'm tired".

1307
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:06,034
He was another very giving person, no doubt.

1308
01:39:06,034 --> 01:39:08,283
He said, "Oh you must come, I have a big problem.

1309
01:39:08,283 --> 01:39:12,117
See I saw a little baby."

1310
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,825
He said, "What baby have you found ?"

1311
01:39:14,867 --> 01:39:17,117
He said, "its a baby," he was an old man,

1312
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:22,783
he said, "I found a baby of a deer which is suffering now,

1313
01:39:22,783 --> 01:39:26,159
and the mother is dead and nobody is to look after it."

1314
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:30,200
So I said "Alright I'll also come with you",

1315
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:33,533
because I knew I will touch the baby. I went with him.

1316
01:39:33,575 --> 01:39:41,366
So, he was sitting with the little thing near his heart.

1317
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:44,450
So the doctor said, "What are you doing ?"

1318
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:48,075
He said, "I'm trying to give him my life if possible,

1319
01:39:48,075 --> 01:39:51,617
so that when you come at least you find him alive".

1320
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:53,992
Just like this, just love.

1321
01:39:53,992 --> 01:39:59,283
So he took out the thing - doctor - his coat and all that,

1322
01:39:59,325 --> 01:40:01,325
and he said, "alright put it down".

1323
01:40:01,366 --> 01:40:03,533
He put it down very cautiously.

1324
01:40:03,575 --> 01:40:05,283
I mean he was a realized soul, no doubt.

1325
01:40:05,283 --> 01:40:09,366
I put my hand on the thing and it came to life,

1326
01:40:09,408 --> 01:40:11,992
and it started, alright, he was very happy.

1327
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:16,533
He said, "You are a Devi, you are a Goddess, I can tell you.

1328
01:40:16,575 --> 01:40:18,617
But one bad thing you have done." I said "What ? "

1329
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:22,159
You are married." I said, "But Devis must marry, also."

1330
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:25,075
He said, "No, supposing you have married a miserly man,

1331
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:26,617
then what will happen to you ?"

1332
01:40:26,658 --> 01:40:29,408
I said, "I will see to it that, I don't marry a miserly man.

1333
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:34,575
That would be the greatest curse."

1334
01:40:34,617 --> 01:40:37,117
He said, "I had the same type of a wife who was miserly,

1335
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:39,825
and I got fed up with her for her miserliness."

1336
01:40:40,783 --> 01:40:44,325
So that is what it is : miserliness should be hated,

1337
01:40:44,366 --> 01:40:50,867
absolutely to be hated, absolutely to be the worst of all.

1338
01:40:50,867 --> 01:40:54,325
It's like leprosy for Sahaja Yogis. Miserliness.

1339
01:40:54,325 --> 01:40:56,575
It's saving saving pounds, you know.

1340
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:01,909
That must go away from your mind,

1341
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:09,825
Miserliness to yourself is good, miserliness to others is bad.

1342
01:41:09,867 --> 01:41:12,325
Gregoire told me a shocking thing.

1343
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:14,199
He said, "this is our culture."

1344
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,199
I said "Your culture ! what is it ?"

1345
01:41:16,658 --> 01:41:20,283
You see, he said that "if we go in a hotel, and if somebody is paying,

1346
01:41:20,325 --> 01:41:22,075
we start looking this side and that."

1347
01:41:22,117 --> 01:41:24,992
I said, "Really !". He said, that is very common.

1348
01:41:30,575 --> 01:41:32,742
I just cannot believe it ! This is culture!

1349
01:41:32,783 --> 01:41:35,783
It is the opposite of culture. Whatever you may call it,

1350
01:41:35,825 --> 01:41:39,200
it's not culture at all. Culture would be to come forward,

1351
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:42,992
"Alright I'll pay". But Americans are even worse, they'll say,

1352
01:41:43,034 --> 01:41:45,658
"I paid for you yesterday, you pay today for me."

1353
01:41:47,909 --> 01:41:51,283
It's absolutely disgraceful miserliness.

1354
01:41:52,034 --> 01:41:55,533
But this is gracious; you see when somebody is paying,

1355
01:41:55,533 --> 01:41:58,325
you look on the other side. It may be gracious, I don't know,

1356
01:41:59,742 --> 01:42:04,241
whatever it is, it's just the same ; filth I tell you.

1357
01:42:04,283 --> 01:42:07,450
So compassion ; compassion at any point.

1358
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:09,867
You may have to work till 2 o'clock, you may .

1359
01:42:09,909 --> 01:42:11,783
have to work at 4 o'clock, doesn't matter.

1360
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:13,867
You have to work, you have to work, you have to work;

1361
01:42:13,909 --> 01:42:17,159
because compassion itself is joy giving,

1362
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:22,283
because your Spirit is the Ocean of Compassion.

1363
01:42:22,283 --> 01:42:28,909
There is no other way, there is no other way

1364
01:42:28,909 --> 01:42:33,199
to enjoy your Spirit but to Give, to Give, to Give.

1365
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,742
Doesn't matter if you have not eaten your food, doesn't matter.

1366
01:42:35,783 --> 01:42:39,117
Nothing matters.

1367
01:42:40,617 --> 01:42:46,159
Many a times a you know that I don't have food for 24 hours sometimes,

1368
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:47,950
still I am giving.

1369
01:42:47,992 --> 01:42:50,742
Its not necessary for this body to eat,

1370
01:42:50,783 --> 01:42:55,283
the food of this body is compassion. That nourishes.

1371
01:42:57,533 --> 01:43:00,408
So you have to be miserly towards yourself,

1372
01:43:00,450 --> 01:43:02,283
but you must have compassion.

1373
01:43:03,825 --> 01:43:06,450
Heart, open your heart.

1374
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:11,742
Open your heart first of all, for thankfulness.

1375
01:43:15,867 --> 01:43:19,658
This is the other quality one should have.

1376
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:23,575
It's a higher quality I should say, of thankfulness to God.

1377
01:43:23,617 --> 01:43:26,658
He has given you realization. He has given you this body.

1378
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,742
Do you realize that this body,

1379
01:43:28,783 --> 01:43:30,450
human body He has given to you.

1380
01:43:30,617 --> 01:43:32,992
He has given you everything. Count your blessings.

1381
01:43:34,034 --> 01:43:37,950
Even to have the morning, to enjoy it as a human being.

1382
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:42,992
You are not in any bandhan, you are not in any pasha,

1383
01:43:43,034 --> 01:43:45,283
you are not pashus, you are not animals.

1384
01:43:45,325 --> 01:43:46,950
Animals are pashus.

1385
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:49,200
You are free people, God has given you freedom.

1386
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:56,533
And he has given you His realization. Sense of thankfulness.

1387
01:43:56,533 --> 01:44:00,075
But our language is such, "thank you, thank you, thank you," finished.

1388
01:44:00,117 --> 01:44:03,700
It is only in the lips, it finishes; lipservice.

1389
01:44:04,366 --> 01:44:11,117
From your heart thank Him, from your heart.

1390
01:44:11,159 --> 01:44:15,533
Not outside just go to church, "thank you. God very much,"

1391
01:44:15,575 --> 01:44:17,825
alright done, finished.

1392
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:32,159
It's to thank Him from your heart, write praise. Praise.

1393
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:41,283
Sing praise, "glory to God." to the great who has created us.

1394
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:45,533
Your disciples are sitting and every moment

1395
01:44:45,533 --> 01:44:49,408
when you are talking you are thinking about Mother or about God.

1396
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:57,450
You'll be amazed! It's only possible if you have sensitivity,

1397
01:44:58,909 --> 01:45:07,366
if you have memory. The greatest miracle of this world

1398
01:45:07,408 --> 01:45:11,700
is that everybody has to die and nobody remembers it.

1399
01:45:12,533 --> 01:45:16,199
But another one, is that everybody is blessed by God

1400
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:18,200
but nobody knows it.

1401
01:45:18,241 --> 01:45:22,783
But you are so specially blessed.

1402
01:45:28,075 --> 01:45:31,034
So what you should do ?

1403
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:40,075
Be in joy, be grateful, so that bliss comes to you.

1404
01:45:41,825 --> 01:45:45,533
Without thankfulness nothing is going to work out.

1405
01:45:45,575 --> 01:45:48,617
Thankful heart.

1406
01:45:48,658 --> 01:45:53,575
You need a heart that is thankful to God so that he gives you.

1407
01:45:53,617 --> 01:45:56,700
When you give others he will definitely give.

1408
01:45:56,742 --> 01:45:58,950
But don't think it is your own.

1409
01:46:01,783 --> 01:46:05,909
You are giving what God has given you.

1410
01:46:07,241 --> 01:46:13,283
So today I have told you 8-fold movement.

1411
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:17,533
So you have become half moon, only in mind.

1412
01:46:18,825 --> 01:46:25,617
And the other half, keep it for the next 'Guru Purnima'. Alright ?

1413
01:46:25,658 --> 01:46:28,909
MAY GOD BLESS YOU
