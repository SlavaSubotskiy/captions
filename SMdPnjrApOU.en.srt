1
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:23,496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

2
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:51,025
We have come to this place many a times,

3
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:52,993
this beautiful place, you all like it.

4
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:56,775
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

5
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:01,076
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

6
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:04,460
you have to spend lot of time.

7
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:13,982
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

8
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,795
and to be with the nature.

9
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:25,749
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

10
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,788
because it is the Sahasrara,

11
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:33,161
and it’s very surprising

12
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:36,297
that this fruit knows and understands.

13
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:41,580
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

14
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,568
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

15
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:48,221
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

16
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:52,313
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

17
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,539
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

18
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,655
we don’t think what we are doing.

19
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:05,036
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

20
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:08,667
and it’s so encouraging.

21
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:11,968
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

22
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:15,026
I congratulate them, all of them.

23
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:18,082
Now try to be...

24
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,566
Try to be kind to each other.

25
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,267
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

26
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:32,399
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

27
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,403
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

28
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,434
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

29
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,821
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

30
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:49,643
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

31
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,169
and you also talk.

32
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,776
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

33
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:02,135
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

34
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,561
that will make [you] very happy also.

35
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:09,249
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

36
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,630
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

37
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:18,245
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

38
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,201
and they’ll work out many things

39
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:23,323
which we could not work out.

40
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:37,244
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

41
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:41,653
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

42
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:56,485
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

43
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,728
because we are next to the sea here,

44
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,120
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

45
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,918
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

46
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:13,938
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

47
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:21,223
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

48
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:30,594
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

49
00:18:30,803 --> 00:18:35,864
people go and use it for bathrooms.

50
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:39,529
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

51
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,201
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

52
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:48,184
by which they wear funny dresses

53
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:52,630
and lead a very licentious life.

54
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,541
This is an insult to the sea.

55
00:18:55,742 --> 00:19:00,345
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

56
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:04,545
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

57
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:10,296
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

58
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:14,741
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

59
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:18,932
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

60
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,808
We cannot be disrespectful.

61
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,727
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

62
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:29,064
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

63
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:35,283
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

64
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:39,415
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

65
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:44,248
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

66
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,684
Sea is so important to our life.

67
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,036
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

68
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:55,017
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

69
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,262
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

70
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:07,542
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

71
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,958
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

72
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:15,847
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

73
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,899
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

74
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:24,404
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

75
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:28,610
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

76
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,890
it will appear on the other side.

77
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,239
It always keeps to its maryadas.

78
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:37,592
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

79
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,554
but they keep to their maryadas,

80
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:43,279
they never cross their maryadas.

81
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:50,880
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

82
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,867
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

83
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:58,865
that it just keeps to its own line.

84
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:02,385
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

85
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,701
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

86
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:07,620
it will be just there.

87
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:11,398
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

88
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,086
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

89
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:19,612
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

90
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:24,611
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

91
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,079
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

92
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,344
all the animals that are in it.

93
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:37,447
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

94
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:42,816
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

95
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:45,543
and that’s why it is, we should say,

96
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:49,940
the first life came into being in the sea.

97
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,479
So all our forefathers, long time back,

98
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,470
must have been born in the sea,

99
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:58,425
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

100
00:21:58,626 --> 00:22:01,459
So we have no right to insult the sea,

101
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,797
where our forefathers must have existed

102
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:07,776
and then they started coming out, one
by one

103
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:13,321
as the fish came, as a reptile.

104
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:23,781
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

105
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,818
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

106
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,652
If the depth of the sea is reduced

107
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:40,947
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

108
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:44,158
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

109
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:48,612
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

110
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:51,100
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

111
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,665
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

112
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:58,468
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

113
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,114
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

114
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,522
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

115
00:23:04,722 --> 00:23:06,618
deep understanding of ourselves,

116
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,819
because that’s the sign of dignity.

117
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,222
And that dignity you must have,

118
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,631
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

119
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:19,788
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

120
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:24,808
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

121
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:27,739
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

122
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:31,846
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

123
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:38,106
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

124
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,657
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

125
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:42,439
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

126
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,531
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

127
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:51,386
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

128
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:54,536
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

129
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:57,142
from places to places as we have been,

130
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:03,560
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

131
00:24:03,761 --> 00:24:06,083
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

132
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,028
the whole world can be very rich.

133
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,358
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

134
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,162
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

135
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:20,516
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

136
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:24,610
And lots of wealth which is of…

137
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,985
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

138
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:34,022
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

139
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:38,336
and we people will be enriched all over.

140
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:41,863
Moreover when we carry the transport,

141
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,285
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

142
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:50,961
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

143
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:57,140
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

144
00:24:57,341 --> 00:25:01,101
It reacts, because if there’s a light

145
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:06,486
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

146
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:09,553
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

147
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:12,419
The sea understands Me very well,

148
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,745
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

149
00:25:17,946 --> 00:25:22,738
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

150
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,308
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

151
00:25:25,508 --> 00:25:30,811
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

152
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:35,332
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

153
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,691
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

154
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:44,184
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

155
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:49,634
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

156
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:53,897
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

157
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:59,682
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

158
00:25:59,883 --> 00:26:04,801
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

159
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:13,337
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

160
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:16,920
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

161
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,125
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

162
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:25,232
In the same way we have to be;

163
00:26:25,432 --> 00:26:29,141
we have to bear the heat of others,

164
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:33,336
the anger of others and create vapours –

165
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,372
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

166
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:38,801
It is with Me, same thing.

167
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:42,234
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

168
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:46,956
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

169
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:50,716
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

170
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,161
They just start flowing as vibrations.

171
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,332
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

172
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:57,988
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

173
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:00,751
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

174
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,159
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

175
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,515
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

176
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:13,444
As you all are here, all these vapours

177
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:16,034
as vibrations should flow.

178
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,945
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

179
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:22,908
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

180
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,409
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

181
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,289
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

182
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,886
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

183
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,135
Are you afraid to treat someone?

184
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:39,384
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

185
00:27:39,585 --> 00:27:40,978
Why can’t you treat?

186
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,767
You all can treat them, you can help them,

187
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:49,613
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

188
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:54,121
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

189
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:58,728
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

190
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:02,720
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

191
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,082
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

192
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:11,077
Why should God give you vibrations

193
00:28:11,277 --> 00:28:15,478
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

194
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:20,541
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

195
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:26,772
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

196
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:31,969
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

197
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,788
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

198
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,738
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

199
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:42,997
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

200
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:46,619
if you start using these vibrations.

201
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:50,692
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

202
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,873
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

203
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,492
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

204
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,466
because you are not using your vibrations.

205
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:03,587
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

206
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,900
whenever is possible, to help others

207
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:10,450
to get all right, to get well.

208
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:14,417
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

209
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:17,038
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

210
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,484
but at least use My photograph.

211
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:23,271
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

212
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:29,695
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

213
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:33,326
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

214
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:38,881
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

215
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:41,970
You have to be seaworthy.

216
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:47,828
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

217
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:51,401
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

218
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:54,303
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

219
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,606
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

220
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,786
“We went there, then this happened,

221
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:02,222
then that happened, then this.”

222
00:30:02,423 --> 00:30:05,427
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

223
00:30:05,627 --> 00:30:09,255
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

224
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:12,462
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

225
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:16,701
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

226
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:21,157
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

227
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:26,083
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

228
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,999
by which you can save so many.

229
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,796
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

230
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:37,111
that the more you give, the more you get.

231
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:42,083
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

232
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:48,843
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

233
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:52,518
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

234
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:56,051
comes back at rivers. In the same way

235
00:30:56,252 --> 00:31:01,453
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

236
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:06,194
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

237
00:31:06,394 --> 00:31:12,746
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

238
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:14,808
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

239
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:19,511
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

240
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,640
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

241
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,196
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

242
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:27,837
that you can vibrate your own water,

243
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,891
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

244
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,269
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

245
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,016
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

246
00:31:45,143 --> 00:31:49,393
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

247
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:52,398
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

248
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,954
but have faith in yourself.

249
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:56,848
As the sea has faith in itself,

250
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,374
you should have complete faith in yourself.

251
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:02,561
You must respect your Self Realization.

252
00:32:02,761 --> 00:32:06,587
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

253
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:09,225
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

254
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:13,620
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

255
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,823
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

256
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,823
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

257
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:25,338
I have to try to work it out this way.”

258
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:33,719
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

259
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,907
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

260
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:42,580
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

261
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,565
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

262
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,204
Nothing else is needed.

263
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:50,880
May God bless you all.
