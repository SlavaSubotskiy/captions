1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:03,728
It is not difficult to find out

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:09,763
how this universe is organized.

3
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:19,680
Every scientist who is open minded can see for himself

4
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:29,387
that this universe is a beautiful cosmos, is very well organized

5
00:00:29,705 --> 00:00:32,264
and has run very smoothly

6
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:37,780
and can also deduce that the creation of this universe,

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,617
this particular universe

8
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:43,565
has led to the creation of this Mother Earth.

9
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:54,894
Five million years back, about, this Mother Earth

10
00:00:55,986 --> 00:01:03,783
in gaseous form seceded and was cooled down.

11
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:10,303
How was it cooled down, no-one knows.

12
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:18,001
But if it was cooled down, why is it not that cool as the Sun is?

13
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,892
Because in the science, nobody thinks as to ‘How?’

14
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:26,993
They just accept as it is.  They are not supposed to know,

15
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,879
or they cannot find out because they have limitations.

16
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:35,362
Why this thing happened? How it was done?

17
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:39,999
It is easy to say there is no God

18
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:45,595
but very difficult to explain many things
without saying that there is God,

19
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,980
For example, the time that was taken

20
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:57,515
for this universe to create a human being is so very short,

21
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:01,324
is so very short that nothing can explain it.

22
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,827
If you use the law of chance

23
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:13,958
– perhaps some of the mathematicians,
if they are here, they may know

24
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:21,862
– by which we can find out how many times

25
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:26,713
the permutations and combinations have to work

26
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:30,681
to create even a living cell.

27
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:41,504
For example, in a test tube if you have 50 red pills

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,896
and 50 white pills,

29
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:50,912
all arranged in such a manner
that all the red ones are at the bottom

30
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:59,127
and the white ones are on the top, you have to go on shaking them,

31
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:05,372
and when you go on shaking them, they are all disorganized.

32
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:13,993
Then to organize it fully how many times one has to shake?

33
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:21,394
They have discovered a formula,
that is N raised to power something, something.

34
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:33,737
According to this formula, if human beings are created by chance,

35
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:42,289
it seems an impossibility; because the time
that is taken so far is so short

36
00:03:42,468 --> 00:03:48,193
that only, at the most, may be,
some living cell could have been created.

37
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,660
Why a complicated human being has been created

38
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,412
and so beautifully it is organized within ourselves,

39
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:04,036
that it is hard to believe that some juggler
was not behind the show.

40
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:10,192
There must have been some scientist
who has achieved these results.

41
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:17,496
It could not have  been possible by some special hand

42
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:28,459
to do these things; I mean if there was no organization,

43
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:32,260
no thinking behind it, no planning behind it,

44
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,260
and  no powerful personality behind it,

45
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,943
The Almighty,  it could not have been possible.

46
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,783
As science has its limitations, of course, we cannot find out

47
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:54,361
how it was expedited, how it took place?

48
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,952
But we can see that we have achieved
something in the field of science,

49
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:11,416
by one method – perhaps that is
the method that was used to trigger this also that fast.

50
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:18,022
When I was young, as you are, when I was studying Myself

51
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,943
at that time, I could never have believed

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,558
that we could ever reach the moon; nobody could have believed.

53
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:29,604
If anyone would have said that, people would have laughed

54
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,689
at such a conjecture.

55
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:36,621
Even today if you tell My grandmother, she does not believe it.

56
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,094
She thinks it is just a story you are telling her.

57
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,852
But we have reached the moon, no doubt.

58
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:53,243
In this system, we have used a very wonderful system

59
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:59,692
of putting five capsules one into another

60
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:07,318
and the one capsule, the lowest capsule, explodes

61
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:11,794
and triggers the movement of the rest of the four .

62
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:17,012
Then the second one explodes, and gives an acceleration

63
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:22,548
many more times than it was already moving;

64
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:29,125
the speed increases in such a tremendous way

65
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:40,236
that suddenly we find

66
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:46,228
the acceleration is so multiple of the first one

67
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:51,830
that the second one, when it explodes,
it gives another push to the capsule.

68
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:56,251
Then the third one explodes at a point.

69
00:06:56,471 --> 00:07:03,256
Then the fourth one, and the fifth one is the
one that contains the spacecraft.

70
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:07,889
This kind of explosion from one to another,

71
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,408
through that built-in mechanism,

72
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:14,369
we have been able to achieve
this tremendous speed and acceleration.

73
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,939
In the same way our evolution has taken place.

74
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,623
We have got this idea, without even knowing about our evolution,

75
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:27,081
from the unconscious. We have come to know how it has happened,

76
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:33,707
but we cannot correlate both things together.

77
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:40,738
So, in the same way a human being was created out of amoebae

78
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:46,920
or amoebae was created out of all the elements in the same manner.

79
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,828
We can say that we were made again of five capsules.

80
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:58,026
The first one is the physical, our physical being.

81
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:05,268
Inside the physical being was kept our mental being.

82
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,127
Inside the mental being was kept the emotional being.

83
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:13,470
Inside the emotional being was kept the spiritual being

84
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:17,478
and inside the spiritual being was kept the spirit,

85
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,987
or our attention, you can say.

86
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:28,845
Kundalini is the one which triggers,

87
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:33,309
that is the one that explodes.

88
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:38,808
So Kundalini is in everything: the Kundalini force in everything.

89
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:45,413
But, the best it is, highest it is,
the most effective it is, is in the human beings.

90
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:53,879
Because force to evolve

91
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:03,700
from, say from carbon to amoebae [state/stage]
and amoebae to animal [state/stage]

92
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,887
and animal stage to human stage, exists in everyone.

93
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,007
Even in the elements it exists because elements also evolve.

94
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:20,233
We do not know how they evolve but it happens in the Nature,

95
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,994
that elements start changing their forms and [UNCLEAR]

96
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:29,069
and they become different elements.

97
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:33,512
The mass changes but we have no idea

98
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:39,411
because we have no way of measuring the [quantity/quantum?]
of this change that is taking place.

99
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:45,562
Then the animals also change.  Animals change, from… Many fishes,

100
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:53,734
they become reptiles. Out of reptiles many become mammals.

101
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,464
From mammals, many become human beings;

102
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,611
or you can say that monkeys or quadrupeds and then human beings.

103
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:06,818
All this happening takes place.  How many are destroyed,

104
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:10,102
and how many become, how many are transformed,

105
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:14,320
nobody has measured it and nobody has kept any account of it.

106
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:21,110
Today, we talk of a population problem.

107
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,588
Perhaps many animals have taken birth.
You can see the effect of that,

108
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,992
the way people are behaving; you can be sure that many animals

109
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:35,322
must have taken life and they have yet to go

110
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:37,993
–lot of evolution and training as a human being

111
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:40,732
to understand the value of human life.

112
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,576
But once a human being starts evolving within himself.

113
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:52,177
Now we have been human beings, as they say,

114
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:56,976
for 14,000 years – I think it is even more than that.

115
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,015
So we have been human beings say, for 14,000 years.

116
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,477
We have been inside growing through our freedom,

117
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:11,036
Human beings are the only people who get freedom

118
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,584
to evolve themselves, to understand

119
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,810
what is wrong and what is bad.

120
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:30,212
This freedom is granted because
without freedom you cannot go any further.

121
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,841
For example, when you are studying in the schools,
you are told 2 plus 2 is 4.

122
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,714
Then you are given tables and you are told that

123
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:44,095
2 times tables are like this
– you remember by heart and it is like this.

124
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:50,451
We do not question that 2 by 10, why is it? 2 into 10 why is it 20?

125
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:53,864
We do not question, we just go on and on and on.

126
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,230
But when you reach a certain standard of education,

127
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:01,106
say a graduation or a post graduation standard,

128
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,350
then you are given freedom to write thesis on this subject

129
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,243
– why is it that when you multiply 2 by 10 it is 20?

130
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,440
Because you have reached a certain stage of development.

131
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:18,722
At this stage you are given freedom to find out for yourself.

132
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:28,425
That is how you are developed and then by this development only

133
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,957
you can teach the other people who are coming up.

134
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:34,974
This is the way the evolution has been.

135
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:40,147
So far you have not felt your evolution:

136
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,796
from amoebae to this stage you have not felt.

137
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,521
You do not know how you became a human being,

138
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:51,898
you just take it for granted.  Even if you see your eyes,

139
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,755
they are so complicated.

140
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,510
It is such a complicated organ that if you start studying them

141
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,178
you will be amazed how things are made.

142
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,344
If you just prick a pin in my finger,
immediately there is a reflex action.

143
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:15,010
It is so nicely built, it is so nicely arranged;
it is so quick, it is so efficient,

144
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:19,027
that one is surprised and amazed

145
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:23,973
at the wonders of this kind of organization,
that is this human body.

146
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:29,072
But you see what human beings are,
they are inefficiency personified.

147
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:33,238
I sent four telegrams to my daughter and today she says

148
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:36,607
that she received one telegram after one month.

149
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:43,914
Human beings have been given freedom to understand

150
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:49,509
and to develop their own efficiency,
to receive the ultimate knowledge

151
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:57,477
of the Creator of this creation, the powers of this Creator.

152
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:05,446
And that is why a Kundalini is placed in the human beings alone.

153
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:13,244
Though there is Kundalini force and there is
Kundalini in another form in everything else that exists,

154
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:17,063
only in the human being, when they get their freedom,

155
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:30,753
this force is kept in the triangular bone,
dormant, to trigger the last jumping into the unknown.

156
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:39,315
Now this is there, this Kundalini exists.

157
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:49,548
But to begin with, if I say, before starting all this creation,

158
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:57,226
who was created first, is most interesting and may not be

159
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,748
very congenial to the mind of a scientist.

160
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,775
It is much beyond science I am talking now,

161
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:13,290
that much before anything was created on this Earth,

162
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:15,749
Holiness was created

163
00:15:18,608 --> 00:15:20,475
– what we call the Parviti.

164
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:26,298
Shri Ganesha is the deity of that Holiness.

165
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:31,556
God has created this Holiness to protect His creation.

166
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:36,687
This atmosphere of Holiness He created to protect

167
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:43,234
all the people, all the creative things which have been there,

168
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,580
which have been created by Him, otherwise

169
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,913
nothing would work out.

170
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:59,576
Just think if one of the Oceans was deeper even by 10 feet,

171
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,618
the balance of Earth would have toppled down;

172
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:11,391
just imagine what a speed this Mother Earth has,

173
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:16,495
it revolves with such a tremendous speed, goes round the Sun

174
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:22,943
regularly in a proper way, not in a round way,

175
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:25,542
but in a special style as you know.

176
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:34,792
She creates day and night for you: night to rest and day to work.

177
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:40,327
How She Herself has created this beautiful atmosphere for you

178
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:45,910
and has maintained the balance
and the temperature that was given to Her,

179
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:52,371
is only done by the power of Holiness that was created around.

180
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,542
Now, man in his foolishness is challenging that Holiness.

181
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,980
He thinks he can challenge God.

182
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,214
That’s the sign of his [dwarfness?].

183
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:17,526
If he had risen that high where
he could feel God pulsating in everything,

184
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,787
he would never have done that.

185
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:23,413
But before he could reach that state of perfection,

186
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,209
he has started talking about God.

187
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:32,260
Who is going to challenge his authority of this stupid man,

188
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:37,538
who doesn’t want to achieve his perfection and wants to talk big?

189
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:51,340
All pervading power is there of Holiness which corrects,

190
00:17:53,722 --> 00:18:00,289
which guides, which co-ordinates, which loves

191
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,474
and which organizes everything for you to get

192
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,928
this awakening within you.

193
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:45,477
So one must understand how Kundalini awakening
is the most important thing that has to happen.

194
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:52,739
Kundalini awakening is the only way
you are going to know your spirit, your Atma.

195
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:59,633
This is the most important happening in the history of creation.

196
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:04,501
It’s like the garden you spread out; you lay out the garden,

197
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:10,859
you put down everything, you plant the trees,

198
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:16,447
the trees have the flowers and now the time has come,
the fruits must appear.

199
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:21,838
It’s the most important thing and has to happen to every individual

200
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,566
who is seeking the Truth.

201
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:30,527
The trouble with truth is, that that also you have to see

202
00:20:30,782 --> 00:20:33,476
with humility in your own freedom.

203
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:36,962
Nobody can hypnotize people for seeking truth;

204
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:41,660
those who are hypnotized cannot understand.

205
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:45,238
In all your awareness, in all your freedom,

206
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:48,695
in all your understanding, in all your dignity,

207
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,467
you have to get the knowledge of truth.

208
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:55,858
But it is not just giving you a lecture that
you are going to understand.

209
00:20:56,016 --> 00:21:00,543
It is not brainwashing – that has been
done by all nonsensical people throughout.

210
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:06,420
It is the happening, the actualization
by which you reach that state of awareness

211
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:16,715
by which you develop the dynamics of collective consciousness.

212
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:21,031
Collective consciousness.

213
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:25,659
By which you become collectively conscious:

214
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:32,847
is an awareness which develops within you

215
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:37,026
– is real actualization.

216
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:41,616
As you are a human being, you know that,

217
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:46,695
when this capsule of human being was triggered,

218
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,308
you got lots of things as your awareness,

219
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:54,996
more than that of animals. ‘The University itself;

220
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,615
animals don’t have any universities.

221
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,810
Animals don’t understand gardens,

222
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:07,975
they don’t understand dirt and filth, they don’t understand beauty.

223
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:12,320
All this has come to you, built within you,

224
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,797
manifested as soon as you became human beings.

225
00:22:18,673 --> 00:22:23,375
So, as soon as you become the super human being,

226
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:32,277
you become aware of yourself within
and you become aware of others within.

227
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,511
This is the collective consciousness,

228
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,343
this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

229
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:43,737
Sahaja Yoga is the system of nature.

230
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,124
Is the system; the way this creation took place is also Sahaj:

231
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:54,913
Built in – Sahaja. ‘Sah’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

232
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,539
Everything is within you like a seed if you see.

233
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:02,940
Seed has a primule within it to sprout.

234
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:10,826
Seed has the complete [ path?] of the tree
that it is going to be and the trees it is going to be.

235
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:15,582
The whole thing is in the seed, in the same way in the human seed

236
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:19,699
the whole picture of what he is going to be is built in.

237
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,900
The whole mechanism is placed within him.

238
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,974
Now there are the undercurrents of your being,

239
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,404
which I’ve been describing this evening to you.

240
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,861
What are the forces that have built up human beings,

241
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:39,084
which are inside him. Only thing I would like to say

242
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:41,535
that you are like a computer made;

243
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:43,712
you are already made like a computer,

244
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:46,701
only thing is you are to be put to the mains.

245
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:51,174
If you are put to the mains then
the computer starts working by itself,

246
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:56,142
but it is not the way you understand a machine.
You are a human being,

247
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:58,638
and you know what is love.

248
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:01,547
To a scientist I cannot talk of love.

249
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:05,002
I am talking of Divine Holiness,

250
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,739
the love of God which has created you,

251
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:09,815
which wants you to know Him.

252
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,447
Through science you cannot love.

253
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,978
Every scientist must be loving somebody

254
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,974
– if not his children at least, his dog.

255
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,404
He must be loving flowers: if not flowers,

256
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,628
he might be loving his horses,

257
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,627
but he knows what is love.

258
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:34,611
And if he can understand that spark of love,

259
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:36,681
from where it has come,

260
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:43,611
love that I am talking about is a synthesis of all these powers.

261
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:48,490
Science deals with only a very little [of it?].

262
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:58,646
I will also tell you which part of this power deals

263
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:08,256
with our physical being and out of
which how much a scientist knows.

264
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,611
You will be surprised – if knowledge is an Ocean,

265
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:16,064
the scientist knows only a drop.

266
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:26,182
And to know the Ocean, the drop is to be dissolved in the Ocean.

267
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:31,629
But the drop cannot by his effort, become the Ocean

268
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:37,092
– the Ocean has to dissolve the drop.
And that is what Ocean has to do it,

269
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:47,166
if His creation has to have its fulfilment
and His beautiful creation is

270
00:25:49,392 --> 00:25:53,299
manifested in the human being.

271
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:57,674
The human being must find out his fulfilment.

272
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,403
If he cannot find out his fulfilment,

273
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:08,075
he cannot reach any perfection in any one of his endeavours

274
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:13,442
and God Himself will not rest till he does that.

275
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:17,347
Because who would like to destroy one’s own creation

276
00:26:18,188 --> 00:26:24,731
of thousands and thousands of years of a pre-planned thing.

277
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,379
This has to come to its fulfilment

278
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,582
and if it is to be done by Me,

279
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:36,819
if I am the person who is supposed to trigger your Kundalini,

280
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,397
why should you have any objection?

281
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,571
Thank God, I was not a scientist;

282
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:48,794
otherwise I would have finished my life making an atom bomb.

283
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:56,600
Thank God, I am not a psychologist;
otherwise I would have gone mad, listening to mad people.

284
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:01,993
Thank God, I am not a politician, you know how they are.

285
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:07,585
Thank God, I am none of these, I am just your Mother;

286
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:15,332
concerned, absolutely concerned,

287
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:21,309
about your ultimate well being and not superficial things.

288
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:29,414
We’ll have the meditation now
– that’s more important than any one of these lectures.

289
00:27:29,595 --> 00:27:32,995
I’ve already given 84 tapes to these London people

290
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:37,153
– I’ve been speaking and speaking, every day two to three lectures.

291
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,090
Best thing is to have it.

292
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,592
Now some of you who do not get it should not get upset with Me.

293
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:48,619
If you do not get it, there is nothing to worry.

294
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:54,524
If you get it, well and good.  If you don’t get it,
you’ll get it this evening, if not tomorrow.

295
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:58,899
It is a very subtle happening: should happen to you.

296
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:05,579
If it happens, immediately you’ll find the relaxation will come.

297
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,060
But the best thing that happens to you

298
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:12,477
is first of all is your physical being is absolutely [different?]

299
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,806
Now this lady now has come here with a very serious disease.

300
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:25,657
If she had come to Me earlier
– [Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi to someone]…

301
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,656
So if this lady had come to Me at the end,
she would never have [UNCLEAR].

302
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:35,890
If she had come to Me and got her realization,

303
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:41,333
she would have been alright today.
But she said she did not know about it.

304
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,909
What’s the use of getting ill and then coming to Me,

305
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,539
asking for My blessing and all sorts of things

306
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,190
instead of getting your realization or

307
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:57,215
in keeping your very good health to begin with?

308
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,638
It comes to you as a by product.

309
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,350
That comes to you as a by product.

310
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:05,230
It is not done through Me.  Because,

311
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:09,409
say now, how you have decorated when I’m coming in here

312
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,632
– in the same way, if the light has to come,

313
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:18,003
the Divine has to shine, your own body is cleansed.

314
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,851
Is beautified and is made healthy;

315
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:25,975
that’s as a by product.   But that’s not the ultimate.

316
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:32,790
The light has to come within you,
the reality has to be pulsating within you;

317
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:38,726
unless and until that happens, everything else has no meaning.

318
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:44,322
The other things that can happen is if you are mentally…

319
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:49,958
Also upset – or as I have said,
the physical, the mental, the emotional,

320
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,896
then the spiritual – and then beyond that is the state

321
00:29:56,131 --> 00:30:00,755
of complete bliss, of collective consciousness is established:

322
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,951
In the space you are thrown.

323
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,799
In the same way, it happens within you,

324
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:12,103
so naturally all these things are
[UNCLEAR –exploded?] and normalised

325
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:16,350
and the ultimate is established in the space.

326
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:22,418
Whatever is useless or sick falls off.

327
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:24,892
Whatever is beautiful comes up.

328
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:29,918
As in the tree, you have seen that when the fruit comes up,

329
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:32,114
so many things have to drop.

330
00:30:32,243 --> 00:30:37,028
In the same way, all that is not wanted drops out

331
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:42,301
and all that is required shows itself and manifests.

332
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,206
It’s a very beautiful happening – it should happen to all of you

333
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:50,309
– but again I would like to tell you,
it is a very subtle happening.

334
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:52,027
It was never this way.

335
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:56,806
Only for the first time that it has started working this way;

336
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:05,313
that it is given to people who are [Sanskrit?]

337
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:10,215
– who are simple people, ordinary people, leading a very

338
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:15,332
simple life.  Because it has to happen that way because,

339
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:21,954
supposing there is a discovery of electricity

340
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:26,813
by one person, which has a big history behind it.

341
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:32,609
And he discovers something, and
he does not make it useful for the common people.

342
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:36,008
If the common people cannot benefit by it,

343
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:40,407
if the ordinary people cannot understand it, it has no meaning.

344
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:45,582
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga has to go to common people;

345
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:51,563
everybody must understand.  Otherwise,
people like Christ were crucified – nobody understood Him.

346
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,406
People like Kabira, nobody understood.

347
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,975
People like Nanaka was tortured.

348
00:31:57,677 --> 00:32:00,744
People like Mohammed-Sahib was given poisons,

349
00:32:01,115 --> 00:32:07,181
and every one of them had to just suffer
because of the ignorance of the common people.

350
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,499
Today, the time has come for common people to be realised.

351
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:19,981
Let’s try how many of you get it.
If you get it, then it’s a subtle thing,

352
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:25,254
but to settle into Sahaja Yoga, you have to practise.

353
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,039
You have to come at least once a month – at least minimum –

354
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:34,149
to a general program, because it is a collective program.

355
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:40,371
It’s a common program, and that’s
why it is going to work out in Collective;

356
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:43,581
individually it’s not going to work out.

357
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,065
Individually it’s very difficult.

358
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:50,547
As you know about Hatha yogis

359
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:53,321
– how they have to stay in the jungle.

360
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:58,164
Before they were twenty five years of age,
Hatha Yoga was to work out with [UNCLEAR Ashtang?]

361
00:32:58,282 --> 00:33:02,008
Not the way the modern hatha yoga is all wrong:
Absolutely wrong.  It should not be

362
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:03,551
– it’s the wrong style.

363
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:09,879
Because this kind of Hatha yoga takes your attention only to
your physical being and gives you an imbalance.

364
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:14,508
The other day I had somebody who was a great Hatha yogi
and he had a heart attack.

365
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:17,551
So he told Me he got a heart attack after Hatha yoga.

366
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:19,542
So I said then what did he do?  So he said,

367
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:23,288
‘They gave me another yoga to remove this heart attack.’

368
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:26,980
And when he came here for Me, he was shaking, just like this.

369
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:29,222
So I told him, ask for the man who is shaking,

370
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:33,162
and this man was a possessed man from a lunatic asylum.

371
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,277
I said, ‘This is what has happened to your nerves.

372
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:38,460
Who are asking to break your neck for nothing at all?

373
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:41,175
There was no need for you to go to such an extreme.

374
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:44,339
You should have just waited; you would have got your realisation.’

375
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,898
Of course, [UNCLEAR Asanas?] also have a place,

376
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:49,671
but you must understand the complete shastra:

377
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:55,528
Complete science of all these things must be understood.

378
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:59,200
But that is after realisation, not before.

379
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:02,828
For example, you are suffering from stomach trouble

380
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:05,231
and if you start using an asana for your neck,

381
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:08,844
you’ve had it: your neck will be gone
and then your stomach will be [next?].

382
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,220
So there is a big science behind

383
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:14,938
and those who understand the science will not use it for such a

384
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:18,922
long time, every day, religiously – there is no need to.

385
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:23,043
Whenever there is some need, then only take the medicine.

386
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,028
Do you go on staying in a medicine shop all your life,

387
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:28,604
just to keep healthy?

388
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,734
Same thing is about Mantra.

389
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:35,055
Mantra also has got a very big science;

390
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,024
once you understand that science that is [UNCLEAR].

391
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:41,514
Without realisation, mantra also has no meaning.

392
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:45,602
Those who give you mantras are people who are [UNCLEAR]

393
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:48,862
They don’t understand any meaning of mantra, I can tell you.

394
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:55,289
Because I have seen, the way they are knowing the chakras
and things, and the Kundalini doesn’t rise.

395
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:58,924
The basic thing is that your Kundalini must rise.

396
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:03,604
Those people who spoil your Kundalini, I do not like them at all.

397
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:07,016
Some of them spoil because they are naïve;

398
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:12,502
they don’t know what to do about Kundalini
because they are not authorised.

399
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:15,926
They are not holy people, they are not realised souls.

400
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,954
They are not supposed to do it, so they spoil your Kundalini.

401
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,270
They make money out of it,
because anybody can sell anything, you see.

402
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:26,238
Anybody can say, ‘I am a Kundalini awakener.’

403
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,690
What can you do about the [fuss?]

404
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:31,746
God is not going to come and arrest you for that.

405
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:35,926
You are arrested, in a way, but that’s a very subtle [UNCLEAR]

406
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:41,444
which nobody understands.
That these are the punishments of our wrongdoing.

407
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:47,332
Those who try to do it in a naïve way can be forgiven.

408
00:35:47,528 --> 00:35:52,723
Even those who make money, I can forgive them,
because this is a silly thing that’s going on everywhere.

409
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:56,815
But those who do it deliberately are definitely the devils

410
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:59,334
– I call them Danavas, Rakshasas.

411
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:02,937
Because deliberately to spoil somebody’s Kundalini,

412
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:09,774
just to entice them, and to hypnotise them to use for
your own purpose, is absolutely Satanic:

413
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,269
is against the purpose of God and that’s
why I’ll call them as the Devil.

414
00:36:14,445 --> 00:36:20,312
So, let us have the experience
– you put your hands towards Me and… [tape fades out]
