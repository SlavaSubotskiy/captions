1
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,610
Today's Puja we have arranged of Durga or
the Kali. That is the destroying form of the

2
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Goddess of all the evil and negativity. This
we had to do it in France, because I feel

3
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:13,050
very strongly that day by day, in general,
France is going down and down and down. While

4
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:21,210
you people are coming up, the rest of the
France is in the most pitiable condition.

5
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:30,810
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church, which - perhaps you are not aware

6
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:39,840
of, perhaps maybe - because you don't read
any other languages, you just read French

7
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:49,170
compulsorily by this country. So you have
no international views or international news

8
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,360
that this Catholic church has done so many
horrible things in the past, that is unbelievable

9
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:12,830
that they have anything to do with God. They
burnt many cardinals in the heart - roasted

10
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:22,740
them.

11
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,900
Not only that, they killed so many people
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

12
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,900
They were much worse than Muslim people. They
went to other countries like South America,

13
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:42,260
America - all these places they're all Catholics
- even our country. And they killed millions

14
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,300
and millions of people.

15
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,
one of the things as I said yesterday is that:

16
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:12,510
you will have to pay for whatever you have
done, on mass scale or individual scale. If

17
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,990
that is the case, then one must know that
France has to pay a lot and this Catholic

18
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:32,130
church has to pay more. Catholic church has
just taken out yarns out of their heads and

19
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,800
started a theory of original sin. That's how
to condemn every other Incarnation, every

20
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,060
other Prophet - that they were all with original
sin. And even they said Mary was born with

21
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,830
original sin, for many popes they were discussing
it.

22
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:00,830
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus religion
of Catholic church had to establish itself

23
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,960
by forcing people, by torturing them, by taking
all their ideas into their own control, give

24
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,280
them funny ideas like original sin. Another
is that you must confess, giving them the

25
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,460
left Vishuddhis. They treated women as nothing
and to Mother of Mary they called Her a woman.

26
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,980
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday, is
a fact.

27
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis to understand
how this Catholic church is so dangerous and

28
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:03,220
has been doing such harm. As there has been
so many books about it - that you people don't

29
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,550
read, because it's not in French. There are
English books from America - you must learn

30
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,240
English. It's very important now I feel, that
all the French must know English, they must

31
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,240
read English. French will not give you the
international personality that you are supposed

32
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:37,170
to acquire. You had some scholarship, not
much. The real scholarship comes from England

33
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:48,060
and also from America in English language,
and also from India. One gentleman who tried

34
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,620
to translate all these things in UNESCO, he
was thrown out by your media. Your media is

35
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,740
taking full advantage that you don't read
any other newspapers; they are doing whatever

36
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,740
they feel like. All kinds of scandals, all
kinds of sensationalization - whatever they

37
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,850
want to write, they write in free press. On
one side there's suppression of natural life

38
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:29,220
of human beings, let them to go to Freud.
Freud is the dirtiest man you can think of,

39
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,600
who has put his ideas into your head. But
as if you are already brainwashed people that

40
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,430
you accepted all that. How could you accept
Freud? If Freud had come to India, they would

41
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,630
have killed him in no time! What happens is
that, somehow or other - I don't know what

42
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,630
is the reason, I don't know where to place
it, but the wisdom is not there. There is

43
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,160
no maturity, there is no wisdom. America I
can understand because it is only two-three

44
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,450
hundred years old. But what about the French?
They have not been able to mature but they

45
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,700
have become extremely frivolous. Maturity
is finished.

46
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:23,700
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young. In India,

47
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:33,370
young people are called as stupid: you call
it gadha pachisi, means in 25 years they are

48
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,910
donkeys. They are never regarded as sensible
people to be followed. And gradually by this

49
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:53,170
movement from Catholic church to Freud, what
has happened that you haven't got your own

50
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,880
personality to understand what is right and
what is wrong. Of course I must say Sahaja

51
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,709
Yogis must have done lots of punyas and must
be very courageous people to be born in this

52
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:14,709
country. Otherwise I don't know how you could
have taken your birth here. The law is so

53
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:22,650
funny that they said it depends on the mood
of the magistrate. (Shri Mataji laughing)

54
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:30,150
You see the magistrate doesn't know the law.
Such a stupid country in modern times I've

55
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,120
never known. Nowhere in the world there's
such a stupid law as it is here. Of course

56
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,120
in America, there is no justice, they do what
they like. But here is so-called modern people.

57
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,520
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law. If you ask them, "What is

58
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,520
the law?" They don't care. It's the mood of
the magistrate. Now supposing he has had a

59
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:06,670
big drink in the last night, second day he
comes with a hangover, so finished. And then

60
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:15,209
he will be very much biased towards the drunkards
only.

61
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:22,470
So here it is becoming such a horrible society
that Indians would be shocked, beyond doubt,

62
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:36,180
but nothing but prostitution. To see and to
be seen. Why? Every woman has to dress up

63
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:51,300
in such a way that she should be attractive,
for what? Is she a prostitute? All kinds of

64
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,520
bathroom cultures developed. For example French
bath, you know what it means, all over the

65
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:15,540
world. It's a very dirty habit of laziness,
it comes because of drinking. If you drink

66
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,100
too much, next morning you are so lethargic
that you take just a French bath and go.

67
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,780
So, please try to remember as French Sahaja
Yogis, that your task is much more difficult

68
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,780
than the task of other countries, because
it lacks complete wisdom. Neither you'll find

69
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,870
in your institutions, nor in your government,
nor in any education. It's lacking wisdom

70
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:01,780
completely. And to have wisdom, according
to these Freudian people, is that you are

71
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:13,569
egoistical! They have such funny ideas from
the yarn of Mr. Freud that no sensible man

72
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:25,250
would accept. But people have lost their senses,
and like blotting paper, whatever is filthy,

73
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:38,490
destructive, horrible, subhuman they try to
absorb. Supposed to be Christian nation.

74
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:
You must get hold of books and find out, where

75
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:02,530
are we? I worked very hard in France, you
know that very well. I used to think, this

76
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,670
is the gate of hell. But it is much worse
than that, it's a mire of filth and you are

77
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:42,080
born here and you have become like lotuses,
so fragrant and beautiful. You'll have to

78
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:59,020
fight it out: I am always with you, all My
powers with you. But remember that you have

79
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,320
to fight the society, you have to save so
many people, you have to rescue them.

80
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:29,710
Children are given liberty, "Do what you like."
They have no sense of liberty! Supposing there's

81
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,540
an aeroplane, which was not fixed properly
and made to fly. What will happen to the aeroplane?

82
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:46,540
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty and the right

83
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,620
sense about themselves, what will happen to
them? Why children are born to parents? It

84
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:14,809
is - to get spoiled, to have liberty or to
get some guidance? You cannot guide your children.

85
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,760
They are so rude, they are so arrogant. They
have gone off, completely. You know for one

86
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,760
month we had to struggle with these western
children and we had come to the point of urge

87
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:10,500
of closing down that school because they were
really violent children, as if coming from

88
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,860
some jungle. Even the jungle animals have
some sense. So you've to think about your

89
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:30,530
children. What's going to happen to your children?
What is going to be their situation? If they

90
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,720
are going to live in the same manner in this
dirt, these children will turn out to be waste,

91
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,710
just a waste! They will have no education,
no character, no personality, they'll end

92
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:24,649
up with AIDS or with drugs or something like
that. I do not see any future for the children

93
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,340
of France, no future.

94
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,340
And you have to fight that, "We want to have
future for our children, we don't want them

95
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:10,260
to be ruined." And you must have courage,
to fight it. It's very important to have courage.

96
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:27,350
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it. And today's Puja is to give that

97
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:45,779
courage in your hearts. See it all around
you, what's happening? You are all nicely

98
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,360
enjoying yourself in the realm of God, (Shri
Mataji smiling) you have entered into the

99
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Kingdom of God. But what about the rest of
the people? The majority of the people, where

100
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:29,770
are they going? What is going to be the future
of this horrible Mooladhara place?

101
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:43,429
Now Freud has been discovered as a fraudulent
man, and now there are books after so many

102
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,320
years, when he has already ruined the people
all over the world. But the worst of all they

103
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,299
have ruined here.

104
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:13,299
It's a responsibility specially of the women
I think, because they are responsible for

105
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:26,419
the society. The society of France has gone
to dogs and for you to now take up upon yourself

106
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:43,049
to talk against this kind of anarchy that
is working out the destruction of your families.

107
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,200
If the women decide, I am sure, they can very,
very easily work it out. Instead of asking

108
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:26,350
for liberation nonsensical, you better ask
for the ascent of this country.

109
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,799
I know I've worked very hard and you are all
there. I am very happy to see that you all

110
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:56,340
are there to fulfill the desires of the Divine.
Because now you should know in a very big

111
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:12,850
way, masses of masses of people will be destroyed.
Not from without but from within. Suddenly

112
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,850
you'll hear so many millions disappear with
this disease.

113
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:34,409
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:
always give yourself a bandhan; always lead

114
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:47,149
a clean life. There are certain hygienic rules
of Sahaja Yoga, please try to follow them.

115
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:01,789
Do not neglect it. If somebody gets AIDS,
you'll not have him in Sahaja Yoga, whatever

116
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:16,429
may be the conditions, whatever may be the
reason. You have to be very careful, also

117
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:28,779
I would say never treat a AIDS patient. Like
the one yesterday who was arguing with Me,

118
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,659
actually because they have only two types
of people: one who are arrogant and another

119
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:50,659
one which always think that it's better they
should die. They have no will to live. So

120
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:08,669
there are only two types of people, either
right-sided or left-sided. And they can never

121
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,880
ascend. We have tried, we have tried, of course
one first one is living for the last seven

122
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:49,830
years, but still. He has no faith in himself.
Maybe next generation might be better on,

123
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:05,779
if they come back. But as far as this generation
is concerned, you should know your responsibility

124
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:14,149
is very great. All the Sahaja Yogis must take
a vow that they'll fight this society and

125
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:23,059
try to save their country and their countrymen
from a complete disaster. There is going to

126
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:30,059
be no war, only they will fight themselves
and die. It's a very serious matter.

127
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:50,539
For that, we decided to have this Puja of
Durga today that all negativity should be

128
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,480
destroyed. So many Deities build up the body
of Kali. Every part of Her body was created

129
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,940
by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is
also, later on, is reflected in you all. So

130
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,070
they say that God has made human beings in
His own image, I would say, I've made you

131
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,850
in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal.
They're all with you, and they have created

132
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,940
you - if you see it minutely - it is the Deities
who have brought forth all the beauty that

133
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,460
you had. They have made all this beautiful
congregation, beautiful transformation, and

134
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:33,380
they have created such angelic people out
of you. They are always working it out, but

135
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:54,190
one thing you have to do is to have the drive.
You had pure desire to ascend, but for what?

136
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:13,870
You want to have the light, but for what?
You want to become gurus, for what? To save

137
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:23,029
people, for their salvation. Only through
your channels I can work out Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,259
If I could work out Myself, I would have.
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

139
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,450
God knows how many there are, rakshasas and
rakshasas. And they are everywhere, even within

140
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,470
you they were. Now they've gone out.

141
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:38,470
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga,
that's very important. I knew the puja would

142
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:45,320
be very late, because Kali's puja is always
done in the night, after twelve. So it had

143
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,179
to be this way. Though last night I slept
at four o'clock and I, tonight, I don't know

144
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:55,179
what am I to do, - it all works out. It's
all worked out. But you have to have deliberations

145
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,429
and you have to think, "What can we do to
change this?" Why not write some books, why

146
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,519
not write some experiences? Get them published
in French only. Let the French know what's

147
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,669
happening outside. Get some of the books translated
- some American books, some English books.

148
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:08,909
At least give quotations from there. How they
are unaware. First this Catholic church has

149
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,360
to go away. It will, no doubt, I am sure about
it. They are literally frightened of us.

150
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,550
And we have to now really show them what we
are capable of. And the funniest thing is

151
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:22,550
that a president has chosen his lady-friend
as the prime minister. I mean, it's not possible

152
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:34,610
in any sensible country. It's never heard
of. I must say, English are thousand times

153
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,560
better. They are really very good. At least,
as far as administration is concerned, as

154
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,370
far as their parliament is concerned, the
justice is not stupid like this, it's based

155
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:56,110
on law, not based on the mood of a magistrate.
How you are still continuing with such stupidity

156
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,450
which are really even before medieval age:
primitive, people are absolutely primitive

157
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:06,450
to accept such laws. At least you can write
a book about the strange laws of French, one

158
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:16,090
title. How it has harmed. There is a very
nice book "Fraudulent Freud". Please read

159
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,040
that, and see how Freud has ruined the French,
how their brains are twisted, how they have

160
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:34,350
twisted ideas. You are also intelligent, clever
people. So if not with the sword, Kali has

161
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,980
to work through the pen.

162
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:45,980
I never knew it was in that bad shape, though
I knew it was. So this is a challenge for

163
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,480
all of us, and let Me see what you can write,
all of you - put together your experience:

164
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,270
how the French parents behave, how the grandparents
behave, what's happening in this country and

165
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,180
all that.

166
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,440
They are living in fool's paradise. They don't
know how destruction is just hanging over

167
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,980
their heads.

168
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Though you are all saved, but you have to
think of others, that is what Sahaja Yoga

169
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,320
is, that is not only that we care for the
bhaktas - like Kali just wanted to protect

170
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,900
the bhaktas, the sadhakas. But you have to
protect many, many more people. You have all

171
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,370
the powers, just assume them and use them.
You can do it. Your media is the worst of

172
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:36,380
all and we can start the newspaper also calling
it anti-media. What can they do to us? Or

173
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,630
some sort of an independent name, we can give
it. And it should be open for people who are

174
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,430
suffering from media sensationalization. They
can write: how the media is harming them,

175
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:42,210
how they are giving false reports and things.
We can! Why not? I am sure it will work out.

176
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,210
Think it over what you can do with your pen.
Whatever you have gained, whatever you are

177
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:49,910
enjoying: beautiful music, all the Pujas,
everything. But think of others. They are

178
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:56,910
already drunk and tossing their heads on their
pillows. Think of them. They, when will they

179
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:08,430
feel this joy? I simply feel pity for them
that they should have taken to all these bad

180
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:16,070
things, because of the suppression of the
Catholic church. It's the Catholic church

181
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,270
which has suppressed them, that's why they
have come to this. No other way - reason why

182
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:17,760
they should accept this kind of thing.

183
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,040
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these things,
we're in the centre. We do not have this kind

184
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,330
of problems, because we don't suppress anyone,
nor do we go to the other extreme of indulgences.

185
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:27,310
I think the whole Europe can be divided into
two types of people: one are Anglo-Saxons,

186
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,720
and others are Latins. Anglo-Saxons are right-sided
and the Latins are left-sided: they cry, weep,

187
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,100
miserable, they indulge into dirt and filth.
Just these two types they are. Now unluckily

188
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,650
you are in the Latin side. So here, Catholic
church is prospering. Now, if you see to the

189
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,200
Latin side and understand to what extent they
have gone to the left side, and getting to

190
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,200
the left side what diseases you get, very
nicely, make a list of them. So what I said

191
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,730
will work out in France: the left-sided incurable
diseases. As it is, you walk on the street,

192
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,490
you find at least three, four mad people,
lunatic people walking, you'll find. Very

193
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:12,490
simple it is. Don't have to go to the lunatic
asylum, on the street! They'll be all talking

194
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,780
and saying things, but it's all there. That's
why they drink, that's why they are miserable.

195
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I do not know what are the statistics of the
diseases.

196
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:36,250
So the problem is extremely grave, very grave.
And you have to work it out, with the gravity

197
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:30,100
of your gurupada which you have asked Me the
other day - you asked for the status of a

198
00:40:59,460 --> 00:40:59,710
guru, for ladies as well as for men. And I
said, "All right, start!"

199
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:06,230
I hope you all have heard the song I've made,
for asking.

200
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,480
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

201
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,490
All right once they will sing that song.

202
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:06,500
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

203
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,800
They will sing that song to you. There are
different request from the Mother, and in

204
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,800
this the last one is that: "Mother, now you
give us the gurupada, the status of a guru."

205
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:36,820
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse the
society in which he lives. It's his duty,

206
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:07,830
he has to fight it. Christ fought it alone,
so many saints fought it alone, they were

207
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:48,870
treated very badly, put in jail, given poisons,
things, but they fought it. In the same way

208
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:31,200
you stand on Truth, and you have to fight
it. Because you are saints.

209
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:54,900
May God bless you!

210
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,920
[Yogis sing: "Vinati Suniye Adishakti Meri".
Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

211
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
They'll repeat it twice, so you can also.
I don't think all of you have heard it, because

212
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:26,930
those who came to Guru Puja must have.
