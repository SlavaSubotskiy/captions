1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,940
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

2
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:57,380
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in
totality - is a reflection of Adi Shakti,

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,430
in totality.

4
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:07,491
Or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,
She’s managing all these three powers, but

5
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:18,050
Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali
in the sense that it is the desire of God

6
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,940
Almighty.

7
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:30,270
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all
the three powers and that's why we can say

8
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:39,789
that when She is in a potential stage, She
is Mahakali.

9
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:54,210
And then She divides Herself into two other
forces as Mahasaraswati and the ascending

10
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:03,120
force that we call, or as a parasympathetic
nervous system expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi,

11
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,729
so She has actually all these forces in Herself.

12
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:17,400
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,
She desires to act and when She wants to act,

13
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,090
Her potential force becomes these two other
forces.

14
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:31,790
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must
understand that inbuilt within this force

15
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:38,660
within us is desire, so we can desire anything.

16
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:49,560
If you want you can desire everything: we
can desire, say, the joy, we can desire the

17
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,909
knowledge, we can desire to be compassionate
and love and we can desire also the destruction

18
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,379
of those which are negative forces.

19
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:07,620
But the Mahakali force is the one which is
working out the constructive force, but in

20
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,099
that constructive force only there has to
be destruction, because if you are constructing

21
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:21,020
something and there is destruction, which
is trying to destroy your construction, then

22
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,659
you have to destroy that destructive person.

23
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:32,650
And this is what people sometimes misunderstand
and they think that Mahakali force is negative

24
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,280
force or is a force of destruction.

25
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,099
It is, but in a very positive way.

26
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,260
And if you understand this part of Mahakali
force then you’ll understand that if you

27
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:56,159
have desires to construct yourself properly
in Sahaja Yoga, then you should also have

28
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,879
the desire to destroy whatever is standing
against your construction.

29
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,750
So one by one, we should see within ourselves
what sort of things that tag us down and thus

30
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,360
they do not give us this desire.

31
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,970
If this desire becomes intense, then you start
immediately seeing what are the forces that

32
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,120
are destroying your ascent.

33
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,320
So we have to ascend is the point.

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,669
Our goal is to ascend, our destination is
to ascend, so our desire should be that we

35
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:47,330
should ascend and construct our being in such
a manner that we can receive all the…

36
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:55,840
Hindi aside
This one is better.

37
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,290
So we should understand that we have to be
prepared to destroy many things within us,

38
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:11,560
if we have to become great evolved personalities.

39
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,370
As you have seen in evolution itself: we had
huge big animals like mammoth, this, that,

40
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,210
and they could not cope with the evolution,
so they were all destroyed - so many things

41
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,919
were destroyed.

42
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,120
And this destruction is built in within us:
when we ascend we just start seeing that these

43
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:46,380
are the forces which we are destroying us
and that our destruction is so much that,

44
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,130
if we do not desire the destruction of these
destructive forces, we’ll be finished.

45
00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,750
So at the same time when we are ascending
higher, we have to know what we have to destroy.

46
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:12,830
For example, even in living forces when a
flower becomes a fruit, lots of things which

47
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:19,320
were the part of the flower get destroyed,
automatically.

48
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:29,610
But that is done in the will of God by his
own understanding, so it's absolutely perfect.

49
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,340
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something,
we must know what do we desire, first fix

50
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,960
your goal and then relate it to that.

51
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:49,020
Now there are many deviations in life, like
you are going to the airport, our attention

52
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,920
should be ‘we have to reach the airport’
and whatever are distractions are distractions,

53
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,240
we should not get lost with it.

54
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,090
If you get lost with those distractions, then
we cannot achieve our goal in time.

55
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:13,819
So one has to understand first of all that
our goal is to ascend and for that the distructions

56
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:19,389
are on our way, because of ourselves, because
of ignorance, because of darkness, because

57
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,539
the light is not so much.

58
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:32,289
The first destroying factor that is within
us is the Shri Ganesha’s power and this

59
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:36,669
Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

60
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:43,000
She first planted Shri Ganesh to emit holiness
on this earth.

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,500
So the whole thing could be vibrated and as
you know one aspect of Shri Ganesh is also

62
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,820
Omkara, means this vibratory awareness which
flows everywhere.

63
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:10,970
So these vibrations have four sites in it:
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

64
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:24,160
auspiciousness through Mahakali power, then
these same vibrations also comfort us through

65
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:33,250
Mahakali power, vibrations do not give you
desires as such, if you see, they do not give

66
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:42,300
you desires, but they give you proof of your
desires being fulfilled.

67
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,000
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this
is your desire and you give vibrations to

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,930
that person, so it’s a means.

69
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:04,449
So it is also the action part which is there
in those vibrations, but this action also

70
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:10,260
comes from desire, if you don’t have desire
you won’t act.

71
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:20,030
So the desire is so important even to establish
your own path, to establish your forward march:

72
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,470
if your desire is poor, if you’re half-hearted,
you can’t work it out.

73
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,000
Half-hearted people cannot achieve anything
in Sahaja Yoga, it's not meant for half-hearted

74
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:46,130
people, it's meant for people who are brave,
who have intense desire, who are intelligent

75
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,579
and who are auspicious.

76
00:09:51,579 --> 00:10:02,189
But in case you do not have intense desire,
then the pure desire doesn't work and you

77
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:05,210
do not get your Realization.

78
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:13,189
Also after getting Realization, unless and
until you have desire to ascend, very strong

79
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:17,500
intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

80
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,900
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to,
first of all, early in the morning, while

81
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,560
taking the name of Ganesha, must say “What
is my desire, this is my goal.”

82
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,850
This is what it is, all activity must be surrendered
for this goal.

83
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,940
So now, how our desires are curbed?

84
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:48,290
First of all, through conditionings, we have
certain conditionings.

85
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:57,020
After Sahaja Yoga, people become very affectionate,
so immediately - even if in the west where

86
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,540
the family is not so important, children not
so important, selfishness is there, people

87
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:12,440
think about themselves only, they cannot think
of others - even in those countries, it starts

88
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:23,270
developing a kind of a, another cocoon of
‘my-ness’: my child, my house, my home,

89
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,840
my family.

90
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,959
Then the attention starts working on that,
you become half-hearted towards your ascent,

91
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:49,620
because you’re ascending in a way, so-called,
and also you are spreading out.

92
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:58,660
Then the concern goes to other conditionings
we have, like the other day I met one fellow,

93
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,770
he said that, “Mother, I am a Sahaja Yogi,
I know, but I can’t get over the idea of

94
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,770
Christ.”

95
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,940
I said, “Who has asked you to get over idea
of Christ?

96
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,799
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,
but understand it in its own comprehensive

97
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,980
way and see for yourself.”

98
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,300
But this conditioning is of thoughts.

99
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:28,350
Supposing, if you have read too many books,
if you have gone through, supposing, you are

100
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:35,280
a born Hindu or a born Christian or a born
Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

101
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,140
You were born as a human being!

102
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,880
You got this stamp later on (Shri Mataji laughing)
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

103
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,760
This stamp you did not carry when you were
born.

104
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,910
Supposing, the child was lost, he could be
any religion.

105
00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:00,250
So these are not really your innate religions,
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian

106
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,620
or anything.

107
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,640
Then you have another conditioning that you
belong to this nation, that nation, like we

108
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:15,569
have, we have America, this, that, that, but
still these are stamps, you were born in America,

109
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:18,040
that's why you are an American.

110
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,190
Anybody who is born in America is not different
from anybody else.

111
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,160
Only thing according to the climate of a particular
place, you might have your complexion, your

112
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,650
height, your face and all that, but that doesn't
mean that innately this is meant for America,

113
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,669
it could be anywhere.

114
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:44,179
Then all this conditionings within us start
acting on our language, on our styles, on

115
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:49,500
our lives in every way, then we start becoming
Americans.

116
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,730
So these are the effects of the outside that
come in us and then we say “We, the Americans”,

117
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:04,670
but if you scratch them, inside body’s the
same, heart is the same, the blood is the

118
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:13,910
same - everything is the same, there’s nothing
different, it's even not skin deep, but in

119
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,120
the brain it has gone that ‘I am an American’.

120
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,699
Then all these things that are in that society,
for example, in America so many things are

121
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,020
allowed, so that's all right.

122
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,730
In India many things are allowed, that's all
right.

123
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,040
Like that we start accepting the society,
the norms of the society and the conditioning

124
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,730
starts.

125
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,049
But with all that this desire is there, the
pure desire to ascend.

126
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:56,430
Aside: I think, you put these lights little
ahead because they are so, paper there and

127
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,920
with My force, light is going behind.

128
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,100
No, no, not that one, please, because they
are facing that fan.

129
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,640
Could bring them down here.

130
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:24,600
Still quite close to that fan you know, you
can put them anywhere, you can put them here,

131
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,169
if you want.

132
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:45,600
You see, because the air is blowing that way
and they are all going that way.

133
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,970
So the desire within us to ascend comes to
us also as a reaction to all these things.

134
00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:02,510
When we see, as Americans, what's happening
to our country, what's happening to the people,

135
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:09,069
what's happening to our surroundings and then
we get a shock, “Oh God!

136
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,990
What is this?”

137
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,000
Then we also see this is artificiality.

138
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,330
Like in England you have to wear a tail coat,
you have to wear this, you have to have this

139
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,640
kind of a spoon, this kind of a glass, this,
that, so reaction builds in.

140
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:34,160
So you start anti-culture, anti-culture to
get rid of artificiality, while the desire

141
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,150
behind is, is to seek the reality.

142
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:44,390
To seek reality, then they have hair just
like primitive people, they live like primitive

143
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,140
people and the reaction is built in.

144
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,860
Behind all that is the same desire, is to
ascend.

145
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:01,230
So this Mahalaxmi power is acting within us,
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can

146
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,939
say, “All right, you want to have, say,
variety of things, go ahead with it.”

147
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:12,970
Then you go crazy, you see, “What's this
going on?

148
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,110
Why should we be so mad about it?

149
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:27,299
” Now they want to have - 

150
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:34,750
you want to have say, your children, your
home, your houses, then you just get fed up

151
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:41,230
with it, because children become arrogant,
they become horrid, they trouble you, then

152
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,230
you say, “Oh God!

153
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,920
I'll never have any children any more.”

154
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,400
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible
and husbands horrible, then you divorce.

155
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,140
You go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't

156
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:04,060
work out, nothing seems to work out, you feel
so frustrated and that action and reaction

157
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,860
works on your desires, so your desires go
on changing.

158
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:20,540
Specially when we are wanting to be affluent,
people become affluent and then they find

159
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:27,930
the problems of affluence, so a reaction is
built in.

160
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:35,560
Those who witness those problems of the rich,
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

161
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,130
So in every way the desire to achieve things
works out, like some people want to have power,

162
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:49,840
they go into politics, fight it, get it done
and done forever.

163
00:18:49,840 --> 00:19:00,250
So, lives after lives it goes on, then you
are born in modern times, when I’m here

164
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:09,890
and now your only strong desire is to become
the Spirit, I hope it is.

165
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:17,899
So now all these back things are to be crossed
over, they are finished.

166
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:25,410
Now what should we do for our Realization,
what action we should take?

167
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:34,840
The first action is to develop your Mahakali
power: by one power you destroy all that is

168
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:44,240
nonsensical, destroy all that is impeding
you, troubling you, blocking you - destroy

169
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:55,640
all that, just I don't want it, because I’ve
seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off, like you

170
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,690
have to go to the airport, suddenly you find
they have fallen into one of the gutters,

171
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,280
“What happened?

172
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,110
“ “Mother, we felt like going there”,
but why?

173
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,120
So keep your attention on that point.

174
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,810
Some people get married - in Sahaja Yoga also
they have a desire to marry, have children,

175
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,010
this thing - but in that also they get fixed
up.

176
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:33,680
Marriage is not the end, it’s just one of
the means to be balanced.

177
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:42,750
So we have to have desire that we have to
achieve something, so go on destroying all

178
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:50,510
that is within us, within us is - there are
six enemies, as they say, is anger, then greed,

179
00:20:50,510 --> 00:21:01,380
jealousies, violence, - all these are within
us, so we have to destroy these six enemies.

180
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:08,870
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that
She destroys all the enemies that stand in

181
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,730
your way, all the rakshasas, all the devils,
all the negative forces, She tries to destroy,

182
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,750
so that your part should be all right.

183
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,140
But while She is destroying all of them, if
you are sticking on to them, what can She

184
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,530
do?

185
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,260
So your desire should be pure and that you
should say that, “All right, we want to

186
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,680
achieve that“, and She is working it out
for you.

187
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:39,270
This is the first thing, Her job.

188
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:45,780
Then the second job is that She comforts,
She gives you comforts - of every kind.

189
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,720
The first comfort She gives you is of your
body: your body becomes comfortable, means

190
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,920
all your diseases and all your troubles are
destroyed, you find that your body becomes

191
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,260
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy
and you can work out your Realization - this

192
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,120
is the first thing She does for you, is to
give you comfort.

193
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:25,230
Then She also gives you comfort of the Spirit,
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

194
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,620
you can live anywhere - you can live in a
jungle, you are comfortable, if you live in

195
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,571
the most busiest place, you are comfortable
- so you are comfortable everywhere and that

196
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:44,140
sort of a comfort She can establish within
you.

197
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:57,320
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She
gives you they joy, joy of every kind, joy

198
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,820
that emits from everything, from everyone.

199
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:10,200
So that is the highest you get when you keep
your desire, the flame of your desire burning,

200
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:22,450
till you reach that state of spiritual attainment,
then you find that no more desire is left,

201
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,610
but only one, if it is any, that let the whole
world be realised.

202
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,370
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy
his drinking with others, like that you become:

203
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,870
you are drunk in your joy and why not others
enjoy, so you work for it.

204
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:47,000
But human beings, I’ve seen, they move like
a yo-yo.

205
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,270
They achieve their spiritual attainment, they
have the joy and then they go back to help

206
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,610
people, they get caught up with them.

207
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:01,740
They are not strong enough, because the Mahakali
power is not strong.

208
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,150
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

209
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:17,930
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced
and in that imbalance you lose your way.

210
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,750
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara
must be fixed properly.

211
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,530
There are so many ways by which you can fix
up your Mooladhara.

212
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:36,870
And you must fix up your Mooladhara first,
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite

213
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,870
moves in the sky.

214
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:44,340
Stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into
any direction to any height, wherever you

215
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:53,402
go, you are quite in charge, you know how
you are moving.

216
00:24:53,402 --> 00:25:00,580
It can bind your attention, everything, so
what we say that the roots are very important

217
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:08,130
first to be established for the growth of
your desire upward like a tree.

218
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:16,090
So they go hand in hand - Mahakali power and
Ganesha's power - go hand in hand, because

219
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,430
that's the foundation.

220
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:26,040
If it is based on that foundation, desires
grow much stronger and stronger and effective

221
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,620
and they do not deviate.

222
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:38,520
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you
reach that state where there's no other desire

223
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:49,780
left but to enjoy, you just enjoy, without
any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

224
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,059
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be
enjoyed.

225
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,880
What is there to talk about it, what is there
to say about it?

226
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,620
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment.

227
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:11,830
And that should happen everywhere and that's
what you are worshipping.

228
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,000
So now I hope you have 108 names of Mahakali,
and if you have the 108 of Mahakali, you will

229
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:27,980
see, one by one, that Her is stages of Her
working out for you, how manifest that you

230
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,950
can see in those names.

231
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:42,830
So now first we'll have a one Atharva Sheersha
and then we can have these 108 names.

232
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,450
Can we?

233
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,020
When he’s here, I’m happy to see you.

234
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,290
We did a Puja there also, Canada also did
it.

235
00:26:54,290 --> 00:39:24,680
I think, it is very important to do Mahakali
power, because that's the first 

236
00:39:24,680 --> 00:41:17,680
power 

237
00:41:17,680 --> 00:42:23,360
that starts manifesting.
