1
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,480
Today, we are all going to worship

2
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
Me,

3
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,800
first time.

4
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,480
It has been always the puja

5
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,800
of aspect of Me or a part of Me.

6
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:49,640
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Adi Shakti.

7
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
As we say, is the pure desire of God Almighty,

8
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,720
of Sadashiva.

9
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,800
But what is the pure desire of God Almighty?

10
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,040
If you see your own desires

11
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
come out of what?

12
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,960
Not of the divine Love,

13
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,040
but out of carnal love,

14
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
out of material love,

15
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,640
out of power-love.

16
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Behind all these desires there is love.

17
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,800
If you do not love something, you will not desire it.

18
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,960
So these mundane type of loves that you have,

19
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,440
for which we spend so much of our time,

20
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,560
uselessly,

21
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,720
actually they do not give you satisfaction,

22
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,000
because that’s not true love that you have,

23
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,160
just infatuation for the time being

24
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,560
and then you just get fed up with it

25
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
and from here you jump to another thing,

26
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,480
to another thing, to another thing.

27
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,840
So Adi Shakti is embodiment

28
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,600
of God’s divine Love.

29
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,320
It’s God’s pure love,

30
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,480
and in His love, what did He desire?

31
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,320
He desired that He should create human beings

32
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
who would be very obedient,

33
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,320
would be sublime,

34
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,480
would be like angels.

35
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,320
And that was His idea, is to create Adam and Eve.

36
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,800
So, angels have no freedom.

37
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,880
Angels are made like that.

38
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,240
They are fixed.

39
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,320
They don’t know why they do it.

40
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,080
Animals also don’t know why they do certain things.

41
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
They just do it,

42
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,480
because they are bound by nature.

43
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,480
They are bound by God Almighty.

44
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,560
They say Shiva is Pashupati,

45
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,960
means he controls all the animals,

46
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,960
He’s Pashupati.

47
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
He controls all the animals,

48
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,400
so all the desires from animals come in,

49
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
but they don’t repent,

50
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,720
they don’t have ego,

51
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,080
they don’t think that this is wrong,

52
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,400
or that is good.

53
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
They have no karma problem

54
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,240
because they have no ego,

55
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,800
because they have no freedom.

56
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,240
At this point

57
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Adi Shakti, which was pure Love

58
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,040
so think of a Father who has put

59
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
all his Love into one personality

60
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,720
then what is left in Him is nothing,

61
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,800
He is just watching.

62
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
Then what does He think,

63
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,480
He is just watching the play of His desire,

64
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,480
of His love.

65
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,800
He’s watching it, how it is working out.

66
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,400
And when He is watching that, then He is very careful,

67
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
because He knows

68
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
that this personality that I have created

69
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,640
is nothing but love and compassion.

70
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,960
And compassion itself is of such a noble variety,

71
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,240
that He cannot bear anybody

72
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,320
challenging that compassion,

73
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
troubling that compassion,

74
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,240
or also in any way demeaning it,

75
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,640
lowering it or insulting it.

76
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
He’s so alert on that point.

77
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,320
And He is very watchful.

78
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,320
So a rift has taken place, we should say,

79
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:41,640
from Him, from His own desire of love.

80
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,880
Now this desire of love was also given a personality,

81
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,240
means ego, and that this ego has to act on its own.

82
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:06,400
It became sort of an, very independent personality,

83
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
which was free, to do whatever it liked.

84
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
I mean we cannot think in our mundane life

85
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,240
that a husband and wife are absolutely free

86
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,960
to do what they like.

87
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,560
Because there is no cohesion,

88
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
there is no understanding,

89
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,400
there is no, not that oneness, that rapport.

90
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,880
But it’s like a moon and moonlight,

91
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,720
sun and sunlight,

92
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,480
it’s such a cohesion,

93
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,720
that whatever one does, another enjoys.

94
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,320
And in that beautiful rift,

95
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,480
Adi Shakti decided to change His plans.

96
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,560
Is known for Her Sankalpa Vikalpa Karoti

97
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,040
anything you try to decide too much,

98
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,480
She will make it break, like today’s eleven o’clock puja.

99
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,960
So when this Adam and Eve business started,

100
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,480
She thought that they will be just like other animals or angels,

101
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,640
what’s the use? They must know what they are doing,

102
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
they must know why they are doing it.

103
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,800
They must have the freedom to understand

104
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,320
what is the knowledge.

105
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,640
And – like fixed machine-like life

106
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,320
that these animals are having –

107
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,640
why should they have?

108
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,640
So, in Her arbitrary power,

109
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,880
which was conceded, of course,

110
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,720
She is the one, who came as a serpent

111
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,400
and told them that “You taste the fruit of knowledge.”

112
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,240
Now for people who are not Sahaja yogis,

113
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,880
you cannot tell this. They’ll be shocked.

114
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,640
But this serpent that came for them to test,

115
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,480
and then to tell them

116
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,200
that “You better taste this fruit.”

117
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,320
This serpent told the woman,

118
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
not the man

119
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
because woman is supposed to accept things easily.

120
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,400
She may even accept bhoots, she may even accept nonsense,

121
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,640
but she’s the one who accepts.

122
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,240
While the man doesn’t accept easily,

123
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,480
he argues, he discusses,

124
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,640
that’s why he came and told the woman

125
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,800
She came and told the woman I should say.

126
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,800
This Holy Ghost actually is a feminine,

127
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,720
and so more nearer to a woman.

128
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,320
This feminine force came as serpent and told

129
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,480
that better you taste the fruit of knowledge.

130
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,560
Now it was the job of the lady,

131
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Eve,

132
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,480
to convince her husband,

133
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,320
because women know how to do that.

134
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Sometimes they may convince them wrongly,

135
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,240
tell them something which is very wrong, very sinister.

136
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
As you know in Macbeth, what happened.

137
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,880
So many places we have seen

138
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,880
women have misguided their husbands.

139
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
But men can be misguided

140
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,240
or could be guided,

141
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,640
or could be emancipated

142
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,040
if they have a proper wife.

143
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,400
So he had all faith in his wife,

144
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,720
believed in it

145
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,240
and they tasted the fruit of knowledge,

146
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,960
under the guidance of this Holy Ghost,

147
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,800
who was a feminine personality of God.

148
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,560
This is … cannot be conceived

149
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,240
by the people who are just getting a glimpse of Christ

150
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
or a glimpse of Mohammed Sahib

151
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,640
or a glimpse of Nanak Sahib.

152
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
They cannot understand.

153
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,240
They just had a glimpse of them.

154
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,480
If they had told, people would have said,

155
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,800
“Bah, what is this?”

156
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,160
They would have never listened to it.

157
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,480
So, at that time, the way the attention was,

158
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,800
the way the reception was,

159
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,560
they told about dharma, about ascent.

160
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,640
But in India people talked about kundalini since long

161
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,400
and that She is the Adi Shakti,

162
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
reflected within us.

163
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,800
Now you see, she’s already read it out to you,

164
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,040
that I will be in every one of them.

165
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,560
Now understand that this Adi Shakti is

166
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,880
the power of Love, of pure Love,

167
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,160
of compassion.

168
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
There’s nothing else She has.

169
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,800
Only the pure Love within Her heart.

170
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,160
But this pure Love is so powerful,

171
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,160
is so powerful

172
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,040
that’s the Love She has given to this Mother Earth.

173
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,560
Because of that this Mother Earth,

174
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,960
the amount of sins we may commit, we may do anything;

175
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,400
She is pouring out Her Love

176
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,240
through these beautiful things to all us.

177
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,560
Now, we have also this beauty expressed

178
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,080
in every way of Her Love

179
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,240
through the galaxies you see, the stars you see.

180
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,160
Now if you want to see it from a scientific way,

181
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,400
then science means it has no love in it,

182
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,720
there’s no question of love.

183
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,640
Even people talk of yoga,

184
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,880
where they don’t talk of love and compassion.

185
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,240
When there is no love and compassion,

186
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,960
there cannot be any divine spark in that person.

187
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:40,720
Everything is completely submerged in this divine Love.

188
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,040
Everything that is created on this Earth,

189
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
everything that is created in this universe,

190
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,320
and universes, and universes,

191
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:58,080
is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother.

192
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,720
So this Adi Shakti’s Love is something so, so subtle,

193
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,640
is so subtle, you cannot understand sometimes.

194
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,320
I know you all love Me very much.

195
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,480
It’s tremendous love for Me

196
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,400
and when I get the vibrations from you,

197
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,480
it’s like the ripples

198
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,040
that reach the shores and again they return back

199
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,520
and lots of little, little sparkling

200
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,960
drops are there on the shore also.

201
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,280
In the same way in My heart,

202
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:54,200
I feel your love echoing the beauty of sparkle

203
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,400
in this divine Love,

204
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,960
which I cannot explain to you the experience,

205
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,040
what it creates.

206
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,880
The first thing that it creates, that tears come into My eyes.

207
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Because it’s the compassion,

208
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,560
which is sandra karuna;

209
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
is, is aadr, it’s not dry.

210
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,320
Like a father’s compassion could be very dry,

211
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,480
“All right, do this, otherwise I’ll shoot you, I’ll do this,”

212
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,880
he’ll speak. Mother will say,

213
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
but She won’t say something that will be that hurting.

214
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,560
She will have to say sometimes, to correct you.

215
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,480
But Her saying is very different from the father’s,

216
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,880
because She has got sandra karuna.

217
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,800
Andr. Aadr is the … which is not dry.

218
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:52,560
And this kind of a heart She developed,

219
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,320
because of this divine Love that She was carrying.

220
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
So every part of Her body,

221
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,320
everything is created out of divine Love.

222
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,720
Every bit of it emits nothing but divine Love.

223
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,040
Vibrations are nothing but divine Love.

224
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,040
Now, as I’ve told you before also,

225
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,880
that this incarnation had to come.

226
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,040
The time had come,

227
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,880
it was all being seen that the time has come.

228
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,400
But there’s a difference between fixed time

229
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,040
and time which is sahaj.

230
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Fixed time is such that you can say

231
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,800
that this train leaves this time

232
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
it will reach this time.

233
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,480
You can say that

234
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,960
some machinery is producing something,

235
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,800
in such and such time it will produce so many things.

236
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,160
But living things, which are spontaneous,

237
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,480
which are sahaj, you cannot say time.

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,560
In the same way this process of freedom;

239
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,400
you have the maximum freedom,

240
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,880
so one could not say what time this will happen,

241
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,240
that people will be available

242
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,160
to receive this subtle knowledge of divine Love.

243
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,120
Knowledge also could be very dry.

244
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,040
We had terrible people in India,

245
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,760
who were busy with the reading

246
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,960
and with the citation of mantras, this, that,

247
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
and they became so dry, so dry,

248
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,400
they’re just bone structures, they were, just bones left.

249
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,320
And so hot-tempered that they looked at anybody,

250
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,480
that person would become into ashes.

251
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I mean, is this the way you have come on this Earth,

252
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,560
to do all the tapasyas, everything,

253
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,960
just to make somebody into ashes?

254
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,080
But that’s how they thought that

255
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,960
they were very great because they looked at somebody,

256
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,040
that person becomes, disappears or becomes ashes.

257
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,600
Bhasmisat they call it.

258
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,640
But there was no idea of benevolence in their heart.

259
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,720
So, the first thing that is achieved

260
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,640
through this divine Love is your benevolence.

261
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,880
Now benevolence itself is also

262
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,160
a kind of a very misguided word.

263
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,960
Benevolence means whatever is good for your Spirit.

264
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,800
Now, as you know the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

265
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,880
so when the Spirit in you starts

266
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,640
reflecting itself in its full beauty

267
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,880
then you become the giver,

268
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,400
you are no more a person who has to take anything,

269
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,480
you just become the giver. You are so fulfilled.

270
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Now, this Advent came at a time which was judged

271
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,400
what time it should come.

272
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,160
As I said you had freedom,

273
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,480
people were going amok, doing all kinds of thing.

274
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,800
So if you see that, just before this

275
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,800
we had a big problem of people working out their power.

276
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,960
Like people will go to India

277
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,440
to occupy the territory of India, or to China,

278
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
or this side they went up to Africa

279
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,080
and all these places.

280
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,560
Even Americans went to – so-called Americans –

281
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,160
went to America and occupied it.

282
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,040
So this was the time when they were using their freedom

283
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,160
for power only.

284
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,720
That was not the time for the Adi Shakti to be born.

285
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,240
They were the people who were power-oriented.

286
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Not that today we don’t have, we have.

287
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,880
But these were seeking only power

288
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,800
and also these territories,

289
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,480
which is not important.

290
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,160
So it could not be at that time.

291
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,320
At that time one had to fight for your freedom,

292
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,240
for getting out of the clutches of these imperialists

293
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,000
and people who were trying to overpower.

294
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,240
Now, gradually it changed.

295
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,040
It changed, and changed in such a smooth way.

296
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,880
Is very surprising,

297
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,800
I saw the change coming up Myself.

298
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,640
It worked out.

299
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,240
As you know that I Myself took part

300
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,480
in the freedom movement of India – is important.

301
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,880
India started, in India it started.

302
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,160
First the freedom, from imperialism,

303
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,720
and then gradually this freedom from imperialism

304
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,880
started spreading in every country.

305
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,880
People started thinking about it,

306
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,320
they started understanding

307
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
that no use having colonies and all that,

308
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,640
better come back to your own position.

309
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,040
So when this happened,

310
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,320
I mean this happened in My own lifetime, I must say

311
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,800
first, people who tried to have freedom in our country died,

312
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,960
so many were killed, you know, we had people like Bhagat Singh.

313
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,480
In every country

314
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,800
all the revolutionaries were thrown out

315
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,560
and were ill-treated and killed.

316
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,920
It’s not question of India only.

317
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,320
But that one had to go through.

318
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,160
So their freedom was tested.

319
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,240
Now they thought this was nonsensical thing we did,

320
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,960
this was no freedom.

321
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,720
Because after all, doing all that, then they started repenting

322
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
and developing a kind of a fear

323
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,880
and a fright from others

324
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,960
and kind of a, what you can call,

325
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,480
a very disturbed Left Visshuddi started.

326
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,800
They felt that … very guilty,

327
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
that they have done very wrong,

328
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
they should not have done it.

329
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,800
At this juncture also

330
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,800
there were other problems,

331
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
like we had caste-systems

332
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,320
and other problems in slavery

333
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,880
and all kinds of things, disparities,

334
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,400
and some people were treated as lower people,

335
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,880
some as higher people, some higher races, some lower races,

336
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,480
all these stupid things were there.

337
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,880
Through their freedom they have created this,

338
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,080
through their freedom.

339
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,720
It’s not so, it’s not, it’s not the fact, it’s not the truth.

340
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,080
But they created a thing like that.

341
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Now supposing I want to create something here,

342
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,560
just to say, that “All right, this is not a carpet,”

343
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,160
go on telling you, “It’s not a carpet, it’s not a carpet.”

344
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
The brain is washed, you see, you think all,

345
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,480
“It’s not a carpet, must be something else.”

346
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
It’s like a mesmeric thing I feel,

347
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,000
the way people accepted this nonsense of racialism,

348
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,600
of all kinds of disparities, of slavery,

349
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,080
of caste-system and specially ill-treating women.

350
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,040
All this came out of the choice that was given to them

351
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,400
to select what is good, what is bad.

352
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,040
So to them it was very good, you see,

353
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,920
it was a nice thing to do.

354
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,240
Under these circumstances,

355
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,720
compassion would have been wasted on these people.

356
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
Divine Love would have been a waste on them.

357
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,960
Because mentally people were not prepared to understand;

358
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
you could not tell them

359
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
that this is absolutely out of your blindness,

360
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
ignorance, you are doing this;

361
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
this is not the right thing for you,

362
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,000
this will not make you noble;

363
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,120
this is ignoble, you are doing ignoble things.

364
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
Of course so many saints came,

365
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,080
they talked of nobility, of forgiveness,

366
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,480
of unity, of oneness, everything they said.

367
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,320
Big seers were born,

368
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,960
they also reached that point to talk about it.

369
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
But still people were not prepared so much.

370
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,720
Gradually I think their teachings and all that

371
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
started working in people.

372
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,800
But the biggest problem came

373
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,320
with these so-called religions that they started.

374
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,480
These – all religions got derailed.

375
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,800
And they formed kind of puddles, you see,

376
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,920
Muslims here, Christians here, Hindus there,

377
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,880
this is this, this is this.

378
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,960
So you really needed this giver of life

379
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,720
to fill up all these puddles

380
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,240
and make them one.

381
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,640
It’s complete ignorance, is sheer stupidity,

382
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,560
to think that one human being is higher than another.

383
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,240
You can only say one thing,

384
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,320
that at a different state you are.

385
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,080
Some are at a different state,

386
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,040
some are at a higher state,

387
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
but in general you cannot condemn somebody

388
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,160
that he is no good, this society is not good,

389
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,240
this society is … in general!

390
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Individually you can say,

391
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,920
in general you cannot say.

392
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,120
But this ignorance was so dark,

393
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,480
because it became collective,

394
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,680
it’s a collective ignorance. Collective ignorance!

395
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,160
They all joined hands together, collectively,

396
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,480
to say that this is the religion that is the best,

397
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,560
we are the only ones which are saved ones.

398
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,640
Another said, “No no no no no no,

399
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,160
these are absolutely condemned people, we are the best.”

400
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,560
And under the name of religion,

401
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:29,240
under the name of God Almighty, they started this nonsense.

402
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,480
So now, Adi Shakti had to assert,

403
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,320
put the complete force.

404
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,880
So, the first thing She realized,

405
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,640
that one should know what is a family.

406
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,040
A child grows in the family

407
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,160
if the children do not get the proper attention

408
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,640
from the father or mother

409
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,520
we can say if they are also spoilt,

410
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,720
or if not spoilt, if they are overindulged into,

411
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,040
or they are neglected,

412
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,320
then the child doesn’t know what love is.

413
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,480
If a child doesn’t know what love is

414
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,160
love doesn’t mean that you spoil the child,

415
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,160
or you give him lots of toys to play and get rid of him

416
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,800
it means that all the time your attention is on your child.

417
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,480
And that attention is not indulgence,

418
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,960
but an attention for the benevolence of the child.

419
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,160
So all the time you are seeing that there is benevolence.

420
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,320
And thus, I thought the family life has to be,

421
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
first of all substantiated.

422
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,480
It’s very important,

423
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,640
because these days also under the name of religion

424
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,720
they have started nunneries and then priests

425
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,960
and then sanyasis and all kinds of babas are there.

426
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,480
They are so dry!

427
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,560
And they are so misleading to people,

428
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,960
that people started taking to this kind of sanyasa,

429
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,880
getting out of their houses,

430
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,480
running away from their wives, their children.

431
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,040
So the first point I realized,

432
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,160
human beings cannot have love

433
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,040
who haven’t known what is love is.

434
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:46,520
And this love is more effective if it is collective.

435
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,480
See we, you must have seen that in India

436
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,240
people really love each other in a family.

437
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
I mean so many relations we don’t know

438
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
how we are related to them,

439
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,560
we just call them brother, sister, this, that.

440
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,480
We don’t know what is the relationship is,

441
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,120
so whose father was, whose sister, nothing.

442
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,640
But we just feel this is our brother,

443
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,480
and if you ask how is your brother you wouldn’t know how is your brother.

444
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,320
The reason is we had joint family system,

445
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,320
the joint family system just like a collective system.

446
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,720
So nobody knew who was whose real brother,

447
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,320
who was his step-brother, who was his cousin, nothing.

448
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:34,520
They all lived together as just relations.

449
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,640
But then this also broke,

450
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
this joint family also broke

451
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,800
because of economic reasons and things like that,

452
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,160
whatever it is.

453
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,520
So now at this time when … see these … very crucial time it was,

454
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,160
when the people had to know love

455
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,040
and the family had started breaking in every country;

456
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,720
specially say Western countries,

457
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,320
for men and women never realized

458
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,560
the importance of family life.

459
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,320
They never had faith in their family life.

460
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,320
So it became such a shifty thing for poor children,

461
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,080
they were on shifting grounds

462
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,960
and they couldn’t grow properly.

463
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,880
So they created a generation of violent,

464
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,440
horribly possessed children.

465
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,480
This generation then went into war-mongering;

466
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,160
they don’t know, they feel like fighting.

467
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,480
I have seen children fighting with a tree.

468
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,560
I said, “Why are you fighting?”

469
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,400
“It’s nice to fight, you know.”

470
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
But why are you fighting they don’t know.

471
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,960
The reason – there is no love.

472
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,080
So everything that you see you detest,

473
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,840
“I don’t like it, I don’t like it,” detest everything.

474
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,480
You try, out of your frustration,

475
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,040
to destroy anything that you see.

476
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,080
So a new trend started.

477
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,160
Apart from the war, when it was over,

478
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,480
naturally the value system dropped out.

479
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,160
People felt, “What’s the use, you see,

480
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,400
we had all these values, so what did we get?

481
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,880
War and war, what is the war,

482
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,160
for war has just killed all our societies,

483
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
they have killed our children, everybody

484
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,160
and what is the great about this war also?”

485
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,080
So the mind of the people on the whole was that,

486
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:40,160
you see, somehow or other, you must fight.

487
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,160
Like the fittest man is the best,

488
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
so the one who can dominate,

489
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,040
the one who can come up is the best.

490
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,640
So the domination of this imperial style

491
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,240
of government was over,

492
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,240
but individually it became a process of domination.

493
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,320
And with this process of domination ego started developing.

494
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,720
Even to children they used to give a education

495
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,240
in such a way that children became very arrogant.

496
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,960
Very artificial, extremely arrogant and artificial.

497
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,720
It was impossible to understand

498
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,880
why these children were not at all controlled,

499
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,960
were told that “This is wrong.”

500
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,960
Because the parents also took a very, very defensive attitude.

501
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,360
They would not face their children

502
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
and tell them what is wrong.

503
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,120
They were so attached to that idea

504
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,800
that these children will leave us,

505
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,040
that they said, “All right, do what you like, but stay with us.”

506
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,240
Under these circumstances even human beings as such

507
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,720
were dwindling between a good family life

508
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,800
and divorces and a funny society,

509
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,600
which believes in sharing women or sharing men

510
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,560
and all kinds of things.

511
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,040
So what a terrible situation was there for Adi Shakti

512
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,400
to assert Herself.

513
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,480
Then also there was very big problem

514
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,400
about these religions asserting themselves,

515
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,480
their own ideas, their own conditionings on people

516
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,080
and absolutely blinding them.

517
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,640
So it was a turmoil,

518
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,880
it was a turmoil and at this turmoil-state only,

519
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,720
Adi Shakti had to come to establish the dharma.

520
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,200
She had to work it out to establish the dharma.

521
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,400
It was a very shifty place, very shifty sands were there.

522
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,560
But when I was born, I was shocked the way people were.

523
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,160
At that time, I don’t think I met many seekers.

524
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
Of course I met one or two realized souls,

525
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,160
but mostly they were worried about their insurance,

526
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,760
their money, their this, that.

527
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,280
Mean if you talked to them, I mean, not know

528
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,800
where have you come, into some wilderness or what?

529
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
You didn’t know what to talk to them.

530
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,960
How could you start telling them about divine Love,

531
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,960
when they were not seekers even.

532
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,040
Then, gradually,

533
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,720
I felt confident.

534
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,400
First I thought I have come little early,

535
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
I should have waited slightly more,

536
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,880
would have been better,

537
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,320
because here the people hate everyone,

538
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,720
and every individual is against another individual,

539
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,320
and they are cheating each other

540
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,080
and they are also very jealous of each other

541
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,560
and also want to have higher positions and this and that.

542
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Or others, they want to pull everybody’s legs.

543
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,080
So, maybe that there’s no yet time

544
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,040
for Sahaja Yoga to start.

545
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,960
But then I saw all these horrible false gurus also

546
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,640
throwing their own charms on people,

547
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,760
and trying to control them.

548
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,160
That made Me really, really think

549
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,880
that now I better stop worrying as to what the atmosphere is,

550
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,960
worrying as to what sort of people there are

551
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,800
let’s start.

552
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,720
And that’s how the first Brahmarandra Chhedan

553
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:52,720
took place in India. That’s 5th May.

554
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,040
And – 1970, 5th May, in the morning time,

555
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,720
of course it had some, also some events

556
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,320
which made Me hurry up to do it.

557
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,400
I was quite ready, I knew what was the problem of human beings is,

558
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:17,240
but I thought that, maybe, they may never accept

559
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,040
that they can get their Self-realization.

560
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:30,640
Now this incarnation is really a very unique type.

561
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,240
So many incarnations came.

562
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,800
They came, told you everything, like words,

563
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,880
and said this is good, this is good, this is good.

564
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,720
Some people, who were enamored by them, followed them.

565
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,240
But nothing was inside their heart,

566
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
whatever they heard, all right,

567
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,160
it’s a sermon, it’s a lecture, it’s a Gita, that’s all.

568
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,640
And the life of such a person

569
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,040
didn’t have that spark of the divine Love

570
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,160
within that person.

571
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,640
We have had lots of good people

572
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,240
during this short time if you see.

573
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,240
If you see, Mahatma Gandhi was there,

574
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,960
Martin Luther was there.

575
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,160
All kinds of people you see all over,

576
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,080
Abraham Lincoln was there, George Washington was there.

577
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,640
We have … William Blake was there, we had Shakespeare.

578
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,640
All this, this time, you see, in the literature, in every way

579
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,720
Lao Tse, then we had Socrates.

580
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,560
Start from Socrates to today,

581
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
we have had lots of philosophers, lots of people,

582
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,040
who talked about higher life.

583
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,880
Despite that,

584
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,720
people were thinking these are some absurd people,

585
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,440
there’s nothing in it, too much to understand.

586
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,560
Nobody would read anything about, say, Guru Gita,

587
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,240
they would not.

588
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,880
They would think that “What’s this nonsense,

589
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,160
what’s the use, is all humbug going on,” like that.

590
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,240
With this attitude, you see, you find all around,

591
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,040
when I looked, “Oh,” I said, “Wah, how am I to tell them,

592
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,280
what you are, what they are, and what they have to find?”

593
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,640
And it was really My desire

594
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,480
that there should be some keenness in people,

595
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,720
just little bit, if they gave Me a little chance,

596
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,400
this divine Love is so subtle,

597
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,640
it will just penetrate into their hearts.

598
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,560
But they would not, they were just like stones.

599
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,800
You couldn’t talk to them, you couldn’t tell them about anything.

600
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,800
And they thought no end of themselves, that’s the worst part of it.

601
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,640
Under these circumstances Sahaja Yoga started.

602
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:15,240
And there I find that the powers of Adi Shakti

603
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,920
are much greater than the problems, you see.

604
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,480
I saw it very clearly Myself,

605
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:32,160
because these powers are awakening the kundalini.

606
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,640
I knew I can awaken the kundalini, no doubt, I knew that.

607
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,960
And also knew that I can do it en-masse, realization.

608
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,720
But I could never think that people whom I awakened

609
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,120
will come back, again, because,

610
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,800
you see, they are ignorant people.

611
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
I never thought that they’ll come back,

612
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,080
they’ll practice Sahaja Yoga or they’ll go to this level.

613
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,040
Never, never, never, never thought.

614
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,640
If somebody had told Me I would have laughed at that person.

615
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,080
Exactly what happened was that when I gave the first lecture,

616
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,040
anywhere, that hall would be finished,

617
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,800
everything would be finished, and nothing to do with that hall,

618
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,080
I was staying somewhere else, it was …

619
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,760
the hall was taken on hire,

620
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,560
and follow-on, of course, very few.

621
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,160
So I thought that, you see, doesn’t go into their heads,

622
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,600
just goes over their head, I think.

623
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,960
They don’t want to understand anything.

624
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,320
They did not understand anything.

625
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,320
Under the great pressure, you see

626
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,720
I had the family problems, this, that.

627
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,160
That was not so important. The most important thing was,

628
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:50,480
that how to penetrate into human mind.

629
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,880
So the only solution was to raise their own kundalini;

630
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,520
to create that little light in them.

631
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,800
Because if I go on, sitting down

632
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,320
with the idea that they’ll come around and ask Me

633
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,880
for kundalini awakening and

634
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,200
then I will awaken them – was a wrong idea.

635
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,160
I could realize that.

636
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,560
So en-masse realization started.

637
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,160
And this really surprised people.

638
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,960
It was no magic,

639
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,320
it was not story telling, but it was the truth.

640
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,840
They could feel it on their fingertips,

641
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,880
they could feel it

642
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,160
out of their fontanel-bone area.

643
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,320
It’s the actualization of Sahaja Yoga

644
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,880
has worked the wonders.

645
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,480
Otherwise, it would have been impossible.

646
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,400
All these wonders that you see today

647
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,720
are because your – your reaction,

648
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,480
because the way you reacted, the way you received it.

649
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,280
Otherwise, Adi Shakti is what? Good for nothing.

650
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,280
If you do not accept, I’m nothing.

651
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:15,240
Actually it is again, I say, your wisdom,

652
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,800
your sense, your – your seeking

653
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,160
has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,960
I never write letters to anybody,

655
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,160
I never call anybody, that you know all gurus do that,

656
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,960
as soon as they go to any city,

657
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,160
they write it down the names of all the important people

658
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,320
and then they send them letters,

659
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,960
and get about two, three at least for such programs.

660
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,240
But without doing all that, you see,

661
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,960
how we have managed this en-masse kundalini awakening,

662
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,720
by which people started understanding Sahaja Yoga.

663
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,480
It started penetrating into them.

664
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,400
Now for that, I have to raise My own Kundalini like that.

665
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,640
Every time, in a public program, I raise Mine also.

666
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,240
And in My Kundalini itself I catch all your problems.

667
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,320
It’s painful; that’s why after puja

668
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,800
I become very, sort of … like a stone, I should say, for a while.

669
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,160
Reason is I’m absorbing all that is within you.

670
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,640
Like I’ve put you all in My body.

671
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,720
You are parts and parcel of My body.

672
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,080
Every cell that I have, is for you, for your abode.

673
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,480
And you have to be that subtle

674
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,640
to understand that if we own something,

675
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,800
or if we have something to be done about Sahaja Yoga or anything,

676
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,040
if we want to start an ashram, or anything,

677
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,840
immediately I know.

678
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,080
How do I know is because you are inside Me.

679
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,960
Most of the things I know very clearly.

680
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,560
But some of these things I don’t know that clearly

681
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,880
because of one thing.

682
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,720
The relationship between you and Me

683
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,160
is of course very intimate,

684
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,800
that you should be in My body,

685
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,240
but if you people are not meditating

686
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,400
is very mundane thing I must tell you – Dhyanagamya

687
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
if you are not meditating,

688
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,160
then I have no relationship with you.

689
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,040
You are not My relation.

690
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,960
You have no right on Me.

691
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,880
You have no question to be asked,

692
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,240
why this is happening, why that is happening.

693
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,480
So if you do not meditate – I always say meditate, meditate

694
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,080
I have nothing to do with you.

695
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,640
Are no more there for Me.

696
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,800
It has no connection with Me.

697
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,880
Then you are like all other people.

698
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,320
You may be Sahaja yogis,

699
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree

700
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,040
from your leaders maybe, I don’t know,

701
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,720
and maybe that you are regarded as something very great.

702
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,200
But, if you do not do your meditation

703
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,640
every day, evening, morning or evening,

704
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:45,240
you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji.

705
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,320
Because the connection is only through gyana,

706
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,800
through meditation.

707
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,160
I have known people who do not do meditation.

708
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,480
Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens;

709
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,400
then they start coming and telling Me.

710
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,400
But I see clearly that the person is not meditating,

711
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,640
I have no relationship with him.

712
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,440
He has no right to ask Me anything.

713
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,800
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

714
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,160
But once you will know what is meditation is,

715
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,640
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

716
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,480
how we can have a rapport with each other.

717
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,320
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

718
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,240
like writing letters or maybe some sort

719
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,400
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

720
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,720
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

721
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,160
In meditation you grow.

722
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,400
In that spiritually you become higher.

723
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,320
And when that happens, you start,

724
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,960
in a way, I would say

725
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,640
that when you reach a state of

726
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,560
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

727
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,560
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

728
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,760
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

729
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,720
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

730
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,800
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

731
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,400
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

732
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,720
Then I’m responsible for you,

733
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,560
for your children, for everyone.

734
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,480
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

735
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,240
to save you from all your negativity.

736
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,520
So it’s not like a father

737
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,640
who will directly punish you,

738
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,640
it’s not that, but it’s just

739
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,400
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

740
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,160
That’s the only thing that can happen.

741
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,560
If you are not meditating, all right,

742
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,160
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

743
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,640
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

744
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,160
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

745
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,480
you cannot have without meditation.

746
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,080
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

747
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,400
please meditate every day.

748
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,240
But I think people are also not understanding

749
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,800
the importance of what I am saying,

750
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,240
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

751
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,240
“Why?”

752
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,640
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

753
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,560
Now this instrument is fully made,

754
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,400
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

755
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,080
what’s the use of having it.

756
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,240
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

757
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,240
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

758
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,800
a complete panorama changes.

759
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,400
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

760
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,560
a very different temperament,

761
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,080
a very different life and he lives always

762
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,160
in complete satisfaction with himself.

763
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,960
So today as being the first day, as you say,

764
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,400
of the Advent, say, we can say that it is the first day

765
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,320
when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today

766
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,040
of course it was not today, but still we can say that if that is so.

767
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:43,040
If it has happened and it has been helpful to you,

768
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,400
it has been a great blessing to you,

769
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,080
then must know how to preserve it,

770
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,320
must know how to enhance it,

771
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,800
must know how to enjoy it.

772
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,840
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

773
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,240
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

774
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,640
But you should have a full oneness

775
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,080
with the Divine, full oneness.

776
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,640
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

777
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,520
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

778
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,800
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

779
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,400
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

780
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,240
or that time we want to see the watch.

781
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,400
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

782
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,960
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

783
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,960
but that’s only in the beginning.

784
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,240
But gradually you will be all right.

785
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,800
Gradually you will master it.

786
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,040
Gradually you will know it so well

787
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,400
that you would not like to have anything else

788
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,040
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

789
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,880
You see, so to get to your beauty,

790
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,400
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

791
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,040
which is now exposed,

792
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,480
only thing you have to do really religiously

793
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,080
is to meditate.

794
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,320
That’s not that “Tonight I came very late so I need not meditate.

795
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,800
Tomorrow, you see, I have to go for work

796
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,320
so I cannot meditate.”

797
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:33,160
Nobody wants to know the excuses. It’s between you and yourself.

798
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,320
It is your gain, nobody else’s.

799
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,040
It’s for your gain everything is happening.

800
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,560
Now one has to know

801
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,240
that we have achieved a certain height of evolution.

802
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,800
And from this height you might go up to here, up to here,

803
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,400
up to here. I’m not saying it’s not possible to do that.

804
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,320
But, first and foremost thing, that whatever you may be,

805
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,240
may consider you to be a very high-class Sahaja yogi,

806
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,120
you have to be humble about meditation.

807
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,720
This meditative quality …

808
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,720
even when I’m talking to you, it’s just, I am getting into it,

809
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,240
because it’s so joy-giving.

810
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,400
You just jump into the ocean of joy.

811
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,400
First, it will be difficult,

812
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,320
but after some time you will know that this connection

813
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,160
that you have with Shri Mataji

814
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,840
is the only connection that you were looking out for.

815
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:51,640
And also there is another point people get lost with,

816
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,160
which I have seen very common

817
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,000
with some people who get lost.

818
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,640
They meditate individually, very much, it is very correct.

819
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,240
Individually they will meditate.

820
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,880
And they will sit down, meditate, we do puja, we do …

821
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,800
But collectively they will not meditate.

822
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,680
So this is another point one has to remember,

823
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,560
that you have to be collectively meditating.

824
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,600
Because I am a Collective Being of all you.

825
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,880
And when you meditate collectively, you are really very close to Me.

826
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,640
So even if you have a program or something,

827
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,480
you must do some meditation with it.

828
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,720
Always have meditation as the priority for any program.

829
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,560
You sing the songs, is over, everything is done, then you meditate.

830
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,160
If I’m insisting on something,

831
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,800
you must know that this must be the truth I’m telling you,

832
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,160
absolutely the basis of it,

833
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:03,840
though it looks rather mundane, but it’s very important.

834
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:12,640
Now for us to worship Adi Shakti,

835
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,680
I don’t know, or, because there has been no,

836
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,880
no prayers or anything about Adi Shakti.

837
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,640
Up to Bhagawati they have gone,

838
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,840
but beyond Bhagawati they have not gone.

839
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,800
So I don’t know what sort of pujas you will have,

840
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:40,240
but let’s try something, maybe.

841
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,800
I think the meditation is the best way

842
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,800
we can really achieve something,

843
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,440
so we can go into meditation for about five minutes.

844
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,360
Please close your eyes.

845
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:55,320
Eleven Rudras are awakened

846
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,480
and they will destroy all that is negative.
