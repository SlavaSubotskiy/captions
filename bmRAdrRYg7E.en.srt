1
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:52,065
I believe you all say these things,

2
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:58,428
and you listen to it,

3
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,419
and you say it from your heart.

4
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:19,823
Only the one who are united with God can worship Shri Ganesha.

5
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:26,271
And Shri Ganesha worships your Mother.

6
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
First of all

7
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:46,571
one must to understand

8
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:52,184
that there is a combination of a Mother and a Guru.

9
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:57,634
Because Guru is a very hard task master.

10
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,410
He does not allow any liberties to be taken.

11
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:07,475
And Mother is very kindly.

12
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:17,395
But you don't have feelings for the Mother, do you?

13
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,931
Is it all a lip-service that you listen,

14
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,942
goes into your head, and you think you have become

15
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,020
the surrendered Sahaja yogis?

16
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:47,421
Like all Islam people believe they are surrendered to God,

17
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,472
like Christians believe they are surrendered to God.

18
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:55,253
It's just a lip-service that you are this, you are that.

19
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:01,008
Or do you know it him, what is He said, is a fact.

20
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,845
Have you not seen the Sun in my hand?

21
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:09,445
What more proof you want?

22
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:36,316
Anybody who misleads you is of course sinful no doubt,

23
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,974
but to fall a trap to such a person!

24
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:48,397
If you had told a child that the Mother is coming, he would have fought,

25
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:49,684
"I'm going".

26
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,144
He would have cried and wept.

27
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,126
What about your vibrations?

28
00:32:03,345 --> 00:32:05,345
You don't use your vibrations?

29
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,920
You have come all the way for Guru Puja here,

30
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:13,293
who is your Guru? Whom are you going to worship?

31
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:19,367
Anybody comes from anywhere becomes suddenly important. How?

32
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,590
It was never done before,

33
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:32,144
first time I see such a horrible thing.

34
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:38,595
In my living time if you are doing like this, after my death so many gurus will rise,

35
00:32:39,552 --> 00:32:40,237
to mislead you.

36
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,539
Are you going to accept all that?

37
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:14,877
All the Deities refused for me to do this.

38
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:18,632
They tortured my life, they would not accept

39
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,289
to allow you to have the Puja. Absolutely, nothing doing.

40
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,834
Because they love me, they respect me.

41
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,334
They have the proper protocol.

42
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:36,391
They don't want to become gurus themselves,

43
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,891
and misbehave in this manner.

44
00:33:55,106 --> 00:34:01,291
Last time when I came I really was very strong, with the French.

45
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:10,715
I've told so many times that France is the Hell of the Universe.

46
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:21,615
And you should fall a trap to something like that?

47
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:26,357
It's very supra-conscious, extremely supra-conscious.

48
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:28,912
And arrogant.

49
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:44,047
I've never known of such a Guru Puja. Never.

50
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:48,745
Indians had only one Guru Puja, and they are praying that

51
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:51,832
they should have at least one more Guru Puja.

52
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:56,730
With all these Guru Pujas if you have achieved this kind of surrendering,

53
00:34:57,285 --> 00:35:00,021
it's better you do not have any more Guru Pujas at all.

54
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:03,304
Don't deserve it. You cannot become Gurus,

55
00:35:03,804 --> 00:35:05,074
I can see that clearly.

56
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,570
Without surrender how will you?

57
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:46,081
All the Blessings of the Divine

58
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,246
have been showered upon you.

59
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:54,042
And what have you given back?

60
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:01,937
Such ego?

61
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:05,688
That you act to somebody because he has greater egos?

62
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:27,361
It is a very bad example.

63
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:38,181
You have to wash the feet of the Indians and drink that water.

64
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:41,809
May be then you might realize where you are.

65
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,503
You may be very developed and all that.

66
00:36:45,722 --> 00:36:47,722
And the Indians who are of your type,

67
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:51,301
all of them have to do that.

68
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:01,354
Why didn't you see your vibrations?

69
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,998
When the blind gets his eyes, he doesn't close his eyes to see things, does he?

70
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,648
And what has happened to your leaders also?

71
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:25,189
All of them put together could not

72
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:27,689
say that we will not have this nonsense at this time?

73
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:42,850
Just coming to the airport, so many people have risen higher in life.

74
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,080
What are you doing here?

75
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,679
You should have protested.

76
00:37:56,581 --> 00:38:00,207
I would like to know how many wanted to go to the airport and asked for it.

77
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:02,427
Raise your hands. Honestly.

78
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,384
Honestly.

79
00:38:18,328 --> 00:38:20,328
These are the only people who love me.

80
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:25,454
May God Bless you.

81
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:49,143
Tomorrow somebody tells you to insult me, will you do that?

82
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:04,717
You know that if a king arrives from a small little place somewhere,

83
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:09,801
or a prime minister from a very small island,

84
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,752
from lardy and muddy island

85
00:39:17,252 --> 00:39:18,454
the prime minister came,

86
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:23,057
and the prime minister of England had to go receive him.

87
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,974
And if your Guru has come,

88
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:36,077
all the gurus have to come to receive me,

89
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,829
or to listen to something nonsensical here?

90
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:47,996
I felt like going back from the airport only,

91
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:50,496
the kind of vibrations I felt.

92
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,093
How do you get into this kind of a maya?

93
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,496
How you join hands? Except for a few.

94
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:17,561
“Your quality will be known:

95
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,296
how much you are surrendered to Me".

96
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,702
Christ has said that.

97
00:40:30,249 --> 00:40:31,980
And today I say to you that.

98
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,208
On all other things Sahaja yogis will protest.

99
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,101
"This was not good, that was not good, this was done”.

100
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,667
Against each other, against everything they will protest.

101
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:53,244
"Sahaja yogi took this much money from us, and

102
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,281
this should not have happened," they always tell me.

103
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,051
Complaints and complaints, and complaints, and complaints!

104
00:41:04,873 --> 00:41:08,964
And for this kind of a nonsense they have no protest, nothing!

105
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:22,352
You are all ego-oriented people and you like

106
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:24,571
egoistical supra-conscious nonsense.

107
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:25,940
That's what it is.

108
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,343
You have all come for Guru Puja or for what have you come for?

109
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:39,361
It is beyond me.

110
00:41:45,272 --> 00:41:48,513
This I'm talking to you as your Mother, and not as your Guru.

111
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:53,030
As a Guru I’ll do what I have to do.

112
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:58,596
I'm talking to you as a Mother. Is this the way to respect Her?

113
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,315
I told you, this is the last Guru Puja you'll be having,

114
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,815
the last Puja you will be having, perhaps may be.

115
00:42:17,886 --> 00:42:19,886
It's shocking!

116
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:33,308
You have to respect your Guru.

117
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:34,938
Surrender to your Guru.

118
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:38,497
It is said that the Guru is

119
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:42,220
the Param Chaitanya, but it is: the Param Chaitanya itself is your Guru.

120
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:54,309
"Agata Parama Chaitanya, Dhanyoham Tava Dharshan -

121
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:58,760
When the Param Chaitanya itself will come on this earth,

122
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:01,689
I will feel myself so gratified

123
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:04,108
to see the darshan of that Maya.

124
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,958
In what world are you living?

125
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,427
Where are you?

126
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:14,521
Taking for granted?

127
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,160
I know Mother has a right to punish you, very well.

128
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,089
Even Krishna could be punished by His Mother.

129
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:38,381
But I'm not interested.

130
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,591
The children who want to disrespect me,

131
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,727
and insult me, I have nothing to do with them.

132
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,421
They have no love for me, I have nothing to do.

133
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:03,207
Only those

134
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:07,667
who protested and wanted to go to the airport should come forward to do my Puja.

135
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:12,902
Honestly.

136
00:44:21,957 --> 00:44:23,529
You should be ashamed of yourself.

137
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:30,370
You have insulted your Mother, who has given you Realization,

138
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,307
who has done so much for you. Selflessly I've been working

139
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:36,203
day in and day out,

140
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:44,451
neglecting my own children, my own family,

141
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:46,919
my grandchildren.

142
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:48,444
For you?

143
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,145
Only those people who wanted to go to the airport

144
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,228
and said, and did not go, please come forward.

145
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:20,062
Please.

146
00:45:35,455 --> 00:45:35,895
Come.

147
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,513
He is meeting Me after so many years.

148
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:50,187
When did you come?

149
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:54,947
Just imagine,

150
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:57,715
they come all the way from here and there, and there.

151
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:00,549
And nicely you are telling them to listen to some nonsense?

152
00:46:01,496 --> 00:46:03,913
They have not come here to listen to anybody’s nonsense.

153
00:46:17,189 --> 00:46:19,189
Come forward, this side.

154
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:24,885
Yes, of course, those who could not come,

155
00:46:24,938 --> 00:46:26,938
because they arrived late, I told them

156
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,469
there is no program in the evening.

157
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,640
All the Spanish,

158
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:34,816
how sweet they were.

159
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:38,425
Those who were here and did not come,

160
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:40,399
otherwise.

161
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:53,657
/?/

162
00:46:54,753 --> 00:46:57,277
/?/

163
00:46:57,618 --> 00:46:58,367
When did you come?

164
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:01,992
/?/

165
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:07,851
/?/

166
00:47:09,547 --> 00:47:10,483
/?/

167
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:14,059
/?/

168
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:29,154
/?/

169
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:37,803
/?/

170
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:44,198
Yes, you can come along Swiss people…

171
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,737
Those who were here and did not come,

172
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:36,713
should understand that you are living

173
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,959
in the Kingdom of God.

174
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:49,698
And when the Goddess of that Kingdom arrives,

175
00:48:50,248 --> 00:48:51,686
you have to be there.

176
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:09,973
I'm sorry I have to do that,

177
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:12,059
this is the promise I had to give to all the Deities.

178
00:49:26,658 --> 00:49:28,658
Know that you have to have all and more,

179
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,250
you have to work hard. You have to meditate.

180
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:36,008
Shows, that there is no discipline.

181
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:48,422
I will also forgive Austrians, because their leader wanted to go.

182
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,882
Austrians should be forgiven,

183
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,531
because their leader wanted to go.

184
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:58,769
They could come up too.

185
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:10,423
One man can save and one man can destroy.

186
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:15,951
Your leader is alright till it comes to Mother's point,

187
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:18,451
but when you reach that point,

188
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,540
then, you have to protest against your leader.

189
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:30,238
Come along, come, sit here.

190
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,710
All the rest should go at the back,

191
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:34,469
just go at the back.

192
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:41,597
Please go back. All others, go back,

193
00:50:43,884 --> 00:50:44,875
and sit down there.

194
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:53,478
I had to promise this. I had to promise this to the Deities.

195
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,710
They would not accept, they would not accept!

196
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,592
You must know there are Deities and Ganas and everyone is sitting here.

197
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:22,955
They came forward before me, to France.

198
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:34,774
24 hours they are working, you know that very well.

199
00:51:34,827 --> 00:51:36,827
You know it, it's not a story. You know that.

200
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:40,874
They are working for you, helping you in every way, solving all your problems,

201
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:41,697
don't they?

202
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:53,282
Gavin also should not do my Puja.

203
00:51:53,286 --> 00:51:54,472
Because he should have said that.

204
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,718
So Gavin should go back.

205
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,413
And all the English, who came here early,

206
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:01,900
just to attend everything, to attend what, the nonsense?

207
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:08,666
Gavin said he did not know, there was going to be a lecture

208
00:52:08,674 --> 00:52:09,966
otherwise he would of object it.

209
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:11,818
But what about coming to the airport_

210
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,327
English know how much I have worked with them.

211
00:52:28,624 --> 00:52:31,260
All the leaders who did not protest should also go back.

212
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:40,391
All should go.

213
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,048
Those who have not protested.

214
00:52:57,331 --> 00:52:58,417
Guido you protested?

215
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:01,487
Yes, Italians could be there.

216
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:09,556
Guido protested,

217
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:13,045
he could not understand: what was happening? Where is our Mother?

218
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:19,086
Come this side. All the rest go at the back.

219
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:25,925
What courage is needed for that kind of a thing?

220
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:34,894
Of course.

221
00:53:41,549 --> 00:53:43,563
Otherwise there is a protest for everything,

222
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:45,808
every day I'm receiving letters from people:

223
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:50,071
"This is not good, that is not working out in Australia,

224
00:53:50,078 --> 00:53:52,229
is not working out here, that is not happening”.

225
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,520
Everybody has a right to criticize everyone.

226
00:54:30,332 --> 00:54:33,695
French have been stupid in the past, and they are stupid even now.

227
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:35,303
That's what they are,

228
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,346
think knowing no end of themselves.

229
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,925
Spanish people were, once upon a time, very aggressive,

230
00:54:41,206 --> 00:54:43,206
but in Sahaja Yoga they are not like that.

231
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,380
You must learn how to respect.

232
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:57,788
You've had no good training.

233
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:01,060
“Very bad breeding” - that's what God is going to say about you.

234
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:07,123
I've done my level best to tell you how to behave.

235
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:27,097
No protocol, any sense of protocol you have.

236
00:55:29,222 --> 00:55:30,225
It's like beggars.

237
00:55:43,031 --> 00:55:45,031
Today you have to resolve,

238
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:50,105
and ask the forgiveness of all the Deities,

239
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:55,894
that you are going to use your vibrations all the time. Resolve.

240
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:02,059
And that no more such a thing we are going to repeat again. This is the last,

241
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:03,845
never like this.

242
00:56:04,674 --> 00:56:06,937
I am very suppressed that English,

243
00:56:06,944 --> 00:56:09,836
they come even in sleet, in snow, this, that.

244
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:12,879
And here what happened, as soon as they came to hell they became hellish?

245
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,329
What have happen to the English?

246
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,215
They have no personality of their own?

247
00:56:25,683 --> 00:56:29,305
Always they followed the French, and now go with them to the ditch.

248
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:32,300
Is that the principle now maintain?

249
00:56:36,762 --> 00:56:39,254
“French Sahaja yogis said, French Sahaja yogis said”.

250
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,818
Tomorrow French Sahaja yogi said: “Go and kill your Mother”. We’ll kill it.

251
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:47,469
Is it?

252
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:51,138
Because French Sahaja yogi have said.

253
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:10,679
No individuality, no understanding of anything, stupid.

254
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,823
/?/

255
00:57:17,337 --> 00:57:18,192
/?/

256
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:36,713
/?/

257
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,489
/?/

258
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,980
/?/

259
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:51,783
/?/

260
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:54,328
/?/

261
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,795
/?/

262
00:58:09,415 --> 00:58:11,415
/?/

263
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:15,702
/?/

264
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:22,070
This Yashi has come to Me from her childhood.

265
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,358
And as children they used to come all the way.

266
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,841
Do you know where this Old Delhi is,

267
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:30,110
and where her father was working for the university.

268
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:35,386
Whether I came at 6 o’clock, or 8 o’clock, or 10 o’clock,

269
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:37,639
or in the night of a 12 o’clock.

270
00:58:37,734 --> 00:58:41,541
Her father with all his three daughters used to be there.

271
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:46,405
And so much bubbling and joy that Mother has come.

272
00:59:10,728 --> 00:59:12,728
/?/

273
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,839
/?/

274
00:59:17,242 --> 00:59:18,307
/?/

275
00:59:19,388 --> 00:59:21,388
/?/

276
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:24,804
/?/

277
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:31,805
/?/

278
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:34,483
/?/

279
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:36,983
/?/

280
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,875
/?/

281
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:56,912
/?/

282
01:00:10,046 --> 01:00:12,279
/?/

283
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:17,995
Many people have not seen me for month together.

284
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,982
Whether you have seen me or not.

285
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,504
As I'm angry with you,

286
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,515
also I'm pleased with some people,

287
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,237
those who have love for me.

288
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:54,049
And as a symbol of that I want to give this ring to Guido.

289
01:01:20,575 --> 01:01:23,323
What surprises me, the gurus who lynch you,

290
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:29,523
the one who wanted this,

291
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:36,592
Rolls Royce. They starved themselves for one year,

292
01:01:37,356 --> 01:01:38,688
bought a Rolls Royce,

293
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:46,721
and went to receive him, and such a crowd

294
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:48,957
that people could not get to the airport.

295
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,774
That sort of a guru you need,

296
01:01:53,032 --> 01:01:55,032
who'll take you to hell!

297
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,325
You don't want to go to heaven.

298
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:06,096
You don't want to be the citizen of God's realm.

299
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:37,998
Now whatever mantra you say,

300
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:41,271
please listen.

301
01:02:42,899 --> 01:02:44,899
Put it in your heads what you are talking.

302
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:51,955
What you are saying from your lips, listen.

303
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,405
Put it in your heart what you are saying.

304
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:00,699
Don't be hypocrites.

305
01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:09,212
No explanation is needed.

306
01:03:09,324 --> 01:03:12,488
"I've been to a guru, I've done this, I've done"- nothing of the kind.

307
01:03:16,248 --> 01:03:18,248
Even if at this stage, after so many days,

308
01:03:19,453 --> 01:03:22,530
if you have not realized that whatever we believe into

309
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:25,204
should be

310
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,730
part and parcel of ourselves.

311
01:03:27,983 --> 01:03:29,983
I mean these wretched people like

312
01:03:30,025 --> 01:03:31,918
Christians and other people, these

313
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,732
Hindus and Muslims and all that,

314
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:36,624
they've not seen God, they've not got realization, nothing

315
01:03:36,824 --> 01:03:39,052
but to them it becomes a faith, they fight for it.

316
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:43,122
And for you people who have seen the reality - it is not,

317
01:03:44,433 --> 01:03:45,578
what's wrong with me?

318
01:03:57,496 --> 01:03:59,834
People are afraid of the police, afraid of this.

319
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:01,893
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

320
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,288
You have seen what has happened

321
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:07,596
with people who have tried to trouble me.

322
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:16,776
Aren't you afraid of that?

323
01:04:28,377 --> 01:04:29,724
Don't become frivolous:

324
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:34,561
"What was there to go to the airport, after all doesn't matter".

325
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:40,958
All the Ganas went there, with me.

326
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,524
They have all noted down, and they are here too.

327
01:04:51,112 --> 01:04:54,210
I am so cautiously taking you out, because you don't see them.

328
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:56,023
But you'll see them very soon.

329
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,586
It's not easy to control them also, you must know that.

330
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,392
I do not control you, neither I control them.

331
01:05:22,143 --> 01:05:26,512
So now, I don't want to be unkind to people

332
01:05:26,907 --> 01:05:30,121
who have been desiring to come and see me, who love me so much.

333
01:05:31,643 --> 01:05:35,235
And I want to forgive you all, all of you,

334
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,140
because this was the first mistake.

335
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:05,592
Nobody should fix my program without asking me.

336
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:08,184
Nobody should take such liberties.

337
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,704
From next time I will not do anything of the kind,

338
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,048
I'm telling you very clearly!

339
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,846
You fix my program, and I'll let you down!

340
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,521
Without asking me you are not to fix me anywhere.

341
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:26,674
Without taking my permission, written permission.

342
01:06:28,762 --> 01:06:32,088
If you ever try to do such tricks with me, I'll put you right.

343
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:41,644
You know I have all the powers to correct you.

344
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:47,683
Don't take liberties with me anymore.

345
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:49,402
I'm telling you, I am warning you.

346
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:54,945
Try to understand, you are facing

347
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:58,570
Someone, Who has all the Powers.

348
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,033
You know that,

349
01:07:08,534 --> 01:07:11,255
know well, within yourself.

350
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:19,602
It's not even like Mohammad. Mohammad just talked.

351
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,580
He never gave realization,

352
01:07:25,127 --> 01:07:25,873
He warned.

353
01:07:27,614 --> 01:07:28,976
None of them, none of them.

354
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:34,997
But after seeing, none of them have photographs as you have seen of mine.

355
01:07:35,076 --> 01:07:35,642
Have they?

356
01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:47,378
What more proof you want to know what I am.

357
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:51,249
Now behave yourself. I'm warning you!

358
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:54,114
Mahamaya -

359
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:59,278
the other side of it is horrible.

360
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:01,494
Be careful.

361
01:08:09,067 --> 01:08:10,163
Only for those

362
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:13,878
who are my children I come on this earth.

363
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:16,261
Not for those who are not,

364
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:19,600
I've nothing to do with them.

365
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:28,716
I did try

366
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:31,481
to save you, as a prodigal son has to be saved,

367
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:33,576
that's different. That's very different.

368
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,778
But don't take liberties with me, I must tell you and warn you.

369
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,414
I do not need any. The heat is just

370
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,656
drying up everything.

371
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:32,655
I feel like a Mother who is insulted, abused,

372
01:09:33,404 --> 01:09:35,404
ill-treated by her own children.

373
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:42,676
You can take insults from others,

374
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:44,384
not from your own children. You cannot.

375
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:46,403
Very difficult.

376
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:56,612
If you do not understand any protocol,

377
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,190
because you are so naive,

378
01:09:58,575 --> 01:10:01,266
you have never known anything, you don't know how to respect.

379
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:06,757
Then you better learn it.

380
01:10:15,426 --> 01:10:16,350
There is no Shraddha,

381
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:20,605
because it was never there. You don't know how to respect anyone.

382
01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:24,702
You only have respect for yourself, perhaps may not be that even.

383
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:42,075
Today is a day of a very great event.

384
01:10:45,694 --> 01:10:46,371
And

385
01:10:49,856 --> 01:10:54,481
“Guru" is a word as I told you, comes from the word "Gravity".

386
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,433
The gravity. And the gravity,

387
01:11:01,572 --> 01:11:04,676
that's what I felt, that I have no gravity to attract you people.

388
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,073
Or you people have no weight at all in you, that I should gravitate you.

389
01:11:18,698 --> 01:11:20,698
Anything that has weight

390
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:26,982
gravitates, automatically.

391
01:11:29,725 --> 01:11:33,411
It does not gravitate towards itself, but it gravitates.

392
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:39,855
There's also gravity between the matter.

393
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:47,811
But what it has towards Mother Earth is incomparable.

394
01:11:49,767 --> 01:11:51,767
You throw any stone out, it comes back.

395
01:11:58,312 --> 01:12:00,312
Impossible to fight the gravity.

396
01:12:05,402 --> 01:12:09,806
And that gravity is the integration

397
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:12,573
of your Shraddha,

398
01:12:13,905 --> 01:12:16,025
of your Dedication, and your surrender.

399
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,790
Without that gravity you cannot nourish yourself, you cannot grow.

400
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:37,449
Just imagine, the roots

401
01:12:39,553 --> 01:12:41,553
go towards the gravity.

402
01:12:43,345 --> 01:12:46,435
And when they are nourished, then only, the tree rises above.

403
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:52,248
If your roots are not deep, if your roots are so flimsy,

404
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:54,329
you cannot go down.

405
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:01,098
Unless you go down in that gravity,

406
01:13:02,683 --> 01:13:03,532
you cannot come up.

407
01:13:05,324 --> 01:13:06,478
You cannot nourish yourself.

408
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,003
Now my talk should not be a waste again.

409
01:13:09,503 --> 01:13:10,417
Please listen to me.

410
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:14,473
I'm addressing to you, all of you. Remember that.

411
01:13:16,343 --> 01:13:19,566
Do not think that I'm addressing to somebody else. It is to you all.

412
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,387
So the only way one can ascend in Sahaja Yoga is through

413
01:13:25,887 --> 01:13:26,757
putting the roots down.

414
01:13:27,648 --> 01:13:29,202
Allow the roots to grow.

415
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:33,316
Unless and until roots grow, the tree cannot grow.

416
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:36,349
I have seen many Sahaja yogis who talk big about Sahaja Yoga,

417
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:38,822
they can write books, they can write things.

418
01:13:39,008 --> 01:13:42,210
The other day I saw somebody writing a big pamphlet about Sahaja Yoga,

419
01:13:43,254 --> 01:13:44,553
nothing inside the person!

420
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:51,551
That's not the sign of a Sahaja yogi.

421
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:54,442
A Sahaja yogi has to gravitate inside.

422
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,247
How do we do it?

423
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:05,340
In the year 1982 I told you the eightfold ways of doing it,

424
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:06,850
and I said: I will tell you later.

425
01:14:08,134 --> 01:14:10,134
And I was about to tell you. But not now,

426
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,315
there are other eight ways by which you can rise.

427
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:22,238
Because, you are not yet grounded in Sahaja Yoga, you are not yet grounded.

428
01:14:28,243 --> 01:14:31,364
I thought you would be grounded, you're not.

429
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:35,815
You have to nourish

430
01:14:37,937 --> 01:14:42,348
the other way around. The roots are in the head,

431
01:14:46,494 --> 01:14:52,591
by becoming thoughtless, by not making the cells to think.

432
01:14:55,990 --> 01:15:00,118
By resting them, by peace within. It is not a show of a peace,

433
01:15:00,764 --> 01:15:05,066
or just some people look very peaceful for a show.

434
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,876
You have to work it out here in your head.

435
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:11,871
The grounding - it has to go into your awareness.

436
01:15:15,361 --> 01:15:17,361
How? - Meditation.

437
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:21,830
There's no discipline I'm told.

438
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:25,608
Hounslow, I'm told, there's no discipline of any kind.

439
01:15:26,254 --> 01:15:28,456
I'm surprised Hounslow people have no discipline

440
01:15:28,628 --> 01:15:30,757
of getting up early in the morning and doing meditation.

441
01:15:36,872 --> 01:15:37,586
What are you doing?

442
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,088
How are you going to grow?

443
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,163
How does the tree grow? It does not grow in the day time.

444
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:52,384
It grows in the morning, early in the morning, you never see that.

445
01:15:59,027 --> 01:16:01,399
How these roots are going to grow into the head?

446
01:16:02,264 --> 01:16:07,008
Into your brain, into that Jada (gross).

447
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:14,611
You have to meditate. That's the only way you can do it.

448
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:18,171
Those who do not meditate will become superficial.

449
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,842
They'll not achieve anything, they create problems /?/.

450
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:25,598
If they are right sided, they'll become supra-conscious, they'll become bhoots.

451
01:16:26,864 --> 01:16:29,575
If they are left-sided, they'll become left sided they will be thrown out!

452
01:16:29,616 --> 01:16:31,456
You've seen it, in the Sistine Chapel,

453
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,874
you see Christ throwing them out one by one.

454
01:16:34,927 --> 01:16:38,375
And then you should not blame me. Just listening to me is not sufficient.

455
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,962
It must grow. Actualization of the growth of the thing is needed.

456
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:44,855
Do you follow that?

457
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:53,070
You've read all kinds of nonsensical things before.

458
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,799
All kinds of horrid things, I know what you have read.

459
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:01,503
You have read in this horrible French country all kinds of

460
01:17:02,844 --> 01:17:04,151
sadists, like Sade,

461
01:17:07,596 --> 01:17:09,245
or Sade whatever you call him.

462
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:13,394
And there were many like this,

463
01:17:14,606 --> 01:17:16,075
who wrote horrible books for you,

464
01:17:16,575 --> 01:17:18,575
which you have read. But they have not read "Advent".

465
01:17:19,075 --> 01:17:21,075
How many Sahaja yogis who have not yet read "Advent"?

466
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,940
But only reading is not going to help, it must go into your brain.

467
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:29,796
And brain means what? Into your Central Nervous System.

468
01:17:30,505 --> 01:17:32,505
Brain doesn't mean in the thinking.

469
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:35,523
Into your central nervous system, into

470
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,181
the cells of your central nervous system.

471
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:43,662
That light has to come into the cells.

472
01:17:46,925 --> 01:17:48,925
You have to grow and grow, and grow!

473
01:17:54,323 --> 01:17:56,815
There's only way left out for you to go to Himalayas,

474
01:17:58,459 --> 01:18:00,459
and not to any Ashram or any place.

475
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:03,656
But settle down somewhere where you don't eat anything

476
01:18:03,723 --> 01:18:06,816
or do anything, and take another birth. That's the only way I think.

477
01:18:13,972 --> 01:18:16,250
We can work it out, not difficult.

478
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,778
If you have the seeking within your heart,

479
01:18:23,785 --> 01:18:25,174
and if you have understanding,

480
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:27,199
sense, intelligence to understand that

481
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:30,020
you have achieved something in life, you can do it.

482
01:18:33,436 --> 01:18:34,489
You all can do it.

483
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:41,588
We don't forgive others, we forgive ourselves.

484
01:18:41,614 --> 01:18:43,105
This is the worst thing that we do.

485
01:18:45,056 --> 01:18:47,056
We all the time try to forgive others,

486
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:49,858
that's the best way

487
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:54,930
to work it out. But no, we try

488
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:59,242
to forgive ourselves all the time and not to forgive others.

489
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:02,789
Everything you do the other way around.

490
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:08,854
We are Sahaja yogis. We're yogis, Saints.

491
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:15,259
So, you have to be the guru.

492
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,504
I'm a Guru myself,

493
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:22,702
and what's the conveyance of a Guru?

494
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:26,221
What is the animal he keeps? His dog.

495
01:19:29,051 --> 01:19:32,155
And do you know what a dog is? Do you know the qualities of a dog?

496
01:19:34,114 --> 01:19:35,942
He loves his master.

497
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:39,124
He'll give his life for his Master.

498
01:19:41,536 --> 01:19:44,687
He'll not sleep till he sees his master return back.

499
01:19:50,308 --> 01:19:51,086
Any time!

500
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,000
We had a dog,

501
01:19:55,309 --> 01:19:58,520
and every time I went out, every time

502
01:19:58,587 --> 01:20:01,713
he would come and sit at the door waiting for me.

503
01:20:08,897 --> 01:20:13,161
And some people tried very hard thing on him, some vegetarians

504
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,013
and he was about to die. We put him in the hospital.

505
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,662
When I went there, I sat before him.

506
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:24,631
He just pulled all his body,

507
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:29,346
put his head on my feet, and died peacefully.

508
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:33,195
It's a dog, animal.

509
01:20:42,068 --> 01:20:44,388
When I went away, say, out of

510
01:20:45,586 --> 01:20:47,586
my house, he would not eat food till I came back.

511
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:50,490
To any other country I went, he would not eat food

512
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,530
for all these days. He would not eat his food,

513
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:53,579
till I came back.

514
01:20:56,896 --> 01:20:59,825
He would not disturb me, but would sleep outside

515
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:01,868
waiting for me to get up.

516
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,417
That's a disciple. Unless and until you become good disciples

517
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:13,899
how are you going to become the gurus?

518
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,328
What's the use of my telling you anything about it?

519
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,229
You don't have any discipline of your own,

520
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:22,077
how are you going to give discipline to others?

521
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:26,620
You yourself are tempted into all kinds of things,

522
01:21:27,305 --> 01:21:29,844
how are you going to make others

523
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:32,110
understand you? What have you got, to become the guru?

524
01:21:33,303 --> 01:21:37,513
What can you give? All the Saints have spent their own money,

525
01:21:38,013 --> 01:21:40,266
all over the world any where it is.

526
01:21:42,551 --> 01:21:44,892
To spread Sahaja Yoga how much money have you spent?

527
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:51,661
Of your own. How much money have you spent of your own to spread Sahaja Yoga?

528
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,543
They used to starve themselves

529
01:21:59,825 --> 01:22:02,911
to get some. I have spent thousands, you know that very well.

530
01:22:03,105 --> 01:22:06,424
You know for definite how many thousands I have spent on you people.

531
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:11,225
Even the Puja money that I get, you know, each and every money,

532
01:22:11,334 --> 01:22:14,285
I use it for buying some silver things for you.

533
01:22:15,371 --> 01:22:19,427
It should not be for you, it is for me I should say, but I do it.

534
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:29,056
Every Saint used to spend money,

535
01:22:29,556 --> 01:22:32,939
Christ had to spend money to spread His Christianity,

536
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:36,302
He never spread Christianity, His own message.

537
01:22:38,265 --> 01:22:39,519
Tukarama had to do it,

538
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:42,491
Gyaneshwara had to do it. Whatever they had,

539
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,769
they used that money, whatever they had, to spread

540
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:51,254
Sahaja Yoga. Why? In Sahaja Yoga,

541
01:22:52,446 --> 01:22:55,093
the greatest thing I notice, everybody is so blessed.

542
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,389
They have nice houses, nice ashrams,

543
01:22:59,527 --> 01:23:01,782
all conveniences, everything so well done.

544
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:04,773
They are so blessed.

545
01:23:06,888 --> 01:23:10,225
God looks after them, all their problems get solved. They want

546
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,375
marriages, so good marriages are done, everything is done well.

547
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,490
Everything gets sorted out.

548
01:23:18,463 --> 01:23:20,308
Only blessings are there, no duties.

549
01:23:27,895 --> 01:23:29,731
How much money have you spent for Sahaja Yoga?

550
01:23:29,935 --> 01:23:31,784
First of all you should ask a question.

551
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,110
How much time I have given for Sahaja Yoga?

552
01:23:35,005 --> 01:23:37,005
How many people I have given realization to?

553
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,561
How much righteous and virtuous I have been?

554
01:23:44,337 --> 01:23:46,783
What have I done to bring the good name to Sahaja Yoga?

555
01:23:47,665 --> 01:23:49,919
What about my personal behavior, how I have lived?

556
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:00,669
Arneau has spent lot of money I know,

557
01:24:02,499 --> 01:24:06,483
he and his wife. I know about everyone.

558
01:24:15,127 --> 01:24:17,127
You have to give time, money,

559
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:20,288
everything, your job,

560
01:24:20,637 --> 01:24:23,215
everything you have to give up. People have given up jobs!

561
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:25,715
I've told you the stories

562
01:24:26,552 --> 01:24:29,565
how people have sacrificed for ordinary things like

563
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,065
freedom, fighting and all that.

564
01:24:36,745 --> 01:24:39,144
So today, as I told you, you have to resolve

565
01:24:39,644 --> 01:24:41,644
that we are going to have

566
01:24:42,939 --> 01:24:45,761
the growth within ourselves through our Shraddha

567
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:47,073
and through our surrender.

568
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,130
Only through Meditation you can do it.

569
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:56,746
“We are all going to grow Mother into this”,

570
01:24:57,151 --> 01:25:00,660
this you have to promise me as I stand before you as a Guru.

571
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:02,812
Alright?

572
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:14,406
We'll have the Guru Puja now, not Mother's Puja I don't feel like having.

573
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:16,761
Let’s start the Guru Puja. Come along.

574
01:25:17,783 --> 01:25:21,930
Bring the water, I have to wash My hands for the Guru Puja

575
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:37,976
When I say something, you will smile and talk to me, giggle, laugh,

576
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:39,268
in the program also.

577
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:41,523
In the church you keep quiet.

578
01:25:42,244 --> 01:25:44,731
If there is a bhoot-of-a-pope sitting, you all keep quiet.

579
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:55,604
No breeding at all, ill-mannered, badly brought up.

580
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:08,608
It's better you give me only porcelain one.

581
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,900
/?/

582
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,125
It's like a dog becomes mad, you know.

583
01:26:18,497 --> 01:26:20,946
But such dogs are killed.

584
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:23,802
They are not kept in the public.

585
01:26:29,286 --> 01:26:30,367
/?/

586
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:32,867
Such sweet dogs. See one by one.

587
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:37,094
See now Italians have brought such beautiful dogs for you to see.

588
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
/?/

589
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:08,816
(Sahaja Yogi: Those are the dogs chosen by Shri Mataji herself).

590
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:10,896
I chose you also.

591
01:27:11,863 --> 01:27:15,144
I've chosen you also. But look at them how sweet they are.

592
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:20,588
So pleasure giving, so joy giving.

593
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:25,892
They are so timely they'll absorb

594
01:27:26,633 --> 01:27:29,688
all the anger of the Deities I'm sure,

595
01:27:29,779 --> 01:27:31,231
sitting down here like Deities.

596
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:32,951
Beautifully.

597
01:28:20,605 --> 01:28:24,269
/?/ that is the one to keep it here, has to bark at people,

598
01:28:26,949 --> 01:28:29,558
for those who do not behave. Turn it out like that.

599
01:28:31,976 --> 01:28:32,952
German dog.

600
01:28:52,693 --> 01:28:54,693
So sweet they are. Beautiful.

601
01:29:05,871 --> 01:29:09,222
Do not forgive yourself, forgive others.

602
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:14,546
Then you will become gurus.

603
01:29:17,213 --> 01:29:18,426
Life should be such,

604
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:22,773
that those who come in close contact with you should feel respect for you,

605
01:29:25,007 --> 01:29:28,525
that you are so disciplined. You are very disciplined.

606
01:29:34,752 --> 01:29:37,754
I've seen this. My husband is coming,

607
01:29:39,204 --> 01:29:41,743
tomorrow, you'll be having program.

608
01:29:43,113 --> 01:29:45,574
And I've seen one thing about his life,

609
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:49,692
one thing, which I have to tell you,

610
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:54,116
which has made him such a great man. He's an extremely disciplined man.

611
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:56,123
Extremely disciplined.

612
01:30:02,283 --> 01:30:03,821
The one, who does not have discipline,

613
01:30:03,834 --> 01:30:05,834
is like a dog which is amuck,

614
01:30:08,497 --> 01:30:10,983
which has got rabies.

615
01:30:14,267 --> 01:30:16,930
After realization you have to be disciplined people.

616
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:24,692
Discipline yourself. This is what I said in 1982, again I'm repeating it.

617
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:30,657
But now, the second half of it which I said, I'll tell in India,

618
01:30:32,147 --> 01:30:34,492
which I hope they will send it over to you.
