1
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,278
There are so many of you who have got realization very recently.

2
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:22,882
Some people are such who have got their realization a few days back

3
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,576
and there are some who have got their realization long back

4
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:29,207
those who have understood

5
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:34,117
what is one's own consciousness and how does it work?

6
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:36,050
How does it work?

7
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,375
And how do we go on adopting it.

8
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:44,197
Because of being three types of people here

9
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:46,646
I will have to repeat some of the points and tell you

10
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:51,577
so that you will be able to understand, what does realzation mean

11
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:54,792
What are the qualities of a realized person?

12
00:00:54,817 --> 00:00:56,927
Last time also I have told you a lot about

13
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:59,066
what are the qualities of a realized person?

14
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:06,100
And next, how should we be in our realized state

15
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,044
In this way I will tell you about these three categories.

16
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,324
This at least should be done

17
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,047
that whatever you have studied currently

18
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:19,834
 whatever you have read here as well, forget that this moment.

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,621
First of all, the question is what is the meaning of realization?

20
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:36,061
When you come to My feet

21
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:43,910
many people are told that they haven't got their realization

22
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:47,853
and many are told that they have got their realization.

23
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:54,358
It means first of all that realization has no connection with

24
00:01:54,398 --> 00:02:01,633
your outward body, mind or intellect but with some inner being

25
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:05,618
which in some people gets connected, whereas in others doesn't.

26
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:14,599
During your realization, when you are at My feet, at that time

27
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:17,198
those who feel on the hands

28
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:21,735
they feel the flow coming with a greater force on their hands.

29
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:28,579
And you also feel something going into your feet.

30
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:35,832
All around yourself, man's environment's

31
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:39,885
and all around the whole world

32
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,016
the CHAITANYA SHAKTI ( power of consciousness)

33
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,686
 is playing, inside and outside.

34
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,284
For example, every tree has power of consciousness inside it.

35
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,396
Its leaves also have the power of consciousness.

36
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,574
Its root also has.

37
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,967
In the same way

38
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:59,384
the power of consciousness resides even in the whole universe.

39
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,967
Just as Ether is present all around

40
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:05,441
in the same way, this CHAITANYA SHAKTI is moving all around

41
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:09,235
and inside, outside, everywhere is its abode.

42
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:14,513
And the same shakti (CHAITANYA)

43
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:19,820
goes on doing whatever complete work of JAD SHAKTI is to be done.

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,542
Now this power within us is known as kundalini.

45
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,649
But Kundalini is a word

46
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:34,507
although, God has not

47
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:38,378
given any meaning of anything, nor has He given any word

48
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,680
For example, (God) has not named  anything

49
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:43,561
but human beings have named it Kundalini.

50
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:55,202
The power called Kundalini inside our being

51
00:03:55,227 --> 00:04:00,072
is situated at the base of our spine in the triangular bone.

52
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:05,410
I am about to release an article about that in Manohar Shakti.

53
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:08,065
You better read all the details of that

54
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,256
and you will come to know the scietific names of that too.

55
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,291
Many of you know that

56
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:18,886
your attention

57
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:35,692
your attention when you are an ordinary human being

58
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,482
is on your body, intellect and mind, all the three.

59
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:46,406
You go on seeking that thing which gives you joy.

60
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:54,882
When you are at one with that CHAITANYA SHAKTI

61
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,876
because of kundalini awakening

62
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,347
at Sahastrara, your attention gets one with that

63
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:13,416
then your attention goes to your Kundalini.

64
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:16,228
And the moment it goes to your own kundalini

65
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:20,317
your attention goes to other's kundalini as well.

66
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,199
That means, till now your attention could go to three places

67
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:28,818
and now it goes to fourth place

68
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:31,126
which is NIRAKAR SHAKTI ( formless power).

69
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:35,872
And the moment you go into that state, you go beyond your thoughts

70
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:39,992
and watch you mind, intellect and body in the witness state.

71
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:49,901
Now those from whose hands the cool breeze is flowing

72
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:59,214
these vibrations we have got so effortlessly

73
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,535
that we don't know what a great thing we have got!

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,684
The first biggest problem is

75
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,898
'How did we get such a great thing so easily?'

76
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,924
For example, just understand like this

77
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,213
that a human birth we get so easily

78
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:24,026
that we don't know that to get a human birth

79
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,067
after struggling for so many births

80
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,034
with great difficulty we get human birth

81
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,726
and its rebirth

82
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:36,344
after a great struggle for all the births we had

83
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:38,703
and after a lot of seeking, one can get rebirth.

84
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:41,925
But this is happening so easily

85
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,490
that we are not able to understand its value.

86
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:50,048
We also think that how did it happen so quickly.

87
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:56,633
The reason was that until now you were seeking everything outside

88
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:59,021
and it is within you.

89
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,730
For example, there is a diamond within you

90
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,064
and you are searching for it all over the world

91
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,948
and it was found lying within you only.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,647
Then someone tells you that the diamond is here only

93
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,151
and tells you even the route.

94
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,296
You pick up the diamond.

95
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,642
Will you say,"How did i get it in no time?"

96
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,758
You will only say

97
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:19,057
"I was here only and why i was searching for it all over the world?"

98
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,403
This is actually happening.

99
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:26,699
When we get such a state on account of Sahaj Yoga

100
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:33,790
actually we get it so easily

101
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:36,396
that we cannot understand how did we achieve this state?

102
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:45,543
Or say, that in the modern age, as you suddenly reach Moon

103
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:47,865
You may not even know

104
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,683
if you could reach Moon in a moment.

105
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,859
If such an arrangement could be made

106
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:58,307
it is quite possible that you will feel

107
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:03,498
where did we reach?

108
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:04,731
How is it possible?

109
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:08,111
How did we reach Moon in a moment?

110
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:12,016
In the same way this incident

111
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:15,917
takes place so easily

112
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:19,014
this incident takes place so easily

113
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,172
that it is quite natural for you to feel so.

114
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:26,146
But, if something happens easily

115
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:29,506
or with a great difficulty

116
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:32,784
you remember one which takes place with a great difficulty.

117
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,841
And one can understand that, which happens with difficulty.

118
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,997
It is man's nature.

119
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:41,134
And a man considers himself blessed in that

120
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,007
which he gets by doing his duty.

121
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:47,035
Even if his father gives him one lakh rupees

122
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,195
he doesn't understand its importance.

123
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,556
If he earns even two rupees by dint of his hard work

124
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:53,582
he has great importance for it

125
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,238
as he feels it is because of his own effort.

126
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,554
It is an indication of his own ego.

127
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,025
It is the nature of his Ego.

128
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,488
But in Sahaj Yoga when there is no Ego

129
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:06,512
there is no question of getting anything because of Ego.

130
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:09,927
So ego being dissatisfied

131
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,433
raises such doubts within

132
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,155
that why it is so in Sahaj?

133
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:20,314
Methods of your own realization

134
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,511
and all that happens

135
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,473
 (NOT CLEAR)

136
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:25,914
many of you have felt it.

137
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:29,775
you will find a new method in each book

138
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,718
that when self realization takes place

139
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,184
it happens like this, like that.

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,697
Now how many of them are realized and how many are not, God knows.

141
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,029
Out of you, those who have got realization

142
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:43,922
 and have acquired your ascent slowly

143
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,754
you know that when a person gets realization

144
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,750
only his Sahatrara breaks

145
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:52,506
and he gets one with the vibrartions.

146
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:58,770
After that he remains still here only

147
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:02,654
and his attention goes to his own and other's kundalini

148
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,850
but the vibrations that are coming inside his own self

149
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,402
sometimes stop suddenly.

150
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:10,151
And if he puts his hand on his head, he will find

151
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:14,538
that the spot which had become soft, has become hard again

152
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:15,578
gets calcified.

153
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:20,934
(NOT CLEAR)

154
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,315
You have got realization just yesterday and it has calcified.

155
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,345
What is the reason?

156
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,583
The reason is that

157
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:34,421
our ego and superego inside us are definitely removed

158
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:37,025
our attention comes in the center definitely

159
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,789
but it grows again and and become one.

160
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,909
 It grows again becomes one

161
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:54,657
and when it grows and becomes one

162
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:58,277
the calcification takes place again and the flow stops

163
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:00,793
but even then you can feel kundalini.

164
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:02,743
But how?

165
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:06,212
If after that you meditate and put your hands towards ME

166
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:11,253
you will feel that this hand or thumb has caught up.

167
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:12,802
They have got realization

168
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:15,391
because those who are not realized

169
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,421
those who are not realized, if they put their hands towards ME

170
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,745
they won't feel anything.

171
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,628
But those who have got their realization

172
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:27,245
they will say ,"Mataji my this finger has caught up."

173
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,889
They will feel that this finger of mine has caught up.

174
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:35,329
or this finger of mine has caught up

175
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:36,078
i am not getting in this

176
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:36,894
i am getting in this (Pointing to particular fingers).

177
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,724
Out of those who will be knowledgeable, they will understand

178
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,217
which finger points to which chakra

179
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,737
It is not an imaginary situation.

180
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:49,188
This cannot be known through mental calculations.

181
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,415
I didn't tell you.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,946
Because had I told you so

183
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,078
people would have said, " Mataji is just talking uselessly."

184
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:56,345
I said,"you find out."

185
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,322
And when he put his hands like this

186
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:00,534
and his this finger started burning

187
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:03,339
I said, (To some sahaj yogi) put your hand on his Nabhi Chakra

188
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:04,957
Nabhi Chakra was working.

189
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,767
Close your eyes and feel within

190
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,461
which chakra of yours is working?

191
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:09,590
Nabhi Chakra is working

192
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:11,312
and when you put your hand towards him

193
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:12,848
which finger is burning, this finger is burning.

194
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:15,988
It means that this finger corresponds to his Nabhi Chakra

195
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:23,155
and everybody's this finger will catch.

196
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,138
So without any discussion the point is that

197
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,019
you may write a book or whatever you like to write

198
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:31,464
the way a thing happens, it happens like that only.

199
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,285
Yesterday, regarding Gyaneshwar ji

200
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,790
a gentleman was arguing too much with me.

201
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,110
Had Gyaneshwar ji been alive today

202
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,453
I would have talked to Him Myself.

203
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,469
He was also searching the method

204
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,548
how to make this to understand

205
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:47,980
but it was not possible as he died at a very young age.

206
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,152
Like this, because of many such untimely deaths

207
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:53,195
a lot of misconceptions have spread in the world.

208
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,005
And he wrote a book, this was his another mistake.

209
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,024
Because of that, I am scared of writing a book

210
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,611
as just on writing a book, people will start learning it by heart

211
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,419
and that too may condition people.

212
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,963
And in this what happens and what does not happen

213
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:11,769
exactly you must think

214
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:15,535
that every minute i have a new experience, it is a new thing.

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,932
We are new people, everything is new.

216
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:20,860
We have to know everything new, we will settle down as new (people).

217
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,637
Like a small child from his childhood

218
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:25,044
listens a single word and goes on learning it

219
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,572
checks repeatedly and understands it.

220
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,449
In the same way those who are new

221
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:34,465
those who have come in this kingdom of God

222
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,509
should understand the divinity of this kingdom.

223
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,886
His vision should be different.

224
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,485
It has a great speciality that it has been named DIVYALOK.

225
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,195
I would pass by here and would feel joyous to read its name

226
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,420
Some great thoughtful person has named it.

227
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:50,003
 How beautiful the name is DIVYALOK?

228
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:54,542
I didn't know that God will make all the arrangements here itself.

229
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,111
Wish the other kindness be bestowed on us.

230
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:01,410
It is a very beautiful place.

231
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,089
The divine kingdom in which you have descended

232
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:08,096
to know its divinity, you should think

233
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:10,422
that all this is new.

234
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:11,737
It is all original.

235
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:13,814
There is all new experience.

236
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,075
Somewhere written, old, shattered

237
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,627
what others have experienced, it is not that.

238
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,912
It is what we have to experience.

239
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:31,125
So, absolutely new, like a new child

240
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,690
in the same way, you come to a new form.

241
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,866
The first thing important is that

242
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:41,063
you pay attention to the newest concepts, all new.

243
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:45,238
Till date nobody has experienced such a thing anywhere.

244
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:49,496
This experiment was never successful so speedily, in this world.

245
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,214
Because I too have come to this world many times

246
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,337
and I tried to do this work many times.

247
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:59,127
This work was successful for the first time in this birth (of Mine).

248
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:05,369
So, the little incompleteness that has remained in everybody

249
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:06,968
you have to complete that.

250
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,869
You have come to complete that incompleteness.

251
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:13,357
You have not come to overpower or reduce anyone

252
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:20,829
You have come to complete whatever incompleteness has been left out.

253
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:22,838
Now you think that

254
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:32,454
you are new people of a new world and new dimension

255
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:37,017
and you have to give guidance for the whole world.

256
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:43,501
So, many realized people sitting under one roof

257
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,946
are being blessed by that Divine Power

258
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:54,200
How much powerful energy flows specially from.

259
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:57,616
It is not so from other people of the world.

260
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:01,898
You are aware of it. There is no doubt about it now.

261
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,328
 Some people have a little bit doubt.

262
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:03,940
Its reason is that

263
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,009
they have got their realization a few days back only.

264
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:12,042
Within a few days they too will feel it.

265
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:16,342
Then it becomes necessary

266
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:22,171
that you understand your importance.

267
00:16:22,196 --> 00:16:27,267
Your greatest quality is that now you are in fourth dimension.

268
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,266
which fourth dimension have you got?

269
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,100
which fourth dimension have you got?

270
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,756
The Chaitanya Shakti that is flowing in you

271
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:40,806
you are standing in that.

272
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,524
Now how can you go from this to that?

273
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:48,207
it is a great important point, you try to understand it.

274
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:54,400
Now how you can get off into it, manage to be in that state

275
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:57,965
is an important point.

276
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,683
Now if you observe your attention

277
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,893
you will observe that there occurs a type of expansion

278
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:05,723
it also stretches within itself.

279
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,318
Feel your attention

280
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:09,414
introspect your attention

281
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,665
It seems as if it goes somewhere else

282
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,885
and if you want you can get it back.

283
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:19,492
Its expansion is going on and if you want you can get it back also.

284
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:27,189
It is like a baloon which is called in Marathi 'phuga'.

285
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,909
You blow it and it will go like this and then come back.

286
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,131
In the same way you watch your attention

287
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:40,452
your attention can go towards anything as well as return back

288
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:44,175
NOT CLEAR

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,710
See our attention has gone towards some object.

290
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:52,258
For example, your attention is on some saree.

291
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:57,777
Your attention has gone towards saree but you can pull it back.

292
00:17:57,802 --> 00:18:03,337
As per your desire, you can minimize or maximize your attention

293
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:05,902
and you can take it wherever you want.

294
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:08,543
But you are fully involved in the center.

295
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:09,793
For example, take the case of sea.

296
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:13,944
the water from the sea overflows all its banks and returns back.

297
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,988
but in the center, everything of the sea

298
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,968
 has its own abode (VASTAVYA)

299
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:23,464
all that is VASTAVYA

300
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,647
that which is going to happen, is inside.

301
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:29,464
Its reaction is awareness.

302
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:32,518
It goes to something and returns back.

303
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:36,007
You learn detachment from this.

304
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,217
From this only we tell you to get detatched.

305
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,873
For example that car came here.

306
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:45,190
It is a minor issue. it is giving out some smell

307
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,777
First of all, it gave out foul smell, o.k!

308
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:51,059
If you pay attention to the foul smell, we will feel it.

309
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,373
You divert your attention, you will not feel foul smell.

310
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,959
You are getting the power of detachment within you.

311
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:02,249
By and by you practice over your attention

312
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:09,975
Man endowed with all religious knowledge is sitting in the center.

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,825
He is paying attention to everything.

314
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,471
What is this, what is this, what is this?

315
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:17,348
This is also,This is also, people say all this is mine.

316
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,146
Pay your attention to that

317
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,697
and the moment you pay attention to that

318
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,324
you know very well that I can take it back as well from there.

319
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,094
Your attention cannot get involved in any such thing

320
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:36,065
and whatever love you will attatch to it or do anything

321
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,086
that will only hit it with a stone and come back

322
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,877
but will not get attatched to it.

323
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:44,379
Try to understand it.

324
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:47,097
Eirlier when you would pay your attention to a thing

325
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,302
with the help of your thoughts.

326
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,742
For example, if anything moves from here

327
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:54,165
that will go on moving as a whole and its range will be maintained.

328
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,896
NOT CLEAR

329
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:57,868
Now the one that will get released from here

330
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:00,076
will take a round turn and then will come towards you.

331
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,445
There is nothing in the center.

332
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:01,935
It is all vacant.

333
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,901
Nowhere it will put a hurdle.

334
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:11,147
In this way attatchment attracts everything.

335
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:13,945
One gets rid of  body, mind and intellect definitely

336
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,874
but of other misidentifications within us too.

337
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:19,950
We are human beings first

338
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:25,067
and finally this truth, and this truth also detaches from us

339
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:29,826
because we do not give up our attatchment

340
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,597
and the method to give up attatchment during meditation is

341
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:36,304
that you increase your attention and enjoy it.

342
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:37,106
Now it has increased.

343
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:39,996
Go there and you get it back.

344
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:44,543
This special power you got after your realization

345
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:47,695
 I have already told you a lot of things

346
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,912
Apart from this, keep in mind that

347
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:55,574
in deeper meditation you have to do

348
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,747
expansion and stretching of your attention.

349
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:03,015
When you will be stretching and expanding your attention

350
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,706
you will be surprised that your depth has increased.

351
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:12,159
Just imagine that if you spread a lot of wheat here

352
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:16,111
the person who has spread a lot of wheat, his stretch will be more

353
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:19,252
then when you collected wheat and piled up

354
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,491
has its height increased or not?

355
00:21:21,516 --> 00:21:26,748
In the same way when you have wrapped up your attention

356
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,115
your inner depth will increase

357
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,514
and what knowledge you got

358
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:33,020
it excited my laughter to know

359
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,511
was i wrapped in this?

360
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,861
Was it worth getting wrapped up into?

361
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:40,581
Means it will appear that it was not so important.

362
00:21:40,606 --> 00:21:43,767
These are not at all very important issues of the world.

363
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,041
In our country there is a boy who had got realization.

364
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,783
He went for an interview.

365
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,840
When he returned back

366
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,124
I asked him have you got through the interview or not?

367
00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:53,449
He said," I don't feel anything, if i have got through or not.

368
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,188
In case i get through, it is good, if not, no problem."

369
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,430
Finally he was selected.

370
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,288
Board people told ME

371
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:03,806
He was a special boy. He came and was not afraid at all.

372
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:08,712
He gave straight forward answers and left, he was not afraid at all.

373
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,397
How is he so?

374
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,754
I said,"I had told you that he is realized.

375
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,201
You examine him specially to find out, what is so special about him?"

376
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,393
He said,  "We observed that

377
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,163
he came, he answered straight forwardly the questions he was put to."

378
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:24,163
He didn't have any trickery, nor anything.

379
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:27,074
He was very straight forward, talked straight forwardly

380
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,999
and then he kept standing

381
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:32,707
and said, if he gets through, well and good, otherwise no problem.

382
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:35,610
Neither he disrespected us in any way

383
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:39,923
nor he wagged his tail behind us.

384
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:43,395
Attention is also like that.

385
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,879
When there is deformation in attention

386
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:49,455
man gets divinity when he gets realized.

387
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,669
When his attention is messy everywhere

388
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:54,701
his attention distorts.

389
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:57,345
Just try to understand

390
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,197
you must have seen, just as tendrils come out of many trees

391
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:06,624
specially the creepers

392
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:11,233
(tendrils) come out and catch hold of this, catch hold of that

393
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:15,027
then slowly and slowly it climbs up.

394
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:18,219
In the same way, a man who is not realized

395
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:22,037
he also catches sometimes this, sometimes that and sometimes that.

396
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:24,247
In this way he some how stands up.

397
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:27,054
Sometimes he thinks that he doesn't have a position.

398
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,734
How will i survive on the earth?

399
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,076
Oh! i don't have money.

400
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,648
How will i survive in the world?

401
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:33,047
Oh! i don't have this

402
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:34,564
How will i survive in the world?

403
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:37,256
But the tree that stands on its trunk

404
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:39,791
looks quite independant.

405
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:42,426
But the same thing is happening to you too.

406
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,384
You are no doubt standing on your trunk

407
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,923
but because of fear you take out tentricles from inside

408
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:54,264
catch hold of this, catch hold of that and so on.

409
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,560
For example, you know where you are standing

410
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:58,159
this is the second thing which you should know.

411
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,913
First thing is that you should not control your attention.

412
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,576
It should not be controlled.

413
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,528
Attention will not be tangled at all.

414
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:08,434
You try, it will never tangle

415
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,772
You try in deep meditation.

416
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,590
You may have any major question.

417
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,935
You look at it.

418
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,626
Just on looking at it, you will be surprised that

419
00:24:17,651 --> 00:24:19,760
 your attention goes there and returns back.

420
00:24:19,785 --> 00:24:21,332
Attention cannot entangle anywhere.

421
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:22,988
Then you just think.

422
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,792
For example, a great sad incident has taken place.

423
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:28,073
You think that here a very sad incident has taken place

424
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:30,371
but the world is going on as usual.

425
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:35,297
Sorrow and happiness is our mind's creation.

426
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:42,139
What is it, that makes us very sad or very happy.

427
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:49,877
Or what is it that we hate someone or love another.

428
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:52,626
There is no such thing which should lead to it.

429
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:59,493
By and by your attention will circulate with a great speed.

430
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:03,807
and then when attention gets fixed, gets absolutely fixed

431
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,292
whosoever we look at

432
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:10,661
you have also seen that by touching somebody, our hands burn

433
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:13,636
by working on somebody, we catch.

434
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:16,183
In the beginning it will happen so.

435
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:18,105
Be away from him.

436
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,553
As far as possible, do not put your hand in the furnace.

437
00:25:20,578 --> 00:25:22,787
When a girl learns to cook food

438
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:27,485
first of all she cooks on a small oven by wrapping a small cloth.

439
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:32,316
when she learns to manage a little, then she starts cooking on a big oven.

440
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,946
In that too, she first holds tongs

441
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:36,776
then handles a TAWA (iron plate to bake bread)

442
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,819
and bakes a ROTI (Indian bread) on it.

443
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:42,093
When she becomes an expert, she makes ROTI with hands.

444
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:45,107
She can put her hand in the oven as well.

445
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:49,262
In the same way, in the beginning what we call an evil

446
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:52,726
what we call bad even that will  (NOT CLEAR).

447
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,695
And what we call evil, will by itself go out wherever you stand.

448
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,423
It won't effect you.

449
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,328
When you will be in such a state

450
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,015
what is the need of Mother's protection?

451
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,964
You will grow yourself.

452
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:11,840
Then you won't catch from anyone , nothing

453
00:26:11,865 --> 00:26:13,098
whosoever may be at whatever place

454
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:14,583
you go and find out nothing.

455
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,486
He who reaches there, is running away from there.

456
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,057
They themselves are not going to stay there.

457
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:21,459
When you achieve that ability

458
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:24,844
that day, these questions are appropriate for all times to come.

459
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,672
But as I had told you that

460
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:29,789
there are only two methods of it.

461
00:26:29,814 --> 00:26:33,669
One is inside meditation, and the other is external (NOT CLEAR).

462
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,929
Now something is going out of your hand.

463
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:41,532
First of all they speak of good KARMAS

464
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:44,034
do good, do bad

465
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:49,310
good or bad is man's thought process.

466
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:51,250
When KARMA becomes AKARMA

467
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,925
means if there is no such feeling that we are doing KARMA

468
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,004
for example, there is light of the Sun

469
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:56,236
what Karma is HE doing?

470
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,660
HE is in AKARMA, but He is doing KARMA.

471
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:03,816
When there is complete AKARMA

472
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,647
 that something is flowing in hand and happening

473
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:10,212
whatever KARMAS of the past have accumulated inside us

474
00:27:10,237 --> 00:27:12,361
it is said that you will have to bear the reward of your actions.

475
00:27:12,386 --> 00:27:13,601
Many sick people come here

476
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:15,245
saying, Mataji these are the rewards of our KARMAS.

477
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,172
Will you take out these?

478
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:19,004
I say, yes I will take these. Don't worry.

479
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,658
When we come to Ganga ji, these should get washed off.

480
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:24,882
If on account of your Karmas your hands and feet are paining

481
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,760
if you have fallen sick and then got some trouble

482
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:30,123
it hardly matters, I can take that.

483
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,571
But your Karmas have travelled from your body to your mind.

484
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,178
How will karmas from your mind dissolve?

485
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:42,332
These are standing outside.

486
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,405
Because of Mataji, your health has improved

487
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,874
but these karmas are settled in the mind.

488
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,082
You have got your realization

489
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,142
still how will this filth come out?

490
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:52,670
So, when you will be doing this karma

491
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:54,735
it will all flow down into akarma.

492
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:59,171
And as much you will do in this lifetime

493
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:07,890
your karma will come to an end.

494
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:10,739
By and by, when you will go on doing Karmas

495
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:12,054
these will go on quiting like this.

496
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,969
After all the cleanliness of your inside being is over

497
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,333
the same feeling of pity inside your being

498
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,465
liking and disliking nothing remains there.

499
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,763
You are sitting, you may or may not get food to eat.

500
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,946
Whatever work you are doing

501
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,057
if you are an executive, or any entity of the world

502
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:33,576
you are doing that work only which is of God.

503
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,006
You are not doing any of your personal work.

504
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:39,957
Its work is being done by your hands and you are unaware of it.

505
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,964
For example, Sun is giving its own light.

506
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:46,747
Moon is enjoying Sun's light within itself.

507
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:52,572
The sea is ascending, descending and sending out clouds.

508
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,157
Their karmas are active

509
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:59,347
but nobody thinks that he is doing anything.

510
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:01,723
There are trees, from trees fruits come out

511
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:04,259
seeds come out of trees and then trees come out of these.

512
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,198
How much occupied they are in such a major work?

513
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:08,979
But none of them that they are doing anything.

514
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,833
Everything goes on smoothly.

515
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,163
Only man has a question.

516
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:15,028
All of them are in harmony.

517
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,538
We have questions

518
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:21,501
because God Himself has given specially this boon of ego to mankind

519
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,098
so that we know Him.

520
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:27,245
But we have seen that ego doesn't die by striking it

521
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,108
So it should depart by itself.

522
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,891
That is the method of Sahajyoga.

523
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,068
It exits by itself, that too you have seen.

524
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:35,601
But what should be done?

525
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:38,473
You should do yourself as much karma as you can

526
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,350
and another is to go into deep meditation.

527
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:47,700
unless you reach that stage where there is nothing called good or bad.

528
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,546
You have seen ME, I go anywhere

529
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,461
neither any negativity catches ME, nor any Bhoot

530
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,709
 neither MY finger, nor MY hand.

531
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,555
Everytime there should be such flow only.

532
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,246
Iif you feel any heat from MY head

533
00:29:59,271 --> 00:30:02,669
that means it is some negativity within you only

534
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:06,070
it is an example in front of you.

535
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,888
I am also like you only, but an example in front of you.

536
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:12,235
In the same way, when you will be Shivji

537
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,447
neither there will be any devil nor a bad being.

538
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:18,293
Whosoever comes in front of you, should get mingled in your love

539
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,058
and if he doesn't get, he will run away.

540
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,630
When there will be such a situation

541
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:25,868
that day you won't need this protection.

542
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:29,428
You only have found out many ways to protect yourself.

543
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,767
Whatever the methods are there

544
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:35,860
if you want they can tell you what they use.

545
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:38,551
Whatever they use or you can ask them

546
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:44,221
for example, (MY) photograph, foot soak, giving bandhan to yourself

547
00:30:44,246 --> 00:30:48,879
to take different names and many other things

548
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:51,640
for that if you want, you can talk to them

549
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:52,963
 and they will tell you everything.

550
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:56,412
But a realized person during meditation

551
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,131
first after sitting must introspect

552
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,769
if there is any catch from what he is receiving.

553
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:03,641
If we are getting vibrations

554
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,356
If there are no vibrations, he should get rid of catches.

555
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,498
How should he take it out and what should he do

556
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:09,201
Sharad also can tell you, these people can tell you

557
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:11,436
how the blocked vibrations have to be cleared.

558
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:14,424
If there is burning sensation in hands, how should it be taken out.

559
00:31:14,449 --> 00:31:16,295
Take it out that time

560
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,162
by taking the name (of the Diety of that chakra)

561
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,682
it will come out.

562
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:21,741
it will come out in such a way that you will feel it was never there.

563
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:24,926
You catch from the atmosphere, from plants, from everywhere

564
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:28,702
Your situation is just like a small girl who learns cooking food.

565
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,228
When you will be expert in this field

566
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:35,209
then only you will be real yogi.

567
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:37,384
Because there will be complete efficiency

568
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,398
you will have perfect knowledge

569
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:41,909
and when you will have perfect knowledge

570
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,703
then you yourself become the knowledge.

571
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:48,365
Tthat means you don't do anything, all this works by itself.

572
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,733
For example, if this (mike) becomes perfect

573
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:54,107
and if MY voice is going perfectly into it

574
00:31:54,132 --> 00:31:56,128
it doesn't have to do anything, doesn't have to know anything

575
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:58,207
it is recorded automatically.

576
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:03,884
Because the speaker and the doer, care taker of all is God

577
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:06,240
and is hovering over everybody's head.

578
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:10,304
Realized souls should know one more thing

579
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,703
it is very important

580
00:32:12,728 --> 00:32:16,104
after knowing this you in a way become dependant on it.

581
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:19,339
God hovers over every realized soul.

582
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:24,837
For example, just as spirits hover over any evil man

583
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:34,820
in the same way, all the Gods are very eager to help

584
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:36,441
those who are realized.

585
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:41,731
They get the fragrance and continuously hover around them.

586
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:45,363
Out of you, those who must have experienced it recently

587
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:47,370
that day she was telling because

588
00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:51,524
her brother in law had been caught up by some spirit

589
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:55,055
and around 3.30 p.m, he started feeling very uneasy

590
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,387
 and he started shouting and screeming.

591
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:58,328
The outsiders too started shouting and screeming

592
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:02,460
and said that after that, such bad ordour and bad smell came inside

593
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:04,318
they could not understand what to do.

594
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:06,731
They started taking the name of that

595
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,149
and after that they started giving vibrations

596
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:10,214
and as soon as he became cool

597
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,134
great fragrance started coming and he became cool.

598
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,879
In meditation, many of you too

599
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:21,070
 before or after realization, get fragrance multiple times.

600
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:23,825
Vibrations give fragrance.

601
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,097
Vibrations give lot of fragrance

602
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:28,511
and mostly ALHAAD DAYINI (inner joy)

603
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:30,191
that gives you fragrance.

604
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,194
So whatever is non fragrant

605
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,292
that can dissolve by itself

606
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:37,753
when you keep your meditative state alright.

607
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,210
Means you are correcting yourself.

608
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:41,563
So, there is nothing to feel bad about it.

609
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,084
You have seen that now a days

610
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,337
while meditating your level is much higher

611
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:47,602
Modi is of a higher level, he and Devde are of higher level.

612
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:50,235
Chandu Bhai is there and there are many such people you know

613
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,539
Shroff Sahib too has ascended much higher.

614
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,082
Our Lal Sahab has ascended a lot

615
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:55,583
Many people have ascended a lot.

616
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:56,652
If I name them

617
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:59,486
I feel mostly people have ascended a lot.

618
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,652
Even then all of them catch a little bit.

619
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,053
Whose name shall I take?

620
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:06,924
Every body catches a little.

621
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:09,123
Sharad had caught up very badly.

622
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:11,556
Three days back, he had caught up very badly.

623
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:13,012
Ok, it doesn't matter even if you catch.

624
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:14,995
But you can understand that you have been caught up.

625
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,365
That is why this is the situation.

626
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,980
That you have caught up, is understood

627
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,285
It is easy to take it out.

628
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,118
For a realized person it is very easy.

629
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:23,365
Somehow it should be taken out.

630
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,588
How to take it out, what should be done

631
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,358
what are the methods to take it out, these people know.

632
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,931
You should experiment it with your ownself.

633
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:33,137
You can take out even by standing in the sea

634
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:36,710
because on getting realization, people would do foot soak.

635
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,650
It is good because

636
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:41,686
they used to get so much worried, their fingers would start burning.

637
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:43,496
There is one Gagan Bhawda Maharaj.

638
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:46,428
When he got his realization, he would sit in water.

639
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:49,369
His fingers' size dimished because of getting burnt.

640
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,698
He had acquired curative powers.

641
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,669
But he didn't know

642
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,202
why his fingers got burnt and why their size minimized.

643
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:59,819
His fingers got shortened on account of burning

644
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,206
because you know, your hands too go on burning.

645
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:03,361
The innocent person didn't know(why it happened).

646
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:05,178
Now he doesn't come to Mumbai.

647
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,966
Because in Mumbai city hands burn so much

648
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:10,423
because his hands may have been burning too much

649
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:12,547
poor fellow didn't know how to set these right.

650
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,264
Poor fellow moved and settled there.

651
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,444
(NOT CLEAR)

652
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:17,789
He settled there.

653
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:20,414
He would keep sitting in water.

654
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,894
At least you have somebody to tell you.

655
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,936
Some knowledgeable person is there

656
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:24,921
to make you understand that there is no harm if your hands burn.

657
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:25,972
Take it (burning sensation) out this way

658
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:27,700
and protect yourself.

659
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,215
My brother in law's hands

660
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,319
got burnt very badly on account of some people.

661
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:34,760
He becomes absolutely nervous on seeing some people

662
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:40,212
NOT CLEAR

663
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:45,105
You think yourself that there is someone to give you this knowledge

664
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,182
some one to convince you

665
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:50,097
that after realization, how much dangerous the situation is.

666
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:53,474
Anyone can catch you , you are absolutely small children

667
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:59,469
and such small children

668
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:05,276
it is necessary

669
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,907
to safeguard your state

670
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:13,799
You are always under MY protection

671
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:16,363
and everytime I take care of you

672
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:19,256
and a lot of love for all of you.

673
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:22,813
Feel proud and also enjoy myself a lot.

674
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,734
That is why I have sons and children.

675
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,947
It is a matter of pride for ME

676
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:28,976
(NOT CLEAR)

677
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:33,044
But what you have got, don't waste that on useless things.

678
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,281
All of you have experienced it.

679
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:41,832
Sometime you ask Yadav, he will tell you.

680
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,970
Just now Mr. Patil came and he was telling ME.

681
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,714
Here are ladies, many of them can relate their experiences.

682
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,530
How did they experience and how did they correct themselves.

683
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,095
If there is any problem, I can definitely solve that

684
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,820
but you also learn to do so a little bit.

685
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,776
You also do, you also learn, you also know.

686
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,661
You are the doctor and you are the medicine.

687
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:04,741
It is going to flow from you only.

688
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,763
Even if you get injured a little bit, doesn't matter.

689
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,253
 Mother is there to set you right.

690
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:10,768
It is not a matter of worry.

691
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:13,106
Such people were not existing earlier.

692
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,935
Because even the people who have got their realization

693
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,101
say how did we get realization, God save us.

694
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,090
Such were the people in earlier days.

695
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:23,642
After getting realization, they would sit with tongs in their hands.

696
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:27,265
It was not their fault. They would beat them mercilessly.

697
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,251
If somebody would come who would burn them

698
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,415
from whom they would get heat

699
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,177
they would beat him with tongs.

700
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,553
They were called CHIMTEWALLA BABA (an ascetic carrying tongs).

701
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:37,177
I have seen them in MY childhood

702
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:40,646
I am so surprised that whosoever comes is hit with tongs.

703
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:43,090
Whosoever is there call ME with great love.

704
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:46,015
I have never hit anyone by any tong.

705
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,539
Who will go to them?

706
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:51,776
Its reason is that there was nobody to explain and make them understand.

707
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:54,031
Now you are curing so many diseases of people

708
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:56,460
you have cured even diseases like cancer.

709
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:58,935
Such type of diseases you have cured just easily.

710
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,698
So many types of negativities you have removed

711
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:02,061
because you have done such a lot of work.

712
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:05,368
It is sure that you will catch something or the other

713
00:38:05,393 --> 00:38:08,967
but there is a dispensary for that also.

714
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:12,248
For you too there is a dispensary and a person who can tell you

715
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,414
and also one who can explain the minutest details.

716
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,518
There is nothing to be afraid of.

717
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,931
Even then, if you are scared

718
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:22,217
that means you cannot proceed further in this life.

719
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,840
This is about realized people.

720
00:38:24,865 --> 00:38:28,225
But we should understand one more thing.

721
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,356
There are many such saints who have died

722
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:33,016
but they are not able to take their birth.

723
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:34,134
Many people are trying

724
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,427
but they are not able to take their birth.

725
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:37,927
Because they are not getting such a being

726
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,336
or may be there is some other problem.

727
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:43,161
Such saints are planning like this

728
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:46,911
that those who can never get realization among us

729
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:48,788
there are so many in our country (INDIA)

730
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:49,889
those who will never get realization

731
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:52,300
because they have their such previous karmas.

732
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:56,792
Some have done planchette [calling spirits]  where they have got stuck up

733
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:59,202
or any such thing.

734
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:02,786
They say that we should come into them.

735
00:39:03,757 --> 00:39:05,917
You will feel some negativity in them

736
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,768
but they are not harmful.

737
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:09,107
There is no need to quarrel with them.

738
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:11,341
Although very clerical people among you

739
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:14,095
will feel it quite strange that how is MATAJI saying such a thing.

740
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,020
Don’t provoke them

741
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:16,377
because if you provoke them then

742
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,742
it can happen that the bhoots can go into them.

743
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,841
Bhoots are already within them.

744
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,530
 If there will be no bhoots then the saints will come.

745
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:23,681
When the saints come, our work will be done.

746
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:26,439
That is why in many people the saints have resided.

747
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,698
They have a great desire.

748
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:31,784
They have expressed it to ME that they want to come.

749
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,479
But if we come in the form of small children

750
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:36,337
how can they help you?

751
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,224
So it is better that such people who come to you

752
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:41,551
and those who are unable to get realization

753
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:42,444
can't see

754
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:43,846
there are many people like that.

755
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:45,613
Even if they are not getting realization

756
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:47,096
there is no need to argue with them.

757
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,407
They will keep on coming always.

758
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:52,026
They will come for four years, for six years or even for ten years

759
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:54,305
but don't argue with them.

760
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,943
They are coming, let them sit.

761
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:58,415
You know they have not got their realization.

762
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,674
A person who has got realization once, will go on getting realization.

763
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,298
But the one who has not got realization and is going in and out

764
00:40:03,323 --> 00:40:04,590
there is no need to get involved with him.

765
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,015
Do you remember (NOT CLEAR)

766
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,939
Only the saints will work on them

767
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:11,007
because without that the work is not getting accomplished.

768
00:40:11,032 --> 00:40:15,217
All negativities will be removed only by saints

769
00:40:15,242 --> 00:40:17,834
because you cannot see these

770
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:20,574
and you cannot go to the other world.

771
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,642
So allow them to do this work.

772
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:25,542
They say that they will come and go on doing the work

773
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,407
and go on spreading MY work.

774
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:30,229
They will not cure any one of you or do anything

775
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:32,171
but they will do such type of work

776
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,642
that they are for example such people with others

777
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,947
they will be more strong in language.

778
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:40,126
They will speak, will drag people ( to Sahajyoga)

779
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:42,511
and bring many more people who want to come.

780
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:45,856
There was such a person who had even written an article about ME.

781
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:49,201
But he was too much scared and he ran away.

782
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:51,078
They are never going to get realization.

783
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:52,907
A decision was taken in his name

784
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:55,003
and he was told to write about ME and he started writing about ME.

785
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:59,209
After that the poor fellow got involved in some case

786
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,173
that there was a different environment

787
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:02,595
and he got involved in that.

788
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,709
Such people should be saved.

789
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,888
Keep them with saints. Atleast they will be well behaved

790
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:09,010
and by coming to Sahajyoga

791
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:10,782
they will never be attacked by any negativity

792
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,131
they won't have any physical trouble

793
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,348
they won't have any mental trouble

794
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:14,510
and they will have wisdom

795
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:16,630
because the saints do not trouble anyone.

796
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:18,921
That is why saints are within them.

797
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,691
but those who are heads of some religious establishment

798
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:22,132
they too are hovering over you.

799
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:23,426
They will help you.

800
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:25,447
They are also helping you.

801
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:28,141
They will protect you a lot.

802
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:31,778
You will have physical, mental and intellectual protection.

803
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,108
He will look after your worldly affairs.

804
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,412
He will pay attention to your household

805
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:38,941
will take care of your family and household.

806
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:42,413
But you should completely surrender to God.

807
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:44,798
There is a great responsibility on you.

808
00:41:44,823 --> 00:41:46,851
Today I wanted that

809
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:49,925
 if anyone has any question or wants to discuss anything

810
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,544
they can do.

811
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:56,288
Mr. Shroff told ME

812
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,393
and you be like a gardener in a garden

813
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:04,321
You have to see how to maintain this garden

814
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:09,111
how to set it, how to plant it, how to maintain it

815
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:11,052
everything you have to think.

816
00:42:11,077 --> 00:42:13,826
You think about it and tell ME how it can be done.

817
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:15,939
One thing he said was correct.

818
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,392
He was saying that if we give realization

819
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:21,742
 and don't do the follow ups

820
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,775
then realization gets lost.

821
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
It is a fact.

822
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:31,659
if we even after giving realization

823
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:35,115
don’t follow up and protect them

824
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,163
we don't take them forward, take care of them

825
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,762
it is quite possible that their realization will be lost

826
00:42:41,787 --> 00:42:43,711
 And then it will awaken after a very long time

827
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:44,944
till then they will be in trouble.

828
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:46,976
So, all of you have to be collective

829
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:49,722
and everybody should meet atleast once a month.

830
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:53,131
Every realized person should meet once every month.

831
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:58,919
Make it such a way that every month a letter should go to each one.

832
00:42:58,991 --> 00:43:01,992
Or publish a newspaper which everyone reads.

833
00:43:02,017 --> 00:43:04,476
It should be distributed for one month

834
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,889
and no money should be charged.

835
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:09,449
Do not pay money anywhere nor borrow from anyone.

836
00:43:09,474 --> 00:43:11,421
Do not get involved in money transaction

837
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:14,052
even for making ashram, the land that Government will give.

838
00:43:14,077 --> 00:43:16,143
Even in that, never think like that

839
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:17,888
then you will grow vegetables in that

840
00:43:17,913 --> 00:43:19,330
and then you are selling vegetables.

841
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:22,183
There is no need of doing all this business.

842
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,865
We don't have to earn money.

843
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,070
Today you must have read

844
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,576
What is the condition of the Chairman of State bank?

845
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:30,144
He went to the ashram, gave him ninety lakhs

846
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,401
20 lakhs were given elsewhere for making furniture.

847
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,908
Is furniture made in ashram?

848
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:35,607
Use your senses.

849
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,564
You please do not make furniture to sell it

850
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:42,684
otherwise tomorrow we will see that

851
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,663
these people are making furniture.

852
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:45,866
There is no need for that.

853
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:48,406
It is forbidden for you to do gardening there.

854
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:49,354
 For this, you can engage a gardener.

855
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,563
For doing such work ,there are many people.

856
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,058
You are here for a special work.

857
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:56,620
You have to help in meditation, vibrations

858
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:59,663
and redressing the problems of others

859
00:43:59,688 --> 00:44:02,915
to give them vibrations, to awaken theiir chakras

860
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,350
and to give them realization

861
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,528
and so far as money is concerned , be away from it.

862
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:09,072
Do not get involved in money transactions.

863
00:44:09,097 --> 00:44:13,680
Money should be arranged, take so much money

864
00:44:13,705 --> 00:44:15,810
and keep its account, there is no need for it.

865
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,859
If you get involved with money and its accounts

866
00:44:18,884 --> 00:44:20,511
you will get caught up always.

867
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:24,810
There is absolutely no connection of God and money.

868
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:27,684
 If someone gives you a place for free, it is fine.

869
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,000
If he doesn't give , no problem.

870
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,393
It is all God's work.

871
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:34,013
If you are sitting at a place, if someone gave you a place to sit

872
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,050
then he was God’s man who gave it

873
00:44:36,075 --> 00:44:38,852
and if he doesn't give, it does not matter.

874
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,954
No one becomes God if he owns a place or land.

875
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,724
There are many ashrams.

876
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,129
You have not to make any ashram.

877
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,931
So, do not pay your attention to that.

878
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:49,233
Please do not pay your attention towards that.

879
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:53,739
That we are going to do this or that, or do business in an ashram.

880
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:55,733
I will never allow this to happen.

881
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,825
And when I see that you are stuck in some business

882
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,362
 then it is not MY responsibility.

883
00:45:00,387 --> 00:45:04,077
You don't have to do any business of any type.

884
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:08,314
You don't have to collect money in any way, for nothing at all.

885
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,628
One person said to me that he will sell MY photos

886
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:13,877
and then that money he will give money to ashram.

887
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:17,342
I said, “Which ashram? Whose money you have to give? Who said so?

888
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:20,362
NOT CLEAR

889
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,302
There is no need to worry about all this.

890
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,348
The One who is doing and looking after us is HE.

891
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:28,839
We are not doing our work. We are doing His work.

892
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:32,489
If HE wants, He will give and doesn’t want, won’t give.

893
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,284
And the same work we do night and day of eating ‘filth’

894
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:38,009
and if we are going to come here and do it, then it is of no use.

895
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:39,947
Don’t give ME ideas like this.

896
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:42,552
Because few people have given it and it pains Me badly.

897
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,731
Please do not give such types of suggestions.

898
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:47,886
That way I am very straight and innocent

899
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,368
but I am very clever as well.

900
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,683
I am not going to be bound by these tricks.

901
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,993
I am telling you beforehand

902
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,453
that if you try to trick Me into money matters

903
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:57,822
I am not going to support you.

904
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:00,545
Whether you get realization or not, it does not concern Me.

905
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,934
First of all, you must realize that

906
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:07,588
there is no connection between money and realization anywhere.

907
00:46:07,613 --> 00:46:10,862
The other thing is that there is no connection of this to politics.

908
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:13,062
There will be such people also who will come to you

909
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:14,826
and ask you to stand for election

910
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:16,668
as you have such a large following.

911
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,598
If you want to go into politics you better go

912
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:22,041
but politics has been created by humans and not by God.

913
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:24,743
If you have to stand at a place that belongs to God

914
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:28,088
it has nothing to do with politics and government.

915
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:30,953
This is the first thing to understand

916
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,244
and it has no connection with position.

917
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:37,800
If you think that you are a very senior trustee

918
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:40,762
here, there are just two to four people

919
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:45,448
but if someone thinks I am a very senior secretary

920
00:46:45,473 --> 00:46:48,583
 or i am a chairman

921
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:53,444
 there is no connection with any ‘chair’.

922
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,679
And neither is there any throne or seat.

923
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:57,088
Remember this first of all.

924
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:58,701
It is to talk amongst ourselves.

925
00:46:58,726 --> 00:47:01,505
It has neither any seat nor any throne.

926
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:05,773
Shree Mataji speaks in Marathi

927
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:11,606
Marathi

928
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,338
No need to make any special seat.

929
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,662
Who is sitting on Adi Shankaracharya’s seat now?

930
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:16,882
Someone who is absolutely non-realized

931
00:47:16,907 --> 00:47:18,055
So nothing doing.

932
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,503
Nobody is going to sit on any vehicle.

933
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:21,400
Everyone is sitting on his own  vehicle.

934
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:22,995
When you sit on someone’s  vehicle

935
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,761
you are always afraid of being removed from that  vehicle.

936
00:47:26,786 --> 00:47:29,105
Sit on your own vehicle

937
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,485
and by ruling over your own selves from your own vehicle

938
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,325
a lot will be done.

939
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,626
Just tie a knot of these few things.

940
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:43,896
Third thing

941
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:49,007
a noble character, good conduct and divinity

942
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,507
 without this you cannot proceed at all in this path.

943
00:47:52,532 --> 00:47:54,830
If you have some bad habits

944
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,090
you will have to make an effort to give up.

945
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:58,257
Take a vow on My feet.

946
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:02,233
Actually, the fact is that now you have shakti within you.

947
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:08,531
For example, Indians have a very bad habit of criticizing others.

948
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:10,319
We are now connected with love

949
00:48:10,344 --> 00:48:11,877
We are all brothers and sisters.

950
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:14,251
If something has happened amongst each other

951
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:16,575
 can be that someone’s foot slips

952
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,042
it is not necessary that you go and discredit him all over the world.

953
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:23,856
Come and tell Me, I can set it right.

954
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:27,304
But to save your brothers even at the cost of your life

955
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:29,213
it is your full responsibility

956
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:35,448
for your brothers and sisters.

957
00:48:35,473 --> 00:48:38,468
For that whatever you have to do, we will have to save him.

958
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,055
It is a moral responsibility.

959
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,694
It does not mean you have to pay money for that.

960
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,287
Do not lend any money to anyone.

961
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:47,664
If someone asks for money don’t give a penny.

962
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:51,128
There is no need to lend money to anyone.

963
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,185
If some person, in his spiritual life

964
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:01,660
where his Kundalini is being destroyed or falling

965
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,167
if someone has got into some bad habits

966
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:07,890
all of you should help with the help of your love.

967
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:12,224
Till the Purity does not come into us fully

968
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,399
 our work will be left incomplete.

969
00:49:15,424 --> 00:49:19,228
You should know this that the eyes of the whole world are on you.

970
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:23,113
By fixing these decorate Diwali with these.

971
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:25,984
People's attention is not on the house

972
00:49:26,009 --> 00:49:29,096
 but on the lamps that burn.

973
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:33,213
The attention of whole world is on every one of you

974
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:35,321
that after all those who have got realization

975
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:36,513
and are curing sicknesses in the world

976
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:37,767
how are they leading their own life?

977
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:44,219
Criticizing this and criticizing that

978
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:45,912
although till now I have not seen such criticism.

979
00:49:46,214 --> 00:49:48,220
Till today there is no criticism against (Sahaj yoga).

980
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:49,744
But there is every possibility of it.

981
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:52,960
If there is any problem, just come and tell me.

982
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:54,924
No one is perfect as yet.

983
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:58,615
So if anyone has any problem, just come and tell Me.

984
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,720
I will cure that problem Myself.

985
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:05,980
And whatever shortcomings you have

986
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:07,799
never feel shy sharing with anyone (your brothers and sisters0.

987
00:50:07,824 --> 00:50:09,702
All of you are brothers and sisters.

988
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:12,850
As soon as you say “This is catching in me”, it can be cleared.

989
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,766
If you don’t tell them how can it be cleared?

990
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:18,931
There is no need to feel bad as you know that every one catches

991
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:23,782
All are doctors and doctors take free treatment among themselves.

992
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:26,310
So all of you can get cured free of cost.

993
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:32,333
You must have brotherhood among yourselves

994
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:35,901
 and keep your attention towards an extremely pure life.

995
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:40,982
So purity is very necessary.

996
00:50:41,007 --> 00:50:42,992
Without that this work cannot be done.

997
00:50:43,017 --> 00:50:45,669
If I had spoken about purity before

998
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:47,404
then it would have been a question of perversion

999
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:50,445
that you clear out on one end and catch on another.

1000
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,874
You clear out on the second thing and you catch a third thing.

1001
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:54,897
But after realization, this problem is no more there.

1002
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:56,424
After realization

1003
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,129
a hole that has been made here ( on the top of the head)

1004
00:50:58,154 --> 00:50:59,856
because of that everything will go out from here (Sahastrara).

1005
00:50:59,881 --> 00:51:05,573
You leave one thing and it will go out from here.

1006
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:09,433
It will go out fully. It is not going to enter anywhere else.

1007
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,846
That is the advantage of the hole that has been made here

1008
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:14,888
Whatever habits you have, keep these in your mind

1009
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:16,627
and then take out from here.

1010
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:19,155
Wherever the habit is, you will feel heaviness.

1011
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,349
On the Nabhi, some like to eat a lot.

1012
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:25,131
It does'n't look nice to overeat. Pay attention to your Nabhi.

1013
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:27,219
Your Nabhi is here, a little higher.

1014
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:31,242
From Nabhi then slowly remove it.

1015
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:36,306
Then everything will come out, all the filth will come out.

1016
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:37,945
The reverse wind is blowing.

1017
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,715
Today, it is blowing from the reverse side.

1018
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,864
Just now Mr. Jode told me that now he breaths from here (top of head).

1019
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:46,930
It is good!

1020
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:50,465
seeing, listening

1021
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,711
smelling, taste everything is from here.

1022
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,934
Finally everything happens due to consciousness

1023
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:58,990
and when consciousness has come on the top of the head

1024
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,402
 then it will be here only.

1025
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:03,309
The beating of the heart

1026
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:06,584
 the work of the whole body is done from here (Sahasrara).

1027
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:10,641
So anything that you want to take out from within yourself

1028
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:13,149
 then just press it and take it out from here

1029
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:15,826
Your habits will go by itself.

1030
00:52:15,851 --> 00:52:18,403
All your habits will be released from here

1031
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,225
because now there is a hole, it is very helpful.

1032
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,650
The hole was not there

1033
00:52:21,675 --> 00:52:24,658
So like they say that if you press the ocean from one side

1034
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,852
it grows on the other.

1035
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:30,267
But if a hole is made in it then it will flow out.

1036
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:32,902
So if you press it on the side, it will not go to the other side.

1037
00:52:32,927 --> 00:52:34,546
It will come out.

1038
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:38,288
Make an effort and look towards yourself

1039
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:41,098
as to what is impure within us.

1040
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:44,070
Like our Mother’s name is Nirmala, so we too have to be Nirmal (Pure).

1041
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:48,280
And what is impure within us, and not within others.

1042
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:50,482
Again we come to the same thing.

1043
00:52:50,507 --> 00:52:53,074
Just now I was watching that some were looking at others.

1044
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,427
 No, no, I mean what is within us. Which “Hum” [Spirit] is it?

1045
00:52:57,452 --> 00:53:01,030
What is it that is within us?

1046
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,032
These are our misidentifications

1047
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:06,563
means that we have thought of ourselves as Christians

1048
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:08,708
we are Muslims

1049
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:11,772
we are Hindus and the rest are useless.

1050
00:53:11,797 --> 00:53:13,696
This is a misidentification.

1051
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:17,495
We Indians are the best, and the rest are useless.

1052
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:23,419
 These all are misidentifications and all are false.

1053
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:28,464
There is just one truth that we are humans.That is the reality.

1054
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,391
First thing is that if you know this answer

1055
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:36,467
then you will understand the rest that you are.

1056
00:53:36,492 --> 00:53:41,320
One must keep watching all your misidentifications each moment.

1057
00:53:41,345 --> 00:53:43,419
What are we thinking at this moment?

1058
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:53,558
We are thinking that I have to go home and make food.

1059
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:57,549
NOT CLEAR

1060
00:53:57,574 --> 00:54:02,987
Some are thinking about what happened in the office today?

1061
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:05,173
What will happen in the office tomorrow?

1062
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,070
People are thinking about various things

1063
00:54:07,095 --> 00:54:09,078
and I know what all they are thinking about.

1064
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:11,607
You should listen to My lecture in Thoughtlessness.

1065
00:54:11,632 --> 00:54:15,852
Not with these thoughts.

1066
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:20,025
The One who cooks for us is sitting here. We do not make food.

1067
00:54:20,363 --> 00:54:22,701
Think about this once

1068
00:54:23,672 --> 00:54:25,707
that when such a miracle has happened

1069
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:28,291
that just sitting here you have gone beyond thoughtlessness.

1070
00:54:28,575 --> 00:54:30,229
We will see more miracles.

1071
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:39,788
Because matter is also made from that same Conscious Power.

1072
00:54:39,813 --> 00:54:44,594
See this also.The Cook is sitting there.

1073
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:48,530
And your questions will get answered like this.

1074
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:51,182
As soon as you go into thoughtless awareness you will understand

1075
00:54:51,207 --> 00:54:53,903
that you have come under the protection of God

1076
00:54:53,928 --> 00:55:01,249
and in thoughtless awareness, this help has come inside your being.

1077
00:55:01,274 --> 00:55:04,196
If you have any questions please ask Me today

1078
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:08,848
But do not meditate today as a lot of time has gone for meditation

1079
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:12,066
Next time we will have meditation.

1080
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:15,659
And at this moment let us have a puja or recite mantras

1081
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:18,316
by which you will be specially given a protection

1082
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,693
by which you will have no problem.

1083
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:22,561
There are many devils roaming around outside

1084
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,403
 and you can get into trouble.

1085
00:55:24,428 --> 00:55:25,559
You must come.

1086
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:27,098
After this, the programme is in Pune.

1087
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,278
Those who want to come to Pune can come to Pune also

1088
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:33,979
but if you attend this two week program, it will be better.

1089
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,876
Now, what I have said, just think about it.

1090
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:39,272
Now with My lecture, you cannot not get conditioned.

1091
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:42,403
Your conditionings will also go away.

1092
00:55:42,428 --> 00:55:44,262
The main point is that it will be over.

1093
00:55:44,287 --> 00:55:47,585
Conditionings will go away from here (Sahasrara).

1094
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,050
After realization, the greatest benefit is that

1095
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:52,213
 nothing will now stick to you.

1096
00:55:52,238 --> 00:55:55,645
Its gross will not stick to you, only its consciousness may stick.

1097
00:55:56,464 --> 00:56:01,984
Even if I speak in Urdu, Farsi or French

1098
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:08,614
but the CHAITANYA that is flowing through the words will come into you

1099
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,537
So with this, the vibrations will flow into you.

1100
00:56:11,562 --> 00:56:14,118
There is no need to understand the language.

1101
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:17,852
The love that is flowing from within is what is touching you.

1102
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,839
Like you may not know the name of the flower

1103
00:56:19,864 --> 00:56:22,126
its honey will go into you.

1104
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:24,042
 the fragrance will flow into you.

1105
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:26,759
The fragrance is the Consciousness

1106
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,860
and the flower is (NOT CLEAR)

1107
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,584
So, even if you don’t understand the name

1108
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:32,328
 the fragrance comes to everyone.

1109
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:35,369
Each human being can smell a flower.

1110
00:56:35,394 --> 00:56:38,871
Everyone can tell, he may be an English, French or Indian.

1111
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,177
Everyone can smell its fragrance.

1112
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,854
It doesn't need any language.

1113
00:56:43,879 --> 00:56:45,120
In the same way

1114
00:56:45,145 --> 00:56:48,841
God’s fragrance which is the Conscious Power can flow into anyone

1115
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:50,040
whatever may be his language.

1116
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:54,299
In this speech what I wanted to say was different

1117
00:56:54,324 --> 00:56:57,602
and what I wanted to give was different.

1118
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,476
That has got established inside.

1119
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,845
 Whatever the problems were, will be taken out from here (Sahasrara)

1120
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,218
 A churning goes on inside

1121
00:57:04,243 --> 00:57:05,000
And on account of that

1122
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:06,289
and whatever the chakra after taking a round

1123
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:07,830
 wants to get rid of throw that out

1124
00:57:07,855 --> 00:57:10,255
take it out with the help of your hand.

1125
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,280
Some may get a heavy head, take out that ( heaviness).

1126
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:15,984
If you are catching from someone, don’t worry

1127
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:19,503
even your heaviness will also go out with it.

1128
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:23,663
Like I said yesterday, take out with the left hand.

1129
00:57:23,688 --> 00:57:33,008
If anyone wants to ask any question, please ask.
