1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,630
Today I was thinking of telling you about 
the ego problem, because I think everybody

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,820
feels that that’s the biggest problem they 
all have; and there’s a big ego trip one

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,270
gets into, and they don’t know what to do 
with it.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:26,530
So first part I will tell you how the ego 
rises and how, what it does to us; the second

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:42,600
how to understand it, how to tackle the position 
of ego and put it in its own aspect.

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,159
As you see in the map here, the yellow stuff 
that you see on top is the ego.

7
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,600
The balloon that is yellow is the ego.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,699
You see down below it starts from the Swadisthana.

9
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:13,810
This is the color of the bile within us, and 
this Swadisthana Chakra which is for our creativity

10
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:21,760
is directly connected to that ego there.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:33,700
And when it starts rotating round the Void 
and going to the various parts of the Void,

12
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:41,040
it collects all the problems of the Void.

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:58,180
Void is that green circle within us where 
physically we have in the Void, we have uterus,

14
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:06,170
we have kidney – it’s a complete viscera: 
all the intestines, ascending, transverse,

15
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:23,599
descending colon, liver, is the upper part 
of liver more, then also pancreas and the

16
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,599
spleen.

17
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,700
So all the problems of these organs are collected 
by this chakra which moves.

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:38,299
It comes out of the Nabhi Chakra and moves 
round and round and round, and collects all

19
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,720
the problems.

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:58,310
It nourishes, gives power, the vital power 
to these organs, and also it generates necessary

21
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,659
power for our creative action.

22
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:19,519
It also collects the fat cells of the Void, 
convert it into the proper cells for the brain,

23
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,709
for its use, for the grey matter.

24
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,599
All this work it has to do, one chakra.

25
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,370
It manifests aortic plexus outside.

26
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,959
On the physical level we call it as aortic 
plexus, and it has got six sub-plexuses which

27
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:45,920
look after all these organs.

28
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,269
This is meant for our action.

29
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:55,099
When we go into action, this chakra starts 
working.

30
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:04,389
By the first power, which is on the left-hand 
side, we desire.

31
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:19,299
But by the second one we go into action, and 
it’s called as kriya shakti.

32
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:32,110
Now when this action starts within us, it 
produces the byproducts or we can say all

33
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:40,180
the problems of these organs, which are to 
be deposited somewhere, and they are all deposited

34
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,240
in the brain as ego.

35
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:59,160
All the problems that we have out of these, 
this creativity and the action of all these

36
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,319
organs are to be counterbalanced, and as a 
counterbalance the ego develops.

37
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,520
For example, now I have to come and meet you 
all here.

38
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:17,090
I had to get out of the house, I had to change, 
I had to drive, whatever it is, then I came,

39
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,780
I had to put in effort.

40
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,419
I had to plan out how I’m going to talk 
to you – that I don’t do normally, but

41
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,860
I’m saying in generally people do it.

42
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,540
And I put in the effort to come in.

43
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,120
Now how am I to justify this, all this effort?

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:49,690
What is the satisfaction that one gets out 
of doing this effort, this kriya, this action?

45
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:59,069
We go on doing some action, and why should 
we do it?

46
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:09,510
After all, action means, any activity means 
exertion, botheration, problems, so best is

47
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,690
to sit at home and do nothing of the kind!

48
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:20,280
But we do not do that, we take up challenges, 
we rush up to it.

49
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,220
All this we do with our kriya shakti, with 
our right action.

50
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,560
Because we do action, we have to have a satisfaction 
about it.

51
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,199
As a reaction to that, ego develops.

52
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,180
If we do not have the ego we would not do 
anything – is a fact.

53
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:51,330
But ego is the one that rationalizes all our 
madness, the rat race we are running into.

54
00:06:51,330 --> 00:07:00,409
If we did not have the ego we would not go 
into this nonsense.

55
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:06,240
The more we try to rationalize our activities, 
the more ego develops to satisfy.

56
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,500
“All right, very good, very good.

57
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,210
Now you are a successful man, see?

58
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,130
You’re a very successful man, you have got 
this, you have got that.”

59
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:22,990
Lots of misunderstandings creep in when we 
pamper our ego like this – or I should say

60
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:32,389
that when we are satisfied with our ego – that 
we really get lost.

61
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,480
We get identified with our ego and not with 
ourselves.

62
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:44,870
So if you do some work very well: supposing 
you have, say, made a beautiful poetry or,

63
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,289
say, not piece of poetry but say you have 
made a very good painting, then you would

64
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,770
like people to appreciate.

65
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,810
If they do not appreciate you, you think you 
have done nothing, though you have done a

66
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,870
beautiful poem – of a canvas.

67
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:08,830
But still you will be so dissatisfied with 
yourself unless and until people appreciate

68
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,830
you.

69
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,940
They must garland you, they must say, “Oh, 
you are great, you are really unique, you

70
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,400
are a genius.”

71
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:27,490
You know many artist who created great art, 
got trapped into this kind of misidentification.

72
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:36,330
When they created some great art, the art 
could not give them satisfaction.

73
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,919
They had to go to ego, and Mr. Ego would not 
be satisfied unless and until everybody says,

74
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,979
“Yes, yes, you are very good.

75
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,671
You have done this, you are a genius, you 
are this, you are that.”

76
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:55,550
That’s how the ego develops then within 
us.

77
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:05,170
But a situation can arise where even when 
we have done nothing, we want to take the

78
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,579
credit.

79
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:15,990
Then we call such a person egoistical who 
says, “I will do this, I have done this,

80
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,110
I, I, I, I” – then we call him an egoistical 
person.

81
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,580
Because he gives words to his ego, that’s 
why we call him egoistical.

82
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,899
But all of us have got this Mr. Ego there, 
sitting on our heads.

83
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:37,320
When it starts bloating, the more successful 
you are, the worse it is.

84
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,029
The more you indulge into planning and thinking, 
the worse it is.

85
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:46,810
The balloon goes on, you see, pumped as if 
you are pumping a balloon, you see.

86
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,399
The more you pump, the more it becomes.

87
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:59,310
And you can never realize that you are not 
that ego.

88
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:06,060
Then you start feeling very nice about it, 
because everybody says, “Oh, what a great

89
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,270
man he is.”

90
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,610
The whole society develops on those lines.

91
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,890
Today only I was discussing about the way 
people give you “C.O.B.”, I don’t know,

92
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:27,030
“V.I.P.” and “M.A.D.” like that, and 
we carry those banners with us.

93
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,850
And we expect everybody should respect those 
banners which have been given to us, you see,

94
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,449
because we’ve done some work, somebody has 
recognized us, branded it, stamped it, so

95
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,089
we believe really this must be something great.

96
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:47,371
So we accept that brand and we want to keep 
it up.

97
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:52,510
So there’s a doubly fixed thing that you 
are really rewarded for what work you are

98
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,870
doing.

99
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,440
That’s why people start become nuisance 
also.

100
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,620
Supposing in a society some people do not 
find any significance to their lives.

101
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,699
Then they will go to Oxford Street, stand 
there, wear funny dresses, start jumping and

102
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:21,690
singing something nonsensical, and people 
make a nuisance out of themselves.We have

103
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:31,050
seen people who paint their hair in different 
colors, put pencils in the noses, I think,

104
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:37,660
and do all kinds of mad things just to attract 
the attention of others; because we want to

105
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,460
attract the attention of others, because our 
ego is not yet satisfied.

106
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,829
But this ego is never satisfied.

107
00:11:47,829 --> 00:12:00,690
It goes on asking for more food, more food, 
and you enjoy it too.

108
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:10,389
When such a ego is bloated within us, we cannot 
understand what we are doing.

109
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:17,070
People can befool you like that.

110
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:25,699
It’s very easy to befool a person who is 
ego-oriented, than to befool a simple person.

111
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:34,339
A simple-hearted man not, cannot be easily 
befooled, because he’s not on a trip, you

112
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,339
see.

113
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,540
But those who are on a ego trip, you tell 
them that this is the best way to go to hell

114
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,100
– they will be the first booking their seats.

115
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:53,970
There will be a queue for it, and people would 
be asking for it, “All right, if it is so,

116
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,970
it’s good.”

117
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,680
That is how many gurus in this world have 
come forward, have befooled you by telling

118
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,040
you that you will get these powers, those 
powers, that will happen, this will happen.

119
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,610
And they know how to pamper your ego.

120
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:16,810
For example, they might say this is a world 
organization of spirituality, and you are

121
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:24,320
the head of the world organization; and you 
believe it.

122
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,130
Ego means misappropriation.

123
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:37,550
You believe in it because you think that “after 
all I must be something, and I have done this,

124
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,940
I have done that.”

125
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,220
But actually what happens physically is then 
when this balloon spreads on your head all

126
00:13:49,220 --> 00:14:01,209
over – the aura of the brain surrounds the 
heart normally, normally; but when there is

127
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:09,589
ego problem, then ego surrounds the heart.

128
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,180
And when ego surrounds the heart, the brain 
is cut off from the heart.

129
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:22,250
So you are a non-integrated person, or we 
can say disintegrated.

130
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:30,779
Your heart runs one side, your brain runs 
another side, your body runs third side, your

131
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,519
emotions run fourth side.

132
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,519
So four people running four horses, and that’s 
how you are completely torn.

133
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:47,230
I mean, it’s impossible to stand on two 
stools, but if there are four with two legs,

134
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,399
it’s a big feat to exist.

135
00:14:51,399 --> 00:15:04,649
So this kind of ego trip comes in, by which 
you start behaving and living in this world

136
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,770
in a very unnatural way.

137
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,230
And if somebody says that “No, not your 
ego, not that.

138
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,089
That’s not you.

139
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:17,420
You have to be yourself.

140
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,130
Ego is not yourself.

141
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,550
Do not be satisfied with this ego,” then 
you don’t like it.

142
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:38,639
Because you are much higher than ego, much 
greater than ego, much more than what you

143
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,129
think your ego can do.

144
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:44,820
With ego what, at the most what can you do, 
say?

145
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:53,339
At the most what can you do with your ego?

146
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,759
What people have achieved through ego?

147
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,759
Nothing.

148
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,579
Whatever they have discovered even in the 
sciences has come from the unknown, from God’s

149
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,000
own treasures.

150
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,310
If God has given you some knowledge of the 
unknown, you should not feel pampered about

151
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,990
it and think that “Oh, this is what we have 
found.”

152
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:26,269
No, He graciously gave you this knowledge 
which has come to you, so just take it with

153
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,279
humility.

154
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,029
And this ego is very, very dangerous for kundalini 
awakening.

155
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:43,920
Now you look at the diagram, imagine the whole 
of your head is covered with that yellow stuff,

156
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,800
and this blue thing becomes a very small one.

157
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,830
So first of all the desire to seek, itself, 
is diminished.

158
00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:04,140
You see, you go for seeking as if you are 
going to a cinema hall.

159
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:10,610
There is no combination of what you are thinking 
and your heart.

160
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,310
You are not seeking from your heart, you are 
seeking just with your brains.

161
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:20,400
Because you have read three, four books, there’s 
a fashion, everybody is seeking, everybody

162
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,350
is looking as if they are seeking something, 
so let us also seek.

163
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:31,090
It is not coming from your heart, because 
you can see that the activity of heart has

164
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,070
become practically zero.

165
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:42,210
You do not desire anything, it is what your 
ego desires you run after.

166
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,350
Anything that doesn’t satisfy your ego, 
you get upset about it.

167
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,600
One must go on all the time saying that you 
are the fastest horse, you are the greatest

168
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:03,260
person, you are the most unique personality, 
then only you are satisfied.

169
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,150
It cuts you out so much from your heart.

170
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:13,909
That’s why we cannot find joy, because joy 
you can only get through your heart.

171
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:22,810
But this Mr. Ego gives you some sort of a 
satisfaction which is very superficial, temporary,

172
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,940
leads you nowhere.

173
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:37,210
With this ego-orientation only you get so 
many diseases, as I have told you before,

174
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:49,260
like diabetes, heart attack, we can say also 
cancer could be one of them, arthritis you

175
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,870
might get.

176
00:18:51,870 --> 00:19:01,280
You also get with this too much thinking, 
paralysis, paralysis is because of that, and

177
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,130
kidney failures.

178
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,850
The worst is liver.

179
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,049
Because of overactivity, liver is neglected.

180
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,990
We are least bothered about the liver.

181
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:24,659
If you tell a child “don’t eat chocolates” 
in childhood – I mean, it’s an impossibility,

182
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:26,940
you cannot talk like that.

183
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,250
I mean, I just once said that why not stop 
giving chocolates to children, who cannot

184
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,380
digest it because their liver is not that; 
or make something that is digestible to their

185
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,520
liver from childhood, till they grow up.

186
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:50,410
And why not dilute the chocolates also a little 
bit more?

187
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,470
So the question comes in then, that “How 
can you do it, Mother?

188
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:02,810
It would be chucking out everything, and children 
would protest without chocolates.”

189
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:08,870
Gradually they’ll forget.

190
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,330
The liver problem starts within you.

191
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:22,529
You become thin, lean, pale, aggressive, all 
the time grumbling, grudging, sulking; never

192
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:27,390
in joy, never in happiness.

193
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:35,690
You call it tension, stress, all these things 
– it’s nothing but overactivity of this

194
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,830
chakra.

195
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,659
Tension is because the whole of it is covered 
with this balloon, and the balloon is still

196
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,630
going on and on and on.

197
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,190
That has to reduce.

198
00:20:51,190 --> 00:21:01,880
Sahaja Yoga is the only way really we can 
face our ego, because through Sahaja Yoga

199
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,309
only we can see ourselves.

200
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,900
But it is an impossibility with human beings 
to face themselves, even after realization

201
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,840
they find it difficult.

202
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:25,070
For example, all our misidentifications are 
there.

203
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,840
Say I’m dealing, say, with English disciples 
here.

204
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,309
Before I start saying about the misidentification 
of the English, I must condemn all the Indians

205
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:42,890
of the world, and all the Japanese, Chinese, 
Greeks, everybody else, and then I should

206
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:48,320
say, “There’s also something wrong with 
English.”

207
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,289
Otherwise I had it!

208
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:59,760
Unless and until at every stage I condemn 
all the rest of the world, I cannot talk of

209
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,360
saying that we also have certain misidentifications 
which are sitting on our heads, by which we

210
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:15,970
are oppressed, we think that this is the correct 
way of life; by which we have oppressed others.

211
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,230
And this ego business is so much prevalent 
in our society.

212
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,190
Now, with all due apologies, I am talking 
about the Western society.

213
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,760
When it comes to India I talk to them, but 
now I’m talking to you and think that I

214
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,279
am also a Western person.

215
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,650
So I can see certain things as a Western personality.

216
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,630
I don’t feel bad about it.

217
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,900
For in the so-called certain traditions that 
we have – today only I was discussing, you

218
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,820
see – like on the table we have to sit for 
dinner.

219
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,271
All right, simple thing it is to sit on the 
table for dinner.

220
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:56,799
Now dinner is there because God has been gracious 
to us; for our well-being, for our friendship

221
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,460
we are all going to sit down.

222
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,890
But go to any formal dinner or you arrange 
a formal dinner, people would sit down, ten

223
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:14,809
times discussing where is the seat of X and 
the seat of Y and the seat of Z.

224
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:23,390
But if there is a slightest mistake in placing 
the people according to their date of birth,

225
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:31,300
their face color, their head color, their 
height, their noses, their length, their upper

226
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,730
lips; any difference is there found in the 
“Who’s Who” book, you see, that somebody

227
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:44,790
was placed little higher in M.A.D. degree 
– then you had it!

228
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,390
All the good wishes of entertaining people, 
of doing some good friendship, of having,

229
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:56,580
creating something very, very great is all 
lost.

230
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:05,169
All the effort is lost, and you are left wondering, 
“Now what have I done?

231
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:08,620
I did consult all the dictionaries and the 
‘Who’s Who.’”

232
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,520
I mean, this “Who’s Who” is another 
ego-pampering, you know.

233
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,010
But despite that there was a mistake somehow, 
and the person has taken a very big objection

234
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:25,890
that Mr. X, who is one day junior to him, 
has been made to sit ahead of him.

235
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,360
It’s the greatest calamity to his ego.

236
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:39,270
The poor chairs do not know what happens for 
their different shapes, you see!

237
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:46,180
How much we fight over all such things, pampering 
our ego.

238
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,500
So on and so forth, we have so many things.

239
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,669
But if I say “Scrap all this nonsense,” 
why don’t you scrap it?

240
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:59,360
Why to have all this, protocols, this, that?

241
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,299
What is the need to have this seat for this 
gentleman, that seat?

242
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,241
After all, if there are ten people for dinner 
they can find their seats, there won’t be

243
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,980
a chaos for ten people.

244
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,950
Even for twenty people, even for three hundred.

245
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,409
Why should there be seat allotted?

246
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:20,860
If you have invited three hundred people, 
all right, they’ll all sit down.

247
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,820
If they are remaining they’ll sit down for 
the second one or for the third one.

248
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:33,980
What is the, such a hurry of having that program 
altogether, or in such a systematic way that

249
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:40,480
everybody feels unsystematic after that, everybody 
feels disturbed and upset after the program

250
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
is over?

251
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,539
With all the system, with all the corrections 
and with all the great planning we do, ultimately

252
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,860
we find all have become nitwits.

253
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,190
There must be something wrong about it.

254
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,820
And it becomes a frenzy, with mob-like behavior 
people have, you see.

255
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,710
Everybody will come out with very big faces, 
“Oh, what a mismanagement, you know, they

256
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,020
did this.”

257
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,480
What is it?

258
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,530
One can’t even understand what is the value 
of these things.

259
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,669
That’s why we have to be like small children.

260
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,450
To them it does not matter where they sit.

261
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:30,720
And so we are grown-up and matured, supposed 
to be mature people also; while children are

262
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,880
still innocent and still ignorant, and still 
they have to grow up.

263
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,539
We are supposed to be up-grown: what has grown 
within us is nothing but this Mr. Ego, not

264
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:46,020
you.

265
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:54,110
When this happens, when this happens in the 
worst possible way – you know, today’s

266
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,100
paper I was reading about this Ripper.

267
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:07,710
Now the conclusion is reached that he’s 
not a psychopath, but he is on an ego trip.

268
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:16,580
He’s doing all this for his ego satisfaction, 
because he telephones to the police, he sends

269
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,809
a, what you call a tape to the police that 
he should be caught.

270
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:27,130
He tells them “You’ll meet me here,” 
and still they cannot catch him.

271
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:32,820
So he thinks, oh, he’s such a great person 
that nobody can catch him, the greatest thief

272
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,710
ever born who could not be caught.

273
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:44,279
So that is what you call – he’s not a 
psychopath, but I don’t know what name will

274
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,299
you give to such a man.

275
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:52,450
I mean to a egoist like this, the one who 
lives by ego, tries to satisfy his ego, and

276
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,620
if his ego is not satisfied by something, 
he doesn’t feel satisfied.

277
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,990
I don’t know what should you call him.

278
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,360
Now, how to overcome this ego?

279
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,970
Because people start seeing gradually this: 
it happens.

280
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,790
They start seeing Mr. Ego, “Oh, very great, 
you see it’s coming up, giving me ideas,

281
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,790
all right.”

282
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,300
You feel sometimes very depressed with the 
idea that this is Mr. Ego I was identified

283
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
with.

284
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
All right?

285
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,320
You see your ego.

286
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,580
Then when you see your ego, then what do you 
do with it?

287
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,520
Or if somebody says “Better watch your ego,” 
then what happens?

288
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,919
You start fighting it.

289
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,289
You say, “No, I will not say anything, I’ll 
just keep quiet.

290
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:42,320
Let them say anything, whatever they like.”

291
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,409
Then you’ll become another type.

292
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,549
You become a person who is suffering from 
superego.

293
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:58,970
So you are left with desires, but do not act, 
and you’d say that “Let others aggress

294
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,970
me, I’m not going to aggress anyone.

295
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,269
I’ll be very careful about non-aggression.”

296
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:09,700
But by this kind of a thing, what happens 
that when you raise the left side – I mean,

297
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,730
left side which goes up on the right-hand 
side, superego, it presses the ego down but

298
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:23,280
again is bounced back, and there’s a kind 
of a bouncing going on.

299
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,890
By this behavior when you fight your ego, 
the ego sits on your head much more.

300
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,250
The more you try to fight ego, it sits on 
your head.

301
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,769
You are not to fight it.

302
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:42,490
Supposing you take a balloon and start hitting 
it, it will hit you back further.

303
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,880
Go on hitting it, it will go on hitting.

304
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,360
Now, which is the way to deflate this ego?

305
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,770
How do we deflate a balloon?

306
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:02,480
In the same manner, take a pin and give it 
a prick.

307
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,900
You just look at yourself, say, “All right, 
Mr. So-and-so, now how do you do?” and you

308
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,909
laugh at yourself.

309
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:18,929
You said, “Oh, you were very unhappy, you 
see, when you saw that you were not placed

310
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:19,929
very much.

311
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:27,510
All right, now have a pin from me!”

312
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:34,429
And that’s how you deflate it, by seeing 
it, by all the time making fun of it yourself,

313
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:41,700
and piercing a pin into it.

314
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:49,059
Not by deflating, in the way people say that 
you deflate the whole thing by pushing it

315
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:57,279
down or by killing it, but actually just making 
a hole in it.

316
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:07,769
In the same way, if you start looking at yourself, 
and make fun.

317
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:13,950
Human beings only know very well how to make 
fun of themselves.

318
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:19,230
No animals know that.

319
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,130
If you learn how to make fun of yourself, 
your ego will go down.

320
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,840
Otherwise this ego will suggest whatever you 
are doing is the best, “This has to be done,

321
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
that has to be done.

322
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,700
I am the best, I am doing everything good.”

323
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,570
And you might be torturing someone, aggressing 
someone, you might be just playing into the

324
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,370
hands of ego like a madcap.

325
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:45,420
And you might be a real madcap, but you don’t 
know that you are.

326
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:53,330
Because with ego a person becomes successful, 
so-called, he becomes very brilliant, shines

327
00:31:53,330 --> 00:32:01,700
out, in competition he comes up; and nobody 
dare say a word to him, otherwise he’ll

328
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,270
have punch on the nose, you see.

329
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:11,519
So also he becomes very mighty and powerful, 
and everybody hankers after such a behavior

330
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,370
and such a thing.

331
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:23,120
But a time comes when he realizes that “I 
was hanging in the air.

332
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:34,510
I forgot my basis, and now I have to come 
down,” like Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,

333
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,720
and they had a great fall.

334
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,090
Such a beautiful … this thing is, written 
long time back.

335
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:52,389
And all the men … all the king’s horses 
and all the men could not put Humpty Dumpty

336
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,660
back again into its own shape, you see?

337
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,910
So don’t be Humpty Dumpty, and don’t live 
with that idea of being a Humpty Dumpty.

338
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:12,170
Is a simple thing to fight your ego.

339
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:18,860
And that happens very often in Sahaja Yoga, 
is a very common happening in Sahaja Yoga

340
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,970
where your kundalini itself, you see, creates 
such situations that you are flabbergasted

341
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:25,970
at your ego.

342
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:36,529
You don’t have to judge others, just see 
yourself, because it is for your own good.

343
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:40,350
If somebody is egoistical it makes no difference 
to you.

344
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:44,139
Or non-egoistical, makes no difference.

345
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:49,769
Only thing is, you should really see for yourself 
what is good and what is bad.

346
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:52,240
That’s how it works out.

347
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,940
Otherwise, as I always say that when I give 
a lecture immediately we start thinking of

348
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,250
somebody whom we think to be egoistical.

349
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,540
Actually I’m saying to each one of you to 
see it, would be a better idea.

350
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:12,550
Now this ego when it covers your entire head, 
the complete Sahasrara which is shown there,

351
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,140
the white area gets covered.

352
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:23,470
Your brahmarandhra, the portion from where 
the kundalini has to pierce also gets covered.

353
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:29,120
It’s very difficult, the whole thing is 
covered and this is small here, the gap is

354
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
here.

355
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,610
Now you cannot open the gap here.

356
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,470
You have to open the gap here.

357
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:41,940
So this has to go back like that, and this 
has to come up in the center like that.

358
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,170
Then only kundalini can come up.

359
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:51,850
So what happens at such stage, you will find 
such people have a left hand very weak, and

360
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:55,710
right hand throbbing.

361
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:01,890
So you raise their left, put to the right 
side.

362
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,820
Again raise their left put to the right, again 
raise their left put to the right, so you

363
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,210
bring down the ego like this.

364
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:24,380
And once the ego comes down, then this comes 
up and the gap comes in between, and then

365
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,580
you raise the kundalini in the center.

366
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:35,270
Kundalini will come out, and then you tie 
it up.

367
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,590
This is Shri Vidya.

368
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,020
This is the knowledge of Shri, of the Holy 
Spirit.

369
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:51,600
All other knowledge of where you have to sit 
in protocol, what you are, is all avidya and

370
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
nonsense.

371
00:35:52,600 --> 00:36:02,160
Reading “Who’s Who” I don’t know what 
you will become, monsters or maybe some sort

372
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:11,250
of a Frankenstein-style personality.

373
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:20,870
This is the vidya, Shri Vidya is the secret 
vidya of the Holy Ghost, by which you balance

374
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:29,010
your ego with superego, your desire and action 
should be equal; and then raise the kundalini,

375
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,040
put it up and tie it up.

376
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:49,840
All these days people who been realized souls, 
great people, have tried to point out the

377
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,100
problems of ego, have talked to you.

378
00:36:52,100 --> 00:37:00,690
They said, you shouldn’t have ego; ego is 
the worst thing, one should not be identified

379
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,640
with ego, and all that.

380
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,240
And as soon as they have said it people have 
started just finding out how to do it, and

381
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,780
in doing so they have become great “gurus” 
– themselves egoistical.

382
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,460
The fact is, you do not do anything.

383
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:33,810
This is not ego, but is a mirage of ego that 
you have got.

384
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:39,510
You really do not do anything – everything 
is done by God.

385
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,870
He is the Doer, He has the great Ego.

386
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:53,380
Your ego is just a copy, made artificially.

387
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,810
Like He creates the flowers, and you make 
plastic flowers and say, “Oh, we have created

388
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,810
flowers.”

389
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,490
He does everything.

390
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:10,610
It is He who expresses His ego, while you 
feel you have done something.

391
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:17,220
It happens to you when you get realization, 
when your kundalini pierces the brahmarandhra,

392
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,630
then you find the power flowing through you.

393
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,600
And when you put your hands at somebody you 
find the kundalini rising there, and then

394
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,850
you find that you can feel the centers of 
that person and catching of his centers, and

395
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,850
you’re amazed.

396
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,850
You said, “Mother, how is it?

397
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,380
Just now was nothing, suddenly what has happened 
to me?”

398
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,380
Because your ego has subsided and has become 
one with that of God, and you are giving vent

399
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,090
to that power of God.

400
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:52,801
You are playing the role of an instrument, 
of a hollow personality, and through you is

401
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:57,930
passing the power of God which is doing the 
real work, while you are thinking “I’m

402
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,700
doing it,” without getting realization.

403
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,310
But after realization you just feel, “Oh, 
it’s flowing through me.

404
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:14,800
I can see it flowing, I can see it working, 
it is …” You’d start talking in third

405
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,350
person, you don’t say “I.”

406
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,220
You just say, “It’s going, it’s coming, 
it’s not there.

407
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,760
This is catching, that is catching.”

408
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,190
It is in the third person you talk.

409
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,570
You do not say “I am catching.”

410
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:35,490
You do not say also that “I have risen the 
kundalini,” you say “The kundalini has

411
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,490
risen.”

412
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,310
Who has risen it?

413
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,470
You never say that you have raised the kundalini.

414
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,970
You just say, “The kundalini has risen.

415
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,140
It is not coming up.

416
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,790
It’s just going there,” as if you have 
become an instrument of some power which is

417
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,440
flowing through you.

418
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:06,220
And this is how we become one with that, and 
all our karmas dissolve into akarma.

419
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,560
Karmas are only the effect of our false idea 
of our ego.

420
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,740
When there is no ego, where are the karmas 
going to be?

421
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,270
If there is no one who is doing and the doer 
is lost, then who’s going to do the karmas,

422
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:32,000
and who’s going to take the load of the 
karmas upon themselves?

423
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,160
Like when there is an organization, then it 
says, “I have got assets and I have got

424
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,090
these debts, and these are the things,” 
you see.

425
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:52,850
But the association or that organization disappears, 
then who has the debt?

426
00:40:52,850 --> 00:41:01,590
In the same way, you as ego disappear, and 
there is no effect of your karmas – all

427
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,590
finished.

428
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:08,500
All that was when one Mr. Ego was there.

429
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,970
When Mr. Ego has gone, all liabilities have 
gone with him.

430
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,130
We are something different now.

431
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:19,730
Now we have become the Self, the Atma.

432
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:32,550
And when we have become the Atma, then we 
are one with that Universal Being, and He

433
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,750
is making us do everything.

434
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:45,940
Like My fingers don’t have ego that I’m 
doing something and I’m touching the thumb,

435
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,130
because it is a part of this body.

436
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,470
Our nose does not have an ego that it is something 
special which is breathing.

437
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,700
We say “I breathe,” we don’t say “this 
nose breathes.”

438
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:07,240
Neither the nose would say this mouth with 
which we eat food, it never says that this,

439
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,520
“I eat because of my mouth.”

440
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:19,430
When you become one with that whole, then 
you just feel that the whole is working and

441
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:28,620
we as part are working with it; and all the 
responsibilities are finished.

442
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:40,910
This is a little talk about ego today, because 
I felt I should tell you that in kundalini

443
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:49,810
awakening so far in the West, we have always 
faced this problem of ego.

444
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:57,250
Also of superego; those who have been to the 
gurus have been possessed by their gurus.

445
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:07,360
And these come as a relief to ego-oriented 
society, because you have been, a horse has

446
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:14,220
been running, all right, and you have been 
running on the horse.

447
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,850
So somebody comes and says, “All right, 
now, I’ll tie you up to the stomach of the

448
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,780
horse and I’ll be sitting on the horse myself.”

449
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,990
This is the possession part of it.

450
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,250
So you feel relieved, you know, quite relieved: 
after all, you don’t have to ride the horse,

451
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,810
you don’t have to jump.

452
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,620
And the rider becomes somebody else, you see, 
you feel also that there’s no responsibility,

453
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,110
the rider is doing it.

454
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:49,590
But after some time under the belly of the 
horse, you start having all kinds of physical

455
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:50,590
problems.

456
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,260
With superego you have physical problems.

457
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,200
That’s why is better to have superego than 
to have ego, because you know you don’t

458
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,480
want to have any more of physical problems.

459
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,960
But if you have ego you never get physical 
problems, or physically you may improve; you

460
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,370
know, you feel very fine, on top of the world, 
you see.

461
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,710
That is the biggest problem.

462
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:20,570
But you get mental problems: you can’t sleep, 
you go on thinking, thinking like mad, you

463
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,400
cannot stop thinking.

464
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
You go on arguing that it should be done.

465
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,240
You think that everybody should do your work, 
while you are the most important person ever

466
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,830
born.

467
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:48,420
So we have only one choice left, is to be 
in the center, to watch your ego and superego.

468
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,880
For all the Sahaja yogis who are realized 
have to watch themselves, not others.

469
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,760
You should not expect anything of others, 
just expect something of yourself for a change.

470
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:10,530
With ego you do that and expect something 
of the others, in superego you do for others.

471
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:23,490
But in Self-realization you emit your Self 
as joy, love and beauty.

472
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,490
May God bless you all.
