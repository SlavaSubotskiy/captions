1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,320
Today is a great day for all of us,

2
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,200
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

3
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,920
That in sixteen beats

4
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,640
or sixteen movements

5
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,600
you reach a higher position in the poem.

6
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,720
That it is complete,

7
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,280
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

8
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,680
because He has sixteen petals.

9
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,000
This completeness is called as "purna."

10
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,360
So, now we move into another dimension.

11
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:49,640
The first one was where you got your Self-realization.

12
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,040
In the evolutionary process,

13
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,200
if you see, the animals are not conscious

14
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,440
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

15
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,600
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

16
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
for their own purpose.

17
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,320
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

18
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,120
If you show a mirror to animals

19
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

20
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,800
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

21
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,920
That means that we are rather close to them!

22
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,560
So, when we have become human beings,

23
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,400
we became aware in our consciousness

24
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,040
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

25
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,440
So, in their brain they did not understand

26
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,240
that they could put matter into their own use.

27
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,400
As human beings you were all unaware

28
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,040
of the chakras that existed within you.

29
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,600
So your consciousness still was working

30
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,360
halfway through unconscious

31
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:54,320
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

32
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,000
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

33
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,760
or your inner organs, how they're working.

34
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,520
You did not even feel how

35
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,880
you are getting affected by other influences.

36
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,240
As a result of that,

37
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,720
with the freedom that human beings achieved

38
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,240
or were granted,

39
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,440
they gathered all kinds of things

40
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,120
into their brains, into their Sahasrara,

41
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,280
without being aware of it.

42
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,480
They used their Sahasrara, their brain

43
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:47,280
for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless.

44
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,240
They were not aware, again,

45
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,080
of the warning that Shri Krishna had given

46
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,920
that if you use human awareness except for your ascent,

47
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,320
you will go downward.

48
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,760
They were told. Not that they were not told.

49
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
They knew about it.

50
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,720
Whether it was East or West, everybody knew

51
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,680
that you have to be born again.

52
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,200
And it so happened that in the West

53
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,680
people thought that by using their brainpower

54
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,440
they can now master the matter;

55
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,040
that they can use matter for their own purpose.

56
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,760
If they had done it after their Self-realization,

57
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,800
it would have been a very different situation,

58
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,440
because after Self-realization

59
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,200
you all have become aware of vibrations,

60
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,920
which is chaitanya, and also of your chakras.

61
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
With this new awareness,

62
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,160
you would have avoided all that was wrong.

63
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
But it is like a greedy person,

64
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,040
who gets a wee bit of money and he spends it off.

65
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,760
Now this problem has complicated your brains.

66
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,000
You have certain concepts, which are very much away from reality.

67
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,280
The way we have started using machines,

68
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,400
we have become machines ourselves.

69
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,680
So we have no feelings and we cannot relate

70
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,120
to others in a natural way.

71
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,120
In human awareness you had achieved

72
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,880
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

73
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,680
But this ego-oriented approach

74
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:27,800
took you away from natural, real life.

75
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,800
And we became artificial.

76
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,640
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

77
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,520
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

78
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,040
This is just the opposite of your ascent

79
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
and evolutionary process

80
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,640
because you have lost the power to relate to others,

81
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,720
which you had gained as human beings.

82
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,400
All the organizations which you have formed

83
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,280
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

84
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,000
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

85
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,600
That is another copying of the artificial.

86
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,080
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

87
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
Natural is to evolve.

88
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,560
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

89
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,720
So the another concept also that you accepted very easily

90
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,040
because you have got brains

91
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,760
and you accept everything that comes your way.

92
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,760
And you became so artificial that you needed all the time

93
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,760
some sensations to feel yourself.

94
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,520
Now in every walk of life

95
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:48,720
there is a conceptual, artificial understanding.

96
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
For example you see the sex,

97
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,760
which is such a natural, normal thing.

98
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,640
There is nothing so great about it.

99
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,520
But that also you made so artificial

100
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
that you have now your sex in your brain.

101
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,320
By that not only you have silenced Ganesha in the Mooladhara,

102
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,480
but also Mahaganesha in your brain.

103
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,320
In another aspect, say art.

104
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,760
Now the concept is so stupid

105
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:11,800
that it says that art should be according to what is laid down.

106
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,880
Whatever is laid down about art,

107
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
that art should be such, such, such.

108
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Like you will call somebody as baroque, condemn it,

109
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,160
then rococo, this, that. Condemn everyone.

110
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,720
And ultimately you reach a conclusion

111
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,040
that the most insipid thing is art.

112
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,040
As if, like the sugarcane, when you have taken out all the juice,

113
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,360
whatever remains will become art one day.

114
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,920
So the brain, which does not nourish the heart

115
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,480
is absolutely an artificial brain, just like a robot.

116
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,040
So people have become just like robots.

117
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,280
Now this can be handled by anyone

118
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,880
who has a mastermind.

119
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,640
Because you don't have your own heart

120
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,760
and the brain is controlled by somebody

121
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,680
who has a greater brain of concepts.

122
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,880
All these concepts are destructive.

123
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,040
Say Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan

124
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,400
and he is of the superior race.

125
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,720
And to establish that, he did not mind

126
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,080
destroying the whole world.

127
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,240
Same is the case in the religion field.

128
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,320
There also, every religion was put

129
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,640
or poured into the cups of concepts.

130
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,160
Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved,

131
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,560
is that money is everything.

132
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,240
First they tried for political domination,

133
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,160
thinking that political domination is everything.

134
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,520
And now they feel that money is everything

135
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,760
and all other sublime things are imaginary.

136
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,400
So, when I started My life,

137
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,240
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

138
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,120
And the more I tried to solve the complications

139
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,560
within My own awareness,

140
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,400
the more it became more difficult.

141
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,520
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

142
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:12,080
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

143
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,080
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

144
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,440
within these sixteen years

145
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,480
I found that they are now incorrigible.

146
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,200
Now the stage for you is laid down

147
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,600
to ascend higher.

148
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:22,240
This is the background which I have described to you.

149
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,760
And you can see how, when you have a program,

150
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
there will be 500 people for the program

151
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,720
and within two weeks all will disappear.

152
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,640
Because when the ascent takes place,

153
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,120
the Kundalini pushes out the ego

154
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,640
and brings the person close to reality.

155
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,280
But again that ego, which is being built up so fast

156
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,000
in its speed, overpowers the speed

157
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,400
of the Kundalini and covers the head.

158
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,400
Then it suggests that, "how can you have godly life?"

159
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,720
You will miss all the alcohol, all the madness,

160
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
all the fun of life.

161
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,520
That they feel, they will lose all the freedom to become mad.

162
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,080
When you see from this position

163
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,200
the way people react, it is amazing.

164
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,800
You have to do something extremely stupid

165
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,160
to sell it in the market.

166
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,880
The other day I heard that somebody has become rich

167
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:08,880
selling the empty tins as lamps.

168
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,560
All kinds of stupid things,

169
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,440
which are nowhere near natural beauty

170
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,960
or natural joy, are accepted as sophisticated.

171
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,920
The other side of it is that the asuri vidya,

172
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:58,120
the black vidya has taken over.

173
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,480
As Shri Krishna again had warned that,

174
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,760
in the fifteenth chapter, that if asuri vidya takes over,

175
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,000
then the suddha vidya cannot compete

176
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,200
with the speed of asuri vidya.

177
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Like in America there has been a big

178
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
argument amongst Sahaja Yogis

179
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,800
if My photograph should be in the drawing room or not.

180
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,360
But if you ask them to paint their nails black,

181
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,560
their faces black and black clothes like witches, they will do it.

182
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,320
That even at the stage when we are Sahaja Yogis,

183
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:40,400
we are shy of our godly life.

184
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,080
When they became hippies or when they became punks

185
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,720
or they became anything like that stupid,

186
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,200
they gave all their life,

187
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,720
all their time, all their money to it.

188
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,320
They changed their dresses, they changed their lifestyles,

189
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,240
they changed their family life, everything they changed, went all out.

190
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,600
I mean, and even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about

191
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,880
the godliness of Sahaja Yoga, still they are shy.

192
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,680
Now you know your Mother doesn't take any money from you,

193
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,040
on the contrary She spends, you all have gained out of it.

194
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,360
But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy.

195
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,800
From that background you are coming to the light of God's grace.

196
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,160
But you don't want to dash at it,

197
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,720
you want to take your time, gradually,

198
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,400
so gradually that maybe you may lose your chance.

199
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,600
So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis

200
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,120
where you know all about your chakras,

201
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,000
you know about vibrations, you know how you relate to others,

202
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,960
still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

203
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,280
So, the shadow of the past still lingers on,

204
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,040
even when you have this new awareness.

205
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,560
Animals can swim automatically,

206
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,520
they don't have to learn.

207
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,600
But human beings have to learn to swim.

208
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,520
So they had forgotten the techniques which were known to the animals

209
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,640
and have taken to the techniques of human beings.

210
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,640
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got

211
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,680
your realization in one lifetime.

212
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,040
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

213
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,560
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

214
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,880
So the time is so very short!

215
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,280
And the background is so dark.

216
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,560
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

217
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,320
morning till evening destructive concepts.

218
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,120
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

219
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,680
much faster than all of them.

220
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,680
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

221
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,720
that your awareness is very different from them,

222
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,560
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

223
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,680
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,480
Every one of you must think every day:

225
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,480
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

226
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

227
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,360
of making money, of have relations with people

228
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,160
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

229
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,560
We have to make an all out effort

230
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,560
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,

231
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
we believe in, we act on that

232
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,160
and become one with it.

233
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,960
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

234
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:14,520
this is the problem, I mean ... I'll explain this point.

235
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,160
Like supposing a fanatic believes

236
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,680
that he can do such and such thing

237
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,080
in his own religion, he will do it.

238
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,600
When the concept is not reality,

239
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
it has given no benefit to anyone,

240
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,680
has shown no performance of any substance

241
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,600
still people do it.

242
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,960
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

243
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,920
My father himself gave up all his property,

244
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,280
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

245
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,200
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

246
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,440
for days together, for years together.

247
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,080
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

248
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,400
but for the subtler freedom

249
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,360
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

250
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

251
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,240
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

252
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,000
You are the ones who are very much higher

253
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,760
than the rest of the humanity.

254
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,400
That the salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you.

255
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,720
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

256
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,720
So, first of all you have to be conscious

257
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,280
in your consciousness that you are so important,

258
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,640
and that's why you were given realization.

259
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,720
How can you be living with your conditionings

260
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,160
and with your ego?

261
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,920
The conditionings are like this:

262
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,920
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

263
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
then you must bring that

264
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,200
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

265
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,280
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

266
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,400
you want to bring some out of that.

267
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,440
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

268
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,000
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

269
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,520
All these things are like dirt over

270
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,240
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

271
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,120
Though now you are aware,

272
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,200
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

273
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,960
you do not keep them clean.

274
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,040
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

275
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,960
they have houses, they try to keep it clean.

276
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,200
But you do not feel ashamed

277
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,560
of them also when they are bad,

278
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,360
because after some time

279
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,960
you also lose the awareness of them.

280
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,360
That means you have become subtler,

281
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,120
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

282
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,040
There are so many things you know more

283
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,280
than the people who are not realized,

284
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,400
as absolute reality.

285
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,520
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

286
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:22,200
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

287
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

288
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,600
we start giving bandhans.

289
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,480
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

290
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,440
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

291
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,120
otherwise, in your central nervous system

292
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
you are not yet so conscious.

293
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,040
This is the reason, why you do not know

294
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:24,920
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

295
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,200
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

296
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,720
you cannot go further.

297
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,640
For example, I know everything what I do.

298
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,320
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

299
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,440
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

300
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,480
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

301
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,440
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

302
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,960
I know about everyone of you.

303
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,320
I may not know your worldly names,

304
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,720
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

305
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,240
I also can behave like a human being,

306
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,120
absolutely like you, aging like you,

307
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,160
even using spectacles,

308
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:33,160
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

309
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,560
I have accepted this role consciously,

310
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,960
not unconsciously.

311
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,560
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

312
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:58,000
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

313
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,040
you have to be alert about it.

314
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,960
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

315
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,080
the peace.

316
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,480
But even now I find that peace

317
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,160
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

318
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,560
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

319
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,600
It is a homogeneous thing.

320
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,960
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

321
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,680
We are unconscious about our fingers,

322
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,800
but when we have to hold something,

323
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,360
all of them come together and work it out.

324
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,160
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

325
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:35,400
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

326
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,400
That is what evolution is.

327
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:10,560
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

328
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,960
You must learn to face the reality,

329
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:34,120
to accept the reality and act a real way.

330
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,640
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

331
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,120
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

332
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,800
Maybe for the human beings,

333
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,200
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

334
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,120
but not for Me

335
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,120
'cause I know what it is.

336
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,520
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

337
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:29,200
one has to see how you are working it out.

338
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,960
The whole system of relating to

339
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,720
each other must change completely.

340
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,440
That is very important, at least for western people.

341
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,120
Because at least in India people know

342
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,080
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

343
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,200
you have to take to your ascent -

344
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,280
I mean the real Indians.

345
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,560
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

346
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,080
and then disappear, some of them do.

347
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,280
But mostly they know that you have to be

348
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,800
conscious of what you have got.

349
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:27,160
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

350
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,800
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

351
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,920
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

352
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,160
say of some great saint.

353
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,920
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

354
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

355
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,400
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

356
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,920
If your names are taken, why not the vibrations flow?

357
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,400
And in this you have greater advantages

358
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,520
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

359
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,440
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

360
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,000
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

361
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,040
Sometimes French is small, sometimes so big.

362
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:25,360
Now, in expression, when we say something,

363
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,400
when we express; are we natural,

364
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,920
are we it doing from our heart?

365
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,280
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

366
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,880
is what I want you to achieve.

367
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,360
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

368
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,160
others will just take it for granted.

369
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,400
They do not want to help.

370
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,080
They want everything to be ready-made.

371
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,160
That shows that they are not conscious

372
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,520
of their own powers of enjoyment.

373
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,120
If they do it from their heart,

374
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:49,760
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

375
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,320
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

376
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,480
or what they have achieved.

377
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,640
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

378
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,240
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

379
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,320
Now the second stage would be

380
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:45,320
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

381
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,200
where there will be no mistakes.

382
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,280
Whatever you will do

383
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,000
may appear to be a mistake, will turn out to be all right.

384
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,920
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

385
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,040
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

386
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,400
they think I'm saying it to them.

387
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,520
Now for example, today I had My watch,

388
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,880
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

389
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,720
say, simple thing.

390
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,600
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

391
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,160
but quite consciously.

392
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,760
Because watch stopped and I knew the time,

393
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,920
what time I have to be there for puja.

394
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,560
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

395
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:41,200
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

396
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,360
But that was not the time I had to come.

397
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,240
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

398
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,880
So whatever mischief you play,

399
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,160
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

400
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,040
And then you can make a drama.

401
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,600
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

402
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,200
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

403
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:47,320
Just now the stage at which we are,

404
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,080
we are still making lots of mistakes

405
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,800
because we are not Self-conscious.

406
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,120
In a gross way we understand

407
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,160
this word self-consciousness like this:

408
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,400
When a person has to go for an interview

409
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,480
then, he selects his suit properly,

410
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,800
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

411
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,680
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

412
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,440
But when it is the question of your ascent,

413
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,200
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

414
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,560
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

415
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,320
put us in the cradle and take us there.

416
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,880
This is being childish!

417
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,720
You have to mature in your ascent.

418
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,080
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

419
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,000
Face yourself every day!

420
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,120
In reality, see how much time you spend about

421
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:43,160
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

422
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,080
Have you left everything, all your worries

423
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,760
to God Almighty?

424
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,520
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

425
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:34,520
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

426
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,080
And how do I relate to others?

427
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,320
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

428
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,600
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

429
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,080
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

430
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:17,040
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

431
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,920
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

432
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,640
pays more attention to the negative people

433
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,200
than to the positive.

434
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,000
He relates better to the people who are negative

435
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,880
than to the people who are positive.

436
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,560
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

437
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,480
than with the positive.

438
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,600
You have to cling on to the positive.

439
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:31,880
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

440
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,640
All these subtle understandings

441
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,920
I have told you many a times.

442
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,800
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

443
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,960
like a spoiled computer,

444
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,720
you can reach some conclusions

445
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,880
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

446
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,160
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

447
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,600
A simple thing.

448
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:37,280
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

449
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,120
That is as if you should not understand

450
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,360
why you're behaving like this?

451
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:56,360
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

452
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:08,040
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

453
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,120
which has got love in it,

454
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,680
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

455
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,880
This complicated brain is to be put right,

456
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,720
and the best way is to stop thinking.

457
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,680
Just stop thinking.

458
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,200
That's what you have to do.

459
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,080
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

460
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,080
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

461
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,440
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

462
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,120
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

463
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,120
Can you hear My thinking?

464
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,800
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

465
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,440
Then you just start thinking about it,

466
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,520
"I have to enlighten."

467
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,400
Will it get enlightened?

468
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:03,000
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do it.

469
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,920
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

470
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,160
and is used to avoid work.

471
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,440
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

472
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,400
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

473
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,560
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

474
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,280
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

475
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:57,360
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

476
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,080
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

477
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,600
She was a western lady.

478
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,800
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

479
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,040
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

480
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:24,360
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

481
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,400
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

482
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,600
the cleverness.

483
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,440
So you do not argue about it.

484
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,320
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

485
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,120
You do not argue with your leaders.

486
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,040
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

487
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,920
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

488
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,880
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

489
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,680
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

490
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,680
they have nothing to do with that.

491
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,200
Supposing you are working in an office

492
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,120
and the husband is some great official

493
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,320
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

494
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:09,200
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

495
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:15,280
nourish the husband with love

496
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,040
from their heart and not from their brains.

497
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:41,120
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

498
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:47,800
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

499
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,120
The emotions of My love,

500
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,360
the working and the play of My love.

501
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,920
It's so great

502
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:23,800
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

503
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,440
So the women should not feel degraded

504
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,880
if they have to look after the heart,

505
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,240
but they are in a higher, in a way,

506
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:54,960
in a higher aspect.

507
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:03,200
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

508
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:11,200
So the ladies should not argue

509
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,600
with their husbands if they are leaders,

510
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:25,280
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

511
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,120
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

512
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,480
the men become deaf.

513
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:41,960
They just don't listen what women are talking.

514
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,680
If they are very aggressive, then the men

515
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,680
become absolutely shut up.

516
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,520
So in relationship with each other,

517
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,040
you must behave in a natural way

518
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,160
that you are a man and you are a woman.

519
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,760
You should become more a woman and more a man

520
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,400
and then you will see the fun.

521
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,240
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

522
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,960
what would have happened?

523
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:59,120
So we have to know that in our awareness

524
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:04,480
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

525
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:13,880
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

526
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:28,920
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

527
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:36,000
that is of Sahasrara.

528
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:44,360
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

529
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,000
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

530
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,480
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

531
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,160
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

532
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:24,440
according to the Deity, surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

533
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,400
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

534
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,200
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

535
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,520
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

536
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:02,280
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

537
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:26,320
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

538
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,640
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

539
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,960
And it's so, so simple for you,

540
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,560
because you have the Deity,

541
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,240
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

542
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,600
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

543
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,640
have seen that Deity.

544
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,760
They say that you have to ask for three things

545
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,480
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

546
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:34,960
meaning to see God, salokya;

547
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:38,120
samipya, the closeness with God

548
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,520
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

549
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:58,520
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with God

550
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,280
which is not in the concept of any one

551
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,360
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

552
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:26,280
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

553
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:36,720
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

554
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,520
they are no more.

555
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:04,280
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

556
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,200
You must understand your greatness

557
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,400
and you must understand how you people

558
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:30,040
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

559
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:43,120
So now there's no time for lethargy.

560
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:51,080
Now you have to rise and awake.

561
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,520
Today is the day when I hope

562
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,440
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

563
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,680
But only by effort you will stay there,

564
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,440
otherwise you'll again slip down.

565
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,400
So go through this lecture again and again,

566
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,280
and do not think about it.

567
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:51,360
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

568
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,280
For all of you,

569
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,880
each of you,

570
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,040
and you must know yourself

571
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:05,600
how far you are going every day.

572
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:20,280
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

573
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:27,320
Actually, if you see, it is according

574
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,280
to the sun calendar,

575
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,680
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

576
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,640
It's a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

577
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:53,120
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

578
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:03,440
So one has to know that the calendar of God

579
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:08,400
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

580
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,400
According to certain calendars,

581
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,320
I should have come two thousand years later

582
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,240
and some think I should have come

583
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,560
at least two thousand years back,

584
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,200
in this form.

585
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:50,200
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

586
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,080
everything is all right.

587
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:04,240
You are not robots, you are not machines,

588
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:12,960
you are evolved through evolutionary process.

589
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:19,160
And through evolutionary process only

590
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,760
you have to achieve the higher personality.

591
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:37,360
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

592
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,480
it's you who have to show the results.

593
01:25:55,280 --> 01:26:03,040
We may take your Sahasrara

594
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:08,920
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

595
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:24,920
So you have to know that whatever heights

596
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:30,120
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

597
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,480
with full will power and action.

598
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,480
May God bless you!

599
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,360
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

600
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,880
Do not take it as anything ill.

601
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,160
I could not have said this even two years back

602
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,280
or one year back, because you are at the stage

603
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,960
where I can say these things to you.

604
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,080
You can understand it, but

605
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,440
it has to become your consciousness.

606
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,320
The stage has reached to understand,

607
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,600
but it should become your consciousness.

608
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,720
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

609
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,400
So, again, may God bless you!

610
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,360
There are some very new people. Excuse Me because

611
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,960
I had to say these things today.
