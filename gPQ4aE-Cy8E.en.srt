1
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:41,826
So now we will be going for our further movement
and I may have to return back to Bombay.

2
00:07:41,926 --> 00:08:01,597
I do not know how comfortable you were here,
but you wanted to be away from the maddening

3
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:11,417
crowd and I thought this would be the nice
place to be here though Dhumal was all the

4
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:16,767
time insisting that they should stay in some
Mangalkaryalay or something.

5
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:22,937
But I told him, “You don’t understand
them, they don’t enjoy much of all this

6
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:23,937
cement, concrete.”

7
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:39,337
They would always like to be in the company
of nature as long as they get some protection

8
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:46,647
from the sun and the rain and they want to
enjoy that kind of a collective living and

9
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,647
they’ll be very happy.

10
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:52,507
But still I don’t think he was very much
convinced about it, very hesitant.

11
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:59,267
Then again he came to Bombay, I again told
him, “Now believe Me, you have to have it

12
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,267
somewhere.

13
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:05,477
You just have a pendal for them, they’ll
be very happy, you just don’t worry about

14
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:06,477
other things.

15
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,117
They want to be with the nature because they
don’t get a chance like that.

16
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:15,097
They cannot take bath in a lake anywhere,
it’s a great chance for them to take a bath.”

17
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:19,917
They said the water is not so clean and maybe
that it is full of clay.

18
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:25,917
I said, “Clay is good for them, they’ll
like it, there’s …” And I see your skin,

19
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:32,607
it’s so much better, I see your skin, you
see all this you have suffered the sun burnt,

20
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:38,987
whatever you overdid in Ganapatipule, is now
being cleared out by this clay because the

21
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,997
clay is the one that soothes you.

22
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:46,457
Even if you can put some clay on your stomach,
it will take out all the heat from your stomach,

23
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:49,367
very good for liver this clay is.

24
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:55,327
So, I told them that you don’t understand
that this natural naturopathy that they can

25
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,357
have here, they cannot have it.

26
00:09:57,357 --> 00:10:03,497
But he very, very reluctantly agreed thinking
that I’m really trying to be hard on you.

27
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:24,787
So, this is a mild sun here and it’s nice
and the atmosphere is very clear and clean,

28
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:30,157
plus you have got such a beautiful temple
of Ekadesha Rudra here which is such a nice

29
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,077
place we have found out.

30
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:38,367
So for a saint, you see, for a saintly person,
what does he need?

31
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,417
Because he’s so satisfied with everything.

32
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:42,367
Whatever he gets he’s satisfied.

33
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:50,527
But he will be more satisfied, he would be
much more enjoying when he’s with the nature.

34
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,137
I know that.

35
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:57,997
And, they are not still very happy the Rahuri
people that they think that this is no way

36
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:01,637
of putting up guests like this and all that,
still.

37
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:08,087
I just had to tell him that you see their
faces, how they look, they look so very happy,

38
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,107
so very relaxed, now what do you want?

39
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:14,417
What do you want more?

40
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:20,877
But now we must understand that one habit
that we have always, we have developed it

41
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:22,387
because we have been going out.

42
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:26,917
Our attention has been going out.

43
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:30,407
You see the one habit that we have in the
West, which I have noticed also, very common,

44
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:37,456
is, to be a daredevil for everything and to
go to the extreme.

45
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:39,436
You see there’s no …

46
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:45,046
[Shri Mataji asks a yogi] How do you say to
the bridle?

47
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:50,896
Bridle you say, the one that is used for the
horse?

48
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:52,097
Bridle.

49
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:53,566
The bridle is not there.

50
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:56,366
There’s no bridle, in our behavior.

51
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:59,176
We go to extremes in everything.

52
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,866
Whatever we do, we go to extremes.

53
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:08,736
There’s no bridle in our hands and this
is what, one has to get to the bridle.

54
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:22,407
It is not that, it’s like a kite which is
just moving here and there, it’s not that.

55
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:30,606
It’s a complete thrust, complete movement
with all will power, with all effort, to go

56
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:34,756
to something that is dangerous.

57
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:42,796
I personally think it’s a self-destructive
character which is built within us as a result

58
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,627
of our movement too much outward.

59
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:52,396
Because whatever moves in one direction has
to recoil back, it has a reaction.

60
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,616
Like the science has developed atomic bomb.

61
00:12:55,616 --> 00:13:03,377
Ultimately you do develop a destructive temperament
and that is why I think in the west people

62
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:09,736
have no idea how to control the speed backwards.

63
00:13:09,736 --> 00:13:15,337
It’s more the speed outward to dangerous
places they like it.

64
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:17,146
Nature is good.

65
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,837
In the nature it’s nice to be there.

66
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:26,676
But it does not mean that you should ask the
nature to hit you and kill you.

67
00:13:26,676 --> 00:13:31,456
Now in Ganapatipule I was so sad to see those
boys who burnt themselves.

68
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:37,627
It was really very, very saddening to Me and
when I treated them, of course they got well

69
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,717
but you wont’ believe the whole of My stomach
here, [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER STOMACH]

70
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:51,576
the whole skin of My stomach was burnt, charred
and burnt and is now peeling out, just like

71
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:56,576
they had the problem, I never went to the
sea, I never stayed there.

72
00:13:56,576 --> 00:14:01,057
So, this was the heat they were carrying.

73
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:09,717
Now people get, say, what you call, skin troubles,
skin cancers.

74
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,907
Still they want to do it.

75
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:19,786
Like the other lady who was so sick from Switzerland
is so sick, you see, I was really very worried

76
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:27,126
because she was very dangerously placed and
she is the one who had this problem and she

77
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:30,407
said, “I have an addiction with the sun.”

78
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,926
How can you be addicted to the sun?

79
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:36,127
Is just a mental idea.

80
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:43,896
And believe Me, it’s just a mental idea
that if you go in the sun your skin will be

81
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:44,896
all right.

82
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:46,676
It’s just a mental idea.

83
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:53,087
Have you seen anyone like that?

84
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:58,837
I mean what is the proof that if you go in
the sun your skin will improve, what is the

85
00:14:58,837 --> 00:14:59,837
proof?

86
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:07,027
We Indians never, never go in the sun.

87
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,027
Never.

88
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:16,247
We never go in a windy place, never in a windy
place, we never go, say for example this skiing.

89
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,186
According to us skiing is a stupid job.

90
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:21,076
We would never do it.

91
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:27,356
Any Indian who does that is a stupid fellow
according to us.

92
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:33,446
Women will never do horse riding because it
affects the uterus.

93
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:38,796
The women don’t swim after sometime because
it affects the uterus and if it affects the

94
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:49,196
uterus, it affects the whole system because
uterus represents your Kundalini.

95
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,127
All wrong ideas you have got.

96
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,857
That’s why I see that in the West everybody
is sick.

97
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:59,507
They have this trouble or that trouble or
this or that.

98
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:05,577
Certain principles are to be borne in our
mind because we are saints and we are precious

99
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:06,577
things.

100
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:11,327
We are not like other Westerners, that we
can waster our life like this for some sort

101
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:14,637
of a stupid venture that we think of .

102
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:17,947
Can you imagine all Indians have much better
skin than you have.

103
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:19,627
All right.

104
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,317
Don’t they?

105
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:26,167
Do they ever go in the sun?

106
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:29,867
Never.

107
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:33,717
Have you seen any Indian sitting outside here
taking sunbath?

108
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:40,787
I mean the proof of the pudding is that despite
all that your skins are so bad.

109
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:47,247
Now how can your skin be good with the sun,
let us see.

110
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:52,507
Let us say, Let us take absolutely a chemical
reaction.

111
00:16:52,507 --> 00:17:00,357
Now what happens that when the, the thing
falls upon our skin or upon our head, this

112
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:04,397
head has got a brain and the brain is made
of fat.

113
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,397
All right?

114
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:10,497
Now if you put the fat in the sun, what will
happen?

115
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,027
It will melt.

116
00:17:12,027 --> 00:17:15,577
And that’s how people have melted brains.

117
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:23,117
The brains are not normal, they behave in
a way which I don’t understand why they

118
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,187
behave like this.

119
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:32,857
So first of all if your brain goes out, how
can your skin be all right?

120
00:17:32,857 --> 00:17:35,667
Because the brain controls the skin.

121
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,667
It controls everything.

122
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:48,337
If your brain goes off, I’ve not met one
person who looks beautiful because he has

123
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:53,587
been in the sun.

124
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:58,887
On the contrary, you stay at home.

125
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,137
Preserve your skin by staying at home.

126
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:10,927
The second point is that a Sahaja Yogi should
not behave like other Westerners do that at

127
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,797
every holiday, they’re out.

128
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:17,457
They never sit in the house.

129
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:18,457
Gruhastha.

130
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,797
The one who stays in the house.

131
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,357
We are all Gruhasthas, householders, we are
married people.

132
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,597
As soon as you get a holiday you’re out.

133
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:31,897
Now you might give an explanation, “Because
you see our houses are like this and, we think

134
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:36,047
that our houses are just suffocating us.”

135
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:39,737
Have you seen the houses of the poor people
here?

136
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,747
Have you seen the houses of the labor in Bombay?

137
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,277
Nobody goes out for a holiday.

138
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:52,907
All My life I don’t think I’ve been ever
out for a holiday with My husband.

139
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:57,147
Only once we tried for two days and we were
back from Scotland all the way.

140
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:04,297
We just go for a wedding or a festival or
something like that.

141
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:08,387
If there’s some collective happening or
else you can go for a picnic, all of you together.

142
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:15,527
But you must sit down in the house and talk
to each other nicely, there should be some

143
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:16,527
rapport.

144
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:19,917
There’s no rapport between the children
and the parents, there’s no rapport between

145
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:29,477
the husband and the wife, no rapport between
the in-laws, other people, no rapport at all.

146
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:37,127
So you become people who are absolutely secluded,
shooting off this way, that way, that way.

147
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:40,927
Sit down and talk.

148
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,877
Now you see our children, now we talk that
our children should be disciplined.

149
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:50,907
The best way to discipline your child is to
make the child sit down for a while and talk

150
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,337
to the child properly.

151
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:59,967
Tell the child what he’s supposed to do.

152
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:02,987
You’ll find an Indian child goes to somebody’s
house just keeps quite.

153
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:05,197
But let an English child come.

154
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:12,417
He will break this, he’ll break that, give
me chocolates, give me this, I want this.

155
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:18,537
You take an Indian child, maybe a poor child
to a market, he’ll never ask for anything,

156
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:19,537
demand for anything.

157
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:20,537
Never.

158
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,487
Even if you give, he’ll say, “No, I won’t
have.”

159
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,407
He has that self-respect.

160
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:30,457
But if you take a child, any other child,
he’ll say, “Please buy me this, please

161
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,817
buy me that, please buy me that.”

162
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:37,657
Without any self-respect, without any discipline.

163
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:40,617
Now where does the discipline come up?

164
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:45,837
Now what we do, supposing a child is there,
we are going out, we tell the child, “Now

165
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:53,707
we are going out, and you have to be a self-respecting
child because,” supposing now you are talking

166
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:57,917
you can say, “You are a realized soul, you
are a Sahaja Yogi and you can’t behave like

167
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:04,007
a stupid fellow asking for this and that,”
and sit down quietly, make them sit down.

168
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,787
To begin with, you have to do lot of massaging
on their body.

169
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:15,617
Lots of massaging, everyday massage, massage,
massage the body so the nerves are all right.

170
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:24,377
Then, when you take them out or do anything,
before hand, tell them properly, build up

171
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:29,277
their personality of self-respect, of discipline.

172
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:33,587
But you yourself should be disciplined, now
you are sitting in the sun, say, for the whole

173
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:37,737
day and you tell your son, “Get inside the
house,” how will he?

174
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:41,157
A Sahaja Yogi should never go in the sun.

175
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,637
Take it from Me.

176
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:45,387
Never, never go in the sun.

177
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:53,487
Because this brain requires complete quietitude
and no sun activity is needed.

178
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:57,787
You should not even, when you sleep, there
should not be even a ray of sun.

179
00:21:57,787 --> 00:22:03,047
Even I, when I sleep I want complete darkness.

180
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:08,778
Even a slightest ray of light is coming, which
people know very well, I cannot sleep, because

181
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:11,687
I must act.

182
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:18,677
So the reaction to this light is so much in
Me, maybe that I’m very sensitive to all

183
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:22,987
the elements but what about you?

184
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:30,027
You must avoid the sun’s light as much as
you can when you sleep and also should not

185
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:32,547
sit in the sun for such a long time.

186
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:38,607
Of course sitting in the sun helps you because
it gives you Vitamin D, by which, Vitamin

187
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:43,687
D if you take it you build up your bones better
but now I think your bones are quite built,

188
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:46,527
there’s no need to build your bones anymore.

189
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:53,316
But now by God’s grace you are getting soluble
calciums which you can eat and you can also

190
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:56,797
have Vitamin D and A if you want to.

191
00:22:56,797 --> 00:23:00,087
What is the need of scorching this head?

192
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:08,017
Now, if you sit in the sun, then either you
will have a bald head or you will have a jungle

193
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,017
in the head.

194
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:12,307
One of the two thing’s depending on the
personality as you are.

195
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:20,177
Because your brain cannot bear it, your skin
cannot bear it.

196
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:25,537
After all we are not jungle people are we?

197
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:31,077
But you ask any jungle person also, he never
sits in the sun.

198
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:40,407
It’s only somebody has cooked it in your
head that you must sit in the sun.

199
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:53,227
If you go and see Eskimos who live in the
ice houses, they never bathe in the sun.

200
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:56,587
Have you ever seen them sunbathing?

201
00:23:56,587 --> 00:24:02,797
Have you ever seen them?

202
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:06,527
Any picture, anywhere?

203
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:13,457
Then why this special type of stupidity is
there among other people because you have

204
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:21,617
lost that sense to know that you are maneuvered.

205
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:25,957
You see, how to befool you.

206
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:31,566
Now you must create some weaknesses for people,
if you don’t create a weakness how will

207
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:34,457
they prosper with their machineries?

208
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:37,356
So now, let’s befool them.

209
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:44,876
If you go to the seashore and you tan your
body, you look very beautiful?

210
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:50,837
First of all, you never, you look horrid,
horrid you look and secondly they will say

211
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:58,996
that your health will be all right so everybody
is going to the seashore, ending up with a

212
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:00,886
skin cancer.

213
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:06,247
Because your body revolts against it that’s
why you get skin cancer.

214
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:08,256
You get liver troubles, already you are liverish.

215
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:14,807
You are already thinking too much, why do
you want to have sun?

216
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:19,487
You’ve already too much sun within yourself.

217
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:24,167
So what is the reasoning for it?

218
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:26,126
I just don’t understand.

219
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:32,406
You must know that today we have the work
of the Sahasrara and the Sahasrara is the

220
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,177
brain.

221
00:25:34,177 --> 00:25:41,126
We have to work on the brain and if you people
do not know how to use your brain properly,

222
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:44,587
I don’t know what am I going to do.

223
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:50,417
Moreover today, talking to some Indians, I
discovered some horrifying things which I

224
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:58,756
must tell you, which is horrifying as well
as laughed at They were telling Me that if

225
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:04,846
you take an English hen and an Indian hen,
there’s a tremendous big difference between

226
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,067
the two.

227
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:13,846
The hen that is Indian, if she sees another
hen being attacked she’ll make such a noise

228
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:20,647
that all the hen will join together and will
start making noises so that if there’s an

229
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:24,057
attack the master will come and try to remove
the attack.

230
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:30,677
But if it’s an English hen, she will just
watch another being eaten up you see and then

231
00:26:30,677 --> 00:26:33,606
she’s eaten up also, she says, “All right
you eat me, doesn’t matter, I’ll take

232
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:35,127
second birth and come back.”

233
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:39,896
See they’ve no brains at all.

234
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:46,636
You see they have no brains, like say an English
bullock, they have English bullocks also.

235
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:50,347
I mean English means Western, they don’t
mean anything else but he’s Australian,

236
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:55,616
maybe anything, is English to us because we
had known only English so we say English.

237
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,636
But that’s what they say English but it
doesn’t mean anything, it means any Westerner

238
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:03,106
or any Australian or white skin person.

239
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:06,927
A bullock is there, he said, “Our bullocks
if you tell them.

240
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:11,016
‘go straight,’ they know; if you tell
them, ‘go left,’ they know; if you tell

241
00:27:11,016 --> 00:27:14,016
them, ‘walk this way,’ they know;they
know everything.

242
00:27:14,016 --> 00:27:17,116
But if you have any of these bullocks, they
don’t do anything.

243
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:24,077
You tell them go further, you teach them anything,
nothing, they will never learn any thing.

244
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,337
You tell them, they’ll go the way they want
to go.”

245
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:29,437
So very surprising, I said, “Really?”

246
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:35,226
“Yes” they said, “It is so, they are
for no good, they can just do what they want

247
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:36,736
to do.

248
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:40,547
They cannot understand what you’re talking,
they have no understanding about it.”

249
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:41,947
Imagine about the bulls.

250
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:47,087
And then think of it, in India, you see we
have everything walking on the street, we

251
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:51,837
have got the bullocks and we have got the
cows, we’ve got sometimes the hen, everything

252
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,917
goes on the road.

253
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:57,447
They know which side the thing is coming,
which side they have to move, there’s a

254
00:27:57,447 --> 00:27:58,447
car coming.

255
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:04,077
He said, “Put one English cow, they’ll
be all finished on the road.”

256
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:09,232
I got such a fright you know when I heard
it.

257
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:15,136
I said, “They do not do sunbathing.

258
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:19,756
How do they get it?” then I was thinking
that the kind of the food you give them, there

259
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:25,477
must be some horrible hormones, they must
be spoiling their brains.

260
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:29,697
But we are very destructive, I must tell you.

261
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:35,467
Drugs, now we started taking to drugs, in
the name of God.

262
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:40,437
I mean Indians, you make them take drugs,
they’ll say tell another, I know what it

263
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:41,437
is.

264
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:44,156
And then our brains go off with drugs.

265
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:49,837
Brains are not normal, why we behave like
this I can only explain that they have taken

266
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:54,417
drugs, I’ve seen people who have taken drugs
I just don’t understand why, there’s no

267
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,417
logic into their behavior.

268
00:28:55,417 --> 00:29:02,386
Just no logic, they just, like the brains
of a bullock, they behave the same way.

269
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,487
You just can’t explain why they behave.

270
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:04,827
They have taken drugs.

271
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,727
Now what is drug taking?

272
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:07,886
Is again self-destructive.

273
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:11,547
Because you want to destroy yourself that’s
why you’ve taken drugs.

274
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:15,286
Otherwise how many Indians you have known
who take drugs?

275
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:26,167
I’ve never even seen them.

276
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:35,406
And another thing, Dhumal told Me, I mean
he says his reading is he says that if a child

277
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:39,786
is educated in a vernacular school, I was
also educated in a vernacular school because

278
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:43,707
My father was very particular, “Nothing
doing, no English schools.”

279
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:48,486
And those who are educated in the English
schools, there’s such a difference, he say’s

280
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:52,947
he has his children educated in the English
school and he has his children educated in

281
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:54,117
a vernacular school.

282
00:29:54,117 --> 00:29:56,016
The youngest one is in the vernacular school.

283
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:58,256
He says he knows about everything.

284
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:06,266
He’ll know how many cows are in the house,
he will look after parrots, he knows how the

285
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:09,587
parrot works out, how the things are, he’s
the youngest.

286
00:30:09,587 --> 00:30:14,516
He knows about everything but other children
they just will stand.

287
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:20,577
If you tell them, they’ll give an explanation
and then they say, “So what?

288
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:21,577
So what?”

289
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:26,786
But if you tell him something, immediately
he will know what is to be done, he’ll just

290
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:33,596
get it done the way he wants to do it, in
the sense that it must be done.

291
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:35,127
But here the other way round.

292
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:40,307
If you tell a child from an English school,
he will do the way he wants to do and if you

293
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:45,276
tell him, “Why did you do this way?” he’ll
say, “What’s wrong?” or at the most

294
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,517
he’ll say, “I’m sorry.”

295
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:47,517
Finished.

296
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:50,417
I mean like Sahaja Yogis will pull their ears,
finished.

297
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:55,057
Even if he hit’s you, he’ll say, “Pull
my ear’s Mother, I’ve hit You.”

298
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:56,167
It’s like that.

299
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:59,917
It’s very funny thing, I said what’s wrong
with the language?

300
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:04,136
Why this English language makes people like
that?

301
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,136
I can’t understand.

302
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:06,136
Why?

303
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:08,486
I just didn’t understand.

304
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,896
“What’s wrong?”

305
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:16,016
Now this is not in any Indian language, you
see if you say, they’ll say, “What?

306
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:19,906
We didn’t understand, what are you saying,
‘What’s wrong?’”

307
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:27,146
I mean just, the whole, I think the language
itself has the disciplining in-built, it’s

308
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:36,307
a what you call Mardav, it builds up the personality.

309
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:40,406
Like if somebody tries to show off.

310
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:43,136
You see, immediately we’ll say, “You are
over wise.”

311
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,376
Ati Shahane.

312
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:46,927
And the saying is, “Ati Shahane tyanche
baila rikame.”

313
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:54,906
Those who try to show that they are very intelligent,
their bullocks have no work, means they’re

314
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:56,136
lazy lumps.

315
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:59,836
The whole language system is such.

316
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:05,386
They’re so practical I tell you, they’re
so practical.

317
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:11,447
And that is why, we came to India first of
all, we had some Sahaja Yogis with us when

318
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:18,807
we came here about twenty-five Sahaja Yogis
from England came and we all stayed here and

319
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:23,707
all these people looked after them and they
fed them and of course I mean, they had paid

320
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:26,136
no money, nothing they lived there.

321
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:31,636
Nobody even wrote a letter of thanks so they
all got worried and they wrote a letter to

322
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:36,107
Me saying that Mother what has happened, are
they all right or are they sick?

323
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:38,396
They have not written any letter to us.

324
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:42,276
So I called them, I said, “Did you write
any letters to them?”

325
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:43,276
“No”.

326
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:44,276
I said, “Why?”

327
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,477
“We know, we know, we did wrong, we know.”

328
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:49,156
“You know, then why did you not do it?”

329
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:53,036
“No but we know.”

330
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:58,656
Now what is an argument here?

331
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:03,636
Now you have come out of that, what I’m
giving you, the background.

332
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:12,057
You have come out of it, now you are Sahaja
Yogis, you are saints, so you have to be very

333
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,057
different.

334
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:20,756
You can’t be like them.

335
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:23,406
You have to understand.

336
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:29,707
Like some people have a habit of saying, “Ah,
Mother I’m so badly off.”

337
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,707
You ask them, “How are you?”

338
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:34,096
They’ll say [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] like this, it’s

339
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:38,457
very common, so I look at their hands, what’s
it?

340
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:39,717
I don’t understand.

341
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,607
What does that [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] mean?

342
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,447
Here people will feel ashamed to say.

343
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:48,317
Even if you are sick, even if you are dying.

344
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,317
If somebody will ask, “How are you?”

345
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:50,317
They will say, “I’m all right.

346
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:51,317
I’m all right.”

347
00:33:51,317 --> 00:34:01,996
Nobody will do like this [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS
HER HAND INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] Means what?

348
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:04,536
You ask them “What’s your name?”

349
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:05,917
“Did you ask my name?”

350
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:09,937
“Of course I did, but why do you ask Me
again?”

351
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:15,177
Any question you ask, they will repeat it,
always.

352
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:16,957
I used to wonder why do they repeat?

353
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:20,106
And they didn’t get it in their heads or
what?

354
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:25,096
Now the thing is, that is what is the background
of this brain and don’t spoil it more by

355
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,526
this sun.

356
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:37,496
You have to do work of this Sahasrara, Sahasrara
which is the lotus, lotus of the Divine which

357
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:42,667
has got beautiful petals now enlightened by
your Kundalini.

358
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:47,917
They are the living petals, do not try to
play with it.

359
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:53,447
That’s why I say, don’t read funny books,
don’t see funny things, don’t talk to

360
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:59,677
funny people, don’t waste your energy in
worrying, in futuristic attitude, keep to

361
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:00,677
yourself.

362
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:07,667
Let this [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER
HEAD] grow because the roots are in the brain.

363
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:16,167
The tree of awareness grows downward but the
roots are in the brain and you have to go

364
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:22,427
to the roots now because you have done that
movement now you come back and for that you

365
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:25,447
have to know to look after your brain.

366
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:35,367
The other day I also said that I don’t know
why you people don’t put any oil whatsoever.

367
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:41,276
Why not put oil in the head, poor head needs
the oil always, at least on a Saturday, put

368
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:45,656
so much oil, rub it nicely and have a bath.

369
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,366
But people just don’t put any oil in their
head.

370
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:53,616
I mean you must oil, gear up your brain, don’t
you think so?

371
00:35:53,616 --> 00:36:00,587
If you don’t put oil in any machine, it
will crack.

372
00:36:00,587 --> 00:36:07,136
For this brain which is your special machine
after Sahaja Yoga is really a very special

373
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:14,937
one, you must try to put lot of oil in it.

374
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:20,516
Put some oil in the ears, put some oil in
the nose.

375
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:26,786
Now the modern theory of the doctors is don’t
put any oil or anything into the ears and

376
00:36:26,786 --> 00:36:29,846
the noses of the children.

377
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:36,476
Rajesh’s brother had a child and they went
to of course to a latest Doctor from America.

378
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:44,677
And the child was crying, weeping, feeling
so horrible and his Brahmarandra, what you

379
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:48,947
call, the fontanel bone area was not filled
at all, it was all open.

380
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:51,187
I said, “What’s the matter with you people?”

381
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:53,896
They said the doctor has said, “Don’t
touch the oil.”

382
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:54,896
I said, “What?”

383
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,807
They said, “He’ll have allergy”.

384
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:01,577
I said, “Nothing of the kind, you bring
the oil.”

385
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:06,726
I got one full katori [KATORI MEANS BOWL IN
HINDI] of oil, rubbed it on his head, pushed

386
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:11,406
back that thing and I put it in nose, in ears,
the child slept like a log of wood.

387
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:15,776
Imagine how much the child must have suffered?

388
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:18,036
These stupid ideas come from where?

389
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:23,557
I don’t know, they don’t have any oil
these days, so what is their idea is to do,

390
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:26,626
some business must be behind it, I don’t
know what is going on.

391
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:30,677
I don’t know what they are going to run
by not giving any oil to the children.

392
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:35,457
They must be having some business with that
also.

393
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:37,937
Otherwise it is absolutely a stupid idea.

394
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:41,156
I just don’t understand that the child has
an allergy.

395
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:46,947
But how presumptuous to think like that!

396
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:50,776
Now why the child has an allergy.

397
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:52,937
Now let Me ask a question.

398
00:37:52,937 --> 00:38:01,236
Why a child will have an allergy?

399
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:09,966
The doctors have to answer.

400
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:19,947
Or, of course you are all doctors so you should
say.

401
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:20,947
Can I have the answer?

402
00:38:20,947 --> 00:38:21,947
Yogi: It could be an imbalance of heat and
cold in the body?

403
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:22,947
Shri Mataji: But why?

404
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:23,947
Say on the chakras.

405
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:39,417
You say on the chakras what will be catching.

406
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,496
If somebody has allergies, what does it catch?

407
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:44,417
Yogi: The Left Nabhi.

408
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,866
Shri Mataji: Correct.

409
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:46,866
Left Nabhi.

410
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,427
Left Nabhi will catch.

411
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:54,626
Now that means the mother.

412
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,297
Because the child is not yet married so it’s
the mother.

413
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:05,817
That means mother must be having a left Nabhi
herself and that’s why the child must catching

414
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:12,706
with that allergy, so instead of punishing
the child, why not cure the left Nabhi of

415
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:17,226
the mother and left Nabhi of the child?

416
00:39:17,226 --> 00:39:21,236
Now what will you do if there’s a left Nabhi
of the child?

417
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:46,786
What we can do to help the child to get rid
of it?

418
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:52,536
Ah, very simple.

419
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:57,307
Anything that is left can be taken out on
the little flame.

420
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:03,917
Put your right hand on the left Nabhi of the
child and put your left hand to the flame

421
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:08,067
and finished.

422
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:14,557
Now in diagnosis you are easy but now for
medicines, now remember the certain principles

423
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:16,697
of medicines.

424
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:19,687
Very certain principles are there.

425
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:27,606
If it is left side, you have take it to the
fire or to the sun or to the flames, all right?

426
00:40:27,606 --> 00:40:32,156
If it is a left side [could Shri Mataji have
meant “right”?] you have take it to the

427
00:40:32,156 --> 00:40:33,156
water in general.

428
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:42,947
Any body suffering from right side, put him
in the water, finished.

429
00:40:42,947 --> 00:40:44,007
Done.

430
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:46,067
Not in the sun of course.

431
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:57,116
Any disease, you bring it to this point.

432
00:40:57,116 --> 00:41:01,266
It’s very simple.

433
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,937
Now let Me have some questions about certain
diseases.

434
00:41:02,937 --> 00:41:06,187
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks.

435
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:09,136
Shri Mataji: Huh?

436
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:22,227
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks, so they must have it.

437
00:41:22,227 --> 00:41:26,367
Shri Mataji: All right let’s have it, I
will see if I can answer.

438
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:27,367
Yes.

439
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,607
Yogi: Psoriasis, Mother?

440
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:32,027
Shri Mataji: Huh?

441
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:33,647
Yogi: Psoriasis.

442
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:36,887
Shri Mataji: Same thing.

443
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:40,527
Psoriasis is nothing else but left side problem.

444
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:43,047
Is a lethargic liver.

445
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:47,157
And gives you allergies.

446
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:55,977
For psoriasis, left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

447
00:41:55,977 --> 00:42:03,027
Putting hot water bottle on the stomach.

448
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:21,747
Or even giving bandhan to your liver with
the light is all right.

449
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,957
You must see, because psoriasis, now people
might think psoriasis means active liver or

450
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:29,527
inactive liver, you see it comes to that point.

451
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:32,257
But we have only two types: active or inactive.

452
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:36,167
Now whether psoriasis is inactive or active
you will know from one point that when the

453
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:43,697
liver is inactive you get the allergies, and
when it is active you get other problems like

454
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:55,887
what you call that in English, I don’t know,
nausea and also you get biliousness.

455
00:42:55,887 --> 00:43:01,707
You don’t eat much, you thin down all these
problems are there.

456
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:02,847
Now what else?

457
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,547
Yogi: Eczema?

458
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:09,647
Shri Mataji: For eczema same thing.

459
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:18,747
Eczema is the same thing, is just like allergy,
eczema same thing.

460
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:23,147
But for eczema because it’s outward you
can use certain things like neem ka pata and

461
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:26,557
all that I’ve told you and so many things
can be used on top.

462
00:43:26,557 --> 00:43:29,147
Yogi: Fungus?

463
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:36,907
Shri Mataji: Fungus, outside or inside?

464
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,597
Yogi: On the skin.

465
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:41,857
Shri Mataji: Is one of the worst thing is
fungus.

466
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:47,437
Same thing, but it’s the worst thing I should
say that it’s the left side again is the

467
00:43:47,437 --> 00:43:52,557
attack is the left side fungus is all dead
and you have to use the left side towards

468
00:43:52,557 --> 00:43:56,217
the photograph and right hand on the places
wherever you have the fungus, you may take

469
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:02,577
it out that way but don’t eat cheese, and
the fungousy cheese you are not supposed to

470
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:03,887
eat at all.

471
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:07,587
All the Sahaja Yogis should not eat any fungousy
cheese.

472
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:17,607
That blue one, with a crust one, all fungus
must to avoided, and also mushrooms if possible.

473
00:44:17,607 --> 00:44:27,007
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

474
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,777
Shri Mataji: What is…?

475
00:44:30,777 --> 00:44:40,177
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

476
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,947
Shri Mataji: Cow’s milk..

477
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:47,137
Yogi: Because it’s left side?

478
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,647
Shri Mataji: Left side.

479
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:53,777
Cow’s milk always give you the left side
because she’s the mother, and you should

480
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:58,767
not have her milk, because it’s left sided.

481
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:03,828
Whether it is cow’s milk or buffalo’s
milk, all will give allergies but if you have

482
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:12,357
animals which are smaller than you like if
you can drink like Mahatma Gandhi the goat’s

483
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:31,437
milk then you might not have the problem.

484
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,487
Yogi: We do completely around..

485
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:33,957
When we have diarrhea we drink milk.

486
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:35,227
Shri Mataji: Diarrhea you drink milk?

487
00:45:35,227 --> 00:45:39,977
The amount of salads you eat, sometimes I
think this fodder will make us like buffalos

488
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:41,977
or what?

489
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:49,957
I just can’t touch them I tell you.

490
00:45:49,957 --> 00:46:00,937
But I have to eat just to show that I appreciate.

491
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:02,337
Yogi: Bronchial Asthma.

492
00:46:02,337 --> 00:46:06,057
Shri Mataji: Bronchial asthma is caused by
the combination of the right heart and the

493
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,217
left heart.

494
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:17,107
If the parents have been quarreling too much,
if they are divorced, if you never had the

495
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:23,417
security of the parent’s love, then you
get bronchial asthma, but if it is another

496
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:30,637
one just superficial one then it could be
from the father’s death or from the fatherhood

497
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:36,817
suffering but if father and motherhood both
have made you insecure or if both of them

498
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:42,197
have died then you get bronchial asthma.

499
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:44,097
Is a combination.

500
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,947
Yogi: Hypoglycemia.

501
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:49,657
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

502
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:53,367
Yogi: Low blood level.

503
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:54,367
Hypo-glycemia.

504
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:57,997
Shri Mataji: I know.

505
00:46:57,997 --> 00:47:00,787
Low blood level.

506
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:04,787
That comes from over activity.

507
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:08,297
You should not think so much.

508
00:47:08,297 --> 00:47:09,297
Agnya.

509
00:47:09,297 --> 00:47:11,727
Too much of Agyna.

510
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:13,097
Agnya chakra.

511
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,837
Too much of agnya.

512
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:24,557
Surrender yourself to Christ, absolutely surrender
yourself to Christ, it will work out.

513
00:47:24,557 --> 00:47:26,097
Yogi: Spondylitis.

514
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:30,687
Shri Mataji: Spondylitis is left Vishuddhi.

515
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:35,287
And right Vishuddhi could be also.

516
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:38,497
But mostly left Vishuddhi Spondylitis.

517
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:40,767
Combination also could be.

518
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:44,307
Yogi: Multiple Sclerosis.

519
00:47:44,307 --> 00:47:53,727
Shri Mataji: Multiple Sclerosis is comes from
Mooladhara.

520
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:57,257
Mooladhara and Nabhi.

521
00:47:57,257 --> 00:48:01,967
Left Nabhi and Mooladhara.

522
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,687
It’s more left sided.

523
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:08,637
Give the treatment of the left side.

524
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:12,717
Saying the name of Ganesha and of Gauri.

525
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:15,577
It will work out.

526
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:18,437
Yogi: Varicose veins Mother.

527
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,577
Shri Mataji: Huh?

528
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,717
Yogi: Varicose veins.

529
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:30,337
Shri Mataji: It comes from the people who
stand too much all the time and they work

530
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:31,507
very hard.

531
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:38,627
As soon as it starts it’s better to cure
them, you have to lie down everyday.

532
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:45,317
Those who stand everyday for more than say
three-four hours should lie down on bed and

533
00:48:45,317 --> 00:48:46,317
do cycling.

534
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:49,527
[SHRI MATAJI MAKES CYCLING MOVEMENTS WITH
HER HANDS].

535
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:53,307
Everyday, that will help reduce the weight
maybe due to weight also.

536
00:48:53,307 --> 00:49:02,737
Some people have weight, but those who stand,
I’ve seen those who stand for a long time

537
00:49:02,737 --> 00:49:08,957
without the heels, if you use the heels you
might be better off.

538
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:15,627
With the heels the pressure is not so much
then it is distributed more to the lower of

539
00:49:15,627 --> 00:49:19,207
those five chakras down below that might help.

540
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:25,257
But, best is to do exercise after you have
stood for a long time just lie down in the

541
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:32,357
bed and do cycling, and also massaging, slowly
massaging it downward.

542
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:42,707
Also it can work out with the ice treatment,
you can put some ice before massaging you

543
00:49:42,707 --> 00:49:54,677
can put the ice on them and use very cold
oil and rub it, it will work out.

544
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:55,787
Yogi: Flu?

545
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:56,787
Flu?

546
00:49:56,787 --> 00:50:00,257
Shri Mataji: That’s one thing is difficult.

547
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:01,467
Flu.

548
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:08,707
Now for flu, first of all this is again left-sided.

549
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:14,527
But we have got a very good medicine in India
I don’t know if you have that there is what

550
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:19,057
you call is the basil [IN HINDI IT IS CALLED
TULSI].

551
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:24,307
Basil leaves, you take lots of basil leaves
make a concoction, it’s called?

552
00:50:24,307 --> 00:50:25,307
Yogi: Infusion.

553
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,427
Shri Mataji: Huh?

554
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:27,427
Yogi: Infusion.

555
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:28,557
Shri Mataji: No.

556
00:50:28,557 --> 00:50:31,527
Yogi: Boil it up in a pot.

557
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:37,207
Shri Mataji: Boil it up in a pot, make it
absolutely, the essence take it out quite

558
00:50:37,207 --> 00:50:42,177
thick put tea in it or wateror just like the
way you want to make it like a tea and put

559
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:49,127
milk or whichever way you want but less milk
and sugar because the taste may not be so

560
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:50,127
good.

561
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:55,137
And then you drink it, before that you have
to prepare some what you call for dhuni?

562
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:59,827
You all know ajwain ka dhuni.

563
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:03,807
You see you know that.

564
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:13,997
So you take ajwain ka dhuni after that, that’s
all.

565
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:25,197
You do it three days you’ll be all right,
cleared out.

566
00:51:25,197 --> 00:51:30,287
Yogi: Shri Mataji, psychosomatic diseases…?

567
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,347
Shri Mataji: What?

568
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:45,567
Yogi: He’s saying psychosomatic diseases
in particular, nervous break down comes from

569
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,587
where?

570
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:48,457
Right side or left side?

571
00:51:48,457 --> 00:51:51,567
Shri Mataji: You see it’s a very funny word
psychosomatic means it’s also psycho and

572
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,057
it’s also somatic, so I don’t know which
one it is, if you say psycho somatic or somatic

573
00:51:55,057 --> 00:51:56,057
psycho.

574
00:51:56,057 --> 00:51:57,057
Yogi: You mean psychological diseases?

575
00:51:57,057 --> 00:51:58,057
Shri Mataji: Nehi, nehi.

576
00:51:58,057 --> 00:51:59,057
Psychosomatic is nervousness you see.

577
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:02,347
Nervousness can be caused by bad habits.

578
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:04,607
How?

579
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:10,597
Like if you are an air hostess you form a
bad habit, as soon as you see the airport

580
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:13,937
[SHRI MATAJI MOVES HER HAND AROUND HER STOMACH
INDICATING NERVOUSNESS].

581
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:15,937
Now those who travel too much.

582
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:19,767
As soon as they have to travel they go off
their heads.

583
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:25,778
Over doing anything, you see, you get nervous
feeling, it’s a matter of habit, you form

584
00:52:25,778 --> 00:52:28,037
that habit so it happens.

585
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:34,307
So, I will not say it is due to some bhadha
or anything, but your nerves are too much

586
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:36,177
used in a particular way.

587
00:52:36,177 --> 00:52:39,557
Then they just give in, they cannot work it
out anymore.

588
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:42,357
So then you must change that habit.

589
00:52:42,357 --> 00:52:49,937
Supposing you are traveling too much by plane,
then travel by a ship, or travel by a train,

590
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:53,927
or by a bullock cart.

591
00:52:53,927 --> 00:53:02,437
Or don’t travel, something like that, anything
that you over do too much that forms a kind

592
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:04,517
of a strain on your nerves.

593
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:09,487
So try to reduce that strain on your nerves.

594
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:16,297
Yogi: You recommended heels, what height?

595
00:53:16,297 --> 00:53:27,307
Shri Mataji: No, no I didn’t say for all
of you.

596
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:29,887
I said for varicose veins.

597
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,087
Or specially for people who develop problems
on the heels.

598
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:39,757
There’s no height you just try whatever
you can say about one inch will do from one

599
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:47,497
inch onward, anything, not too much one inch
or lower, but you see if you develop some

600
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:56,377
sort of a bone on your heels or something
like that for that the heels are always better.

601
00:53:56,377 --> 00:53:59,967
Little heels are better.

602
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:00,967
Baldness.

603
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:04,447
It’s not a disease.

604
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:10,727
But it comes out of many habits.

605
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:13,497
One of them is wearing the hat.

606
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:20,637
If you wear the hat too tight then the circulation
of the brain is spoiled and that’s when

607
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:22,287
you might get one.

608
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:30,127
Then also with the left Nabhi you might develop
a back bald head here if you have a left Nabhi

609
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:35,597
then their’s no circulation, it works out
that way.

610
00:54:35,597 --> 00:54:46,037
And they say that if somebody has a bald head
he will get some money, he’s a moneyed man,

611
00:54:46,037 --> 00:54:47,037
in India.

612
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:56,867
I don’t know why we believe in such a thing,
but we believe that if you have a bald head

613
00:54:56,867 --> 00:55:01,607
means he’s a moneyed man, you see, the one
who does not have a bald head is not a moneyed

614
00:55:01,607 --> 00:55:08,547
man, who doesn’t have a belly is not a dignified
man, according to Indian standards.

615
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:12,137
But bald head is caused by not using oil.

616
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:16,377
Or, by not using proper oil.

617
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:26,017
Oil should be used properly and the skull
must be actually the skull must be rubbed

618
00:55:26,017 --> 00:55:33,437
not the skin so that if you rub it the skin
must move on the skull and then you won’t

619
00:55:33,437 --> 00:55:34,587
have this problem.

620
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:41,437
Another is that if you use funny type of oils
with lots of fragrance and essences in it

621
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,467
then you might get grey hair.

622
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:51,107
And also ghee should never be used for rubbing
in the head but you can use it for the body

623
00:55:51,107 --> 00:56:00,488
is good ghee or even the butter is good if
you are overactive, then, otherwise not, but

624
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:07,337
ghee should never be used or butter should
never be used for the hair.

625
00:56:07,337 --> 00:56:10,817
Now you have two types of bald heads, as I
told you.

626
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:13,417
Some who start from here and some who start
from there.

627
00:56:13,417 --> 00:56:14,907
[SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF HER HEAD
AND THEN TO THE BACK].

628
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:17,467
It’s a very interesting subject.

629
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:18,997
[YOGIS LAUGH TOO].

630
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:22,767
And, those who have both, could be.

631
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:30,717
Now I would say the one which starts from
here [SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF THE

632
00:56:30,717 --> 00:56:38,497
HEAD] are the people who are the ones who
have got an Ekadesha problem also possibly.

633
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:44,037
With the Ekadesha problem it starts or who
are not very collective or something, it will

634
00:56:44,037 --> 00:56:45,257
start receding back.

635
00:56:45,257 --> 00:56:52,757
All right, those who start from here [SHRI
MATAJI POINTS TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD] are

636
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:59,657
the people who may not be good husbands, maybe
something wrong with their wives, maybe bad

637
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:06,007
wives, the husband-wife relationship is upsetting
then also this starts at the back or maybe

638
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:12,617
there’s some incompatibility between the
two or too much attachment to the wife or

639
00:57:12,617 --> 00:57:17,097
too much attachment to the husband also you
start developing like that.

640
00:57:17,097 --> 00:57:22,347
All these things are left Nabhi, so the left
Nabhi relationship you know is the Gruha Lakshmi

641
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:28,207
relationship, where you adore your wife so
much that she’s no more a Gruha Lakshmi

642
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:32,537
also is a wrong thing, these things start
with that.

643
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:38,407
And also could be, also could be with your
hectic life, if you are very hectic in your

644
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:43,587
life running up and down doing too much work
also it may start, you don’t listen to your

645
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:48,177
wife about it and you think you have to do
this work then also it might start it there

646
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,927
are so many reasons for the left Nabhi to
start, but the one that starts here [SHRI

647
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,787
MATAJI POINTS TO HER FOREHEAD AREA] starts
with the right Nabhi or we can say with the

648
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,287
Ekadesha more on this side.

649
00:57:57,287 --> 00:58:01,877
So I don’t know in your case, Johan, what
should I blame.

650
00:58:01,877 --> 00:58:09,727
I would say is a complete neglect, complete
neglect of your hair, no oiling at all that’s

651
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:16,377
what it is, I mean if you do not give water
to the plant it will die and then if you say

652
00:58:16,377 --> 00:58:19,647
why is it caused, I mean if you don’t give
it water it’s the one that it eats, drinks

653
00:58:19,647 --> 00:58:22,497
and lives on so oil is the one on which the
hair reside.

654
00:58:22,497 --> 00:58:31,537
Yogi: In the west we get pain in the knees
when we sit on the ground, is there anyway

655
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:42,197
of avoiding it?

656
00:58:42,197 --> 00:58:50,787
Shri Mataji: You see it is due to the Nabhi
you have.

657
00:58:50,787 --> 00:58:55,857
Right or the left and no practice of sitting
down.

658
00:58:55,857 --> 00:59:03,107
Now what you have to do that you have to learn
a certain what you call an exercise.

659
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:07,427
I’ve told people what is the exercise needed
for it then you’ll get used to it you’ll

660
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:11,017
start sitting on the ground all right without
feeling the pain on the knees.

661
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:15,347
It will help you in the long run very much.

662
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:18,397
There are certain exercises to be done.

663
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:23,897
But at least your children you make them sit
on the ground from now so that there’s no

664
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:24,897
problem for them.

665
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:32,697
Yogi: I noticed that a lot of ladies…

666
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:38,687
Shri Mataji: Here?

667
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:40,717
In the West?

668
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:50,417
Yogi: When I came to Paris, I noticed a lot
of ladies after sixty years old began to lose

669
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:51,417
hair.

670
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:55,107
Shri Mataji: But sixty years one should have
that otherwise they don’t look all right,

671
00:59:55,107 --> 01:00:00,887
you see, in sixty years you should look like
a sixty year old, you see, otherwise it’s

672
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:01,887
very embarrassing.

673
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:06,597
For Me I must say I must also get some bald
head and some wrinkles and this and that.

674
01:00:06,597 --> 01:00:11,317
Because, you see, once we were traveling and
we had some lady with us she’s six years

675
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:15,967
younger to Me and Modi was all the time trying
to help her, poor old lady, poor old lady,

676
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:21,187
I said what’s this nonsense, she’s six
years, younger to Me and you are just trying

677
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:23,097
to help her all the time.

678
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:24,837
What about Me?

679
01:00:24,837 --> 01:00:30,777
Nobody’s bothered, they make Me sit for
hours together, they do this, do that.

680
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:40,477
Supposing if I looked old, you would have
said, “No, no Mother, you must be tired.”

681
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:45,707
Now the ladies develop that because they might
be dominating women – possibly, or maybe

682
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:48,677
they are neglecting their hair.

683
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:50,447
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

684
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,227
Shri Mataji: Huh?

685
01:00:52,227 --> 01:00:54,007
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

686
01:00:54,007 --> 01:01:01,487
Shri Mataji: Drunkenness, also could be they
might have taken drugs or maybe, in the west

687
01:01:01,487 --> 01:01:10,697
anything is possible under the sun, you see,
or maybe, they’ve had some problems with

688
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:16,867
their mothers or something like that basically
must be there but I think mostly it is due

689
01:01:16,867 --> 01:01:19,647
to neglect, complete neglect of the hair.

690
01:01:19,647 --> 01:01:28,437
You see these hair styles, now you go to any
person who is doing this hair styling within

691
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:34,277
three years time we are bald, then they will
give a wig, that’s their business.

692
01:01:34,277 --> 01:01:37,347
So going to these hair dressers and all that
you develop it.

693
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:40,657
What is the need to go to the hair dresser?

694
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:41,857
I don’t understand.

695
01:01:41,857 --> 01:01:45,477
There’s no need, waste your time, waste
your money.

696
01:01:45,477 --> 01:01:46,987
You look very nice without it.

697
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:50,987
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

698
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:52,187
Shri Mataji: Huh?

699
01:01:52,187 --> 01:01:53,187
What she…?

700
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:56,987
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

701
01:01:56,987 --> 01:02:01,777
Shri Mataji: Ah, you might.

702
01:02:01,777 --> 01:02:05,317
Try.

703
01:02:05,317 --> 01:02:14,487
If not by Sahaja Yoga, they say there is a
method.

704
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:16,157
They put something here there [SHRI MATAJI
POINTS TO THE TOP OF HER HEAD] and they plant

705
01:02:16,157 --> 01:02:17,307
it and all those things they do.

706
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:19,887
If you do it then I’ll see to it that they
grow well.

707
01:02:19,887 --> 01:02:22,767
Yogi: Why are diseases through generations
limited to seven generations?

708
01:02:22,767 --> 01:02:33,697
Or any trouble, Mother, that comes through
the generations?

709
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:55,367
Shri Mataji: The problems are like this.

710
01:02:55,367 --> 01:03:04,767
There’s only one center which covers all
the seven centers which is the Mooladhara.

711
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:08,287
Because it is the Omkara.

712
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:13,957
It is the Chaitanya.

713
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:19,887
If Mooladhara is insulted, say I said that
if there’s an incest relationship and the

714
01:03:19,887 --> 01:03:24,457
family grows then it is seven generations.

715
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:31,247
But, if it is between a very holy relationship
like a mother and a son or something like

716
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:38,907
that then it is fourteen generations.

717
01:03:38,907 --> 01:03:49,207
It’s complete insult of Shri Ganesh and
so many of these can come from there most

718
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:52,807
of it comes because Shri Ganesha gives you
the real strength.

719
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:54,697
Those who have insulted Shri Ganesha are always
delicate people physically, so you have to

720
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,267
reestablish your Shri Ganesh.

721
01:03:56,267 --> 01:03:59,107
Yogi: …How to keep the body cool in summer?.

722
01:03:59,107 --> 01:04:00,107
Shri Mataji: Uh?

723
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:11,297
Yogi: How to keep the body cool in summer?

724
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:20,577
Shri Mataji: To keep the body cool in summer
first of all you have to do is to take some

725
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:28,517
ice and rub it on your liver, keep the liver
cool, don’t think too much, don’t take

726
01:04:28,517 --> 01:04:35,497
hot things like in the summer time so many
people eat those watermelons and things like

727
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:36,497
that.

728
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:41,547
They should be cooled down properly, like
even mangos in India must be cooled down and

729
01:04:41,547 --> 01:04:42,777
then taken.

730
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:47,507
All such fruits should be cooled down and
then eaten.

731
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:51,367
Some people eat the mangos just from the tree,
that’s very wrong.

732
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:55,257
You have to cool it down for twenty-four hours
and then eat it.

733
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:59,147
This we knew all of us, but in modern times
I don’t know if people don’t know.

734
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:00,947
All these things add up.

735
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:07,267
Then reduce on meats and fish specially, you
should not eat fish in the summertime at all.

736
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:13,577
First of all it is spoiled, something wrong
with it or else it has phosphorous which ignites

737
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,577
you.

738
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,017
So avoid all these things, eat things which
are cool.

739
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:22,687
Now specially for India it is very easy because
we have got something called gool khand which

740
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:28,397
is made out of rose petals which is a very
good thing for cooling the liver, then cardamom,

741
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:31,987
then the candy sugar, sugar itself.

742
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:38,437
All these things will cool down your liver
and you’ll feel very good.

743
01:05:38,437 --> 01:05:46,877
It’s the change in your diet is very important
during the summertime.

744
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:57,527
Yogi: Hemorrhoids, is it a Mooladhara problem?

745
01:05:57,527 --> 01:05:59,047
Hemorrhoids?

746
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:05,137
Shri Mataji: Right side.

747
01:06:05,137 --> 01:06:09,697
Right side Mooladhara.

748
01:06:09,697 --> 01:06:12,747
Right side.

749
01:06:12,747 --> 01:06:18,557
For that you have to keep yourself cool, again
get the cooling effects, all the cooling things

750
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:24,297
to be done and also a very good thing is to
eat the black dried grapes.

751
01:06:24,297 --> 01:06:28,307
What do you call them?

752
01:06:28,307 --> 01:06:29,917
Yogi: Raisins.

753
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:32,327
Shri Mataji: Raisins.

754
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:37,627
Black raisins, soak them in the night with
some orange juice and eat them, I mean soak

755
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:44,107
them in the morning eat them in the night
before sleeping.

756
01:06:44,107 --> 01:07:01,217
That

757
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:18,977
will cool down, that’s very, very cooling
[HINDI] I’ve forgotten the name.

758
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:33,927
[MARATHI] For allergy the best is gheru, you
take all of you, you should take gheru those

759
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:42,417
who suffer from allergy and we get little
stone pieces round ones rub it on that and

760
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:51,547
take it with some water about seven times
and then eat it, is good for allergies, but

761
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:56,047
everybody should not only those who have allergies,
gheru is not good for people who have overactive

762
01:07:56,047 --> 01:07:57,047
liver.

763
01:07:57,047 --> 01:07:58,047
Now if you’re finished, huh..

764
01:07:58,047 --> 01:07:59,047
Shri Mataji: Kya?

765
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:00,047
[IT MEANS “WHAT?”

766
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,047
IN HINDI]

767
01:08:01,047 --> 01:08:20,007
Yogi: India has the biggest problem of leprosy
particularly Bihar and U.P., what is the reason?

768
01:08:20,007 --> 01:08:23,977
Shri Mataji: It’s a kind of a, you know
it’s an infectious disease and now they

769
01:08:23,977 --> 01:08:31,717
have found some sort of a thing for that leprosy,
is not only in India it was everywhere, but

770
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:41,267
you know the [HINDI] the ones what you call
them the parasites which create this leprosy

771
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:56,027
drink kerosene oil, petrol, they prosper in
petrol, do you know that?

772
01:08:56,027 --> 01:09:09,427
Yogi: What is the treatment in Sahaja for
that?

773
01:09:09,427 --> 01:09:14,377
Shri Mataji: For leprosy, you see, for any
infection as such it’s all left-sided.

774
01:09:14,377 --> 01:09:18,087
One can work it out but as far as possible
keep out of it.

775
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,087
Infectious diseases you better not treat.

776
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:25,927
This is very dangerous, I will never advise
you because you shouldn’t waste your energy

777
01:09:25,927 --> 01:09:28,937
on lepers now, leave them to Me.

778
01:09:28,937 --> 01:09:34,837
Which is the easiest way to cure yourself?

779
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:42,417
Yogi: What about people who are born with
epilepsy?

780
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:47,707
Shri Mataji: Oh, epilepsy is curable, hundred
percent curable, it’s a left-sided problem,

781
01:09:47,707 --> 01:09:52,957
epilepsy whether born or anything can be cured,
can be cured.

782
01:09:52,957 --> 01:09:55,997
Yogi: [SAYS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE]

783
01:09:55,997 --> 01:09:56,997
Huh?

784
01:09:56,997 --> 01:09:57,997
Excessive?

785
01:09:57,997 --> 01:10:00,537
Yogi: Excessive tooth decay?

786
01:10:00,537 --> 01:10:03,577
Shri Mataji: Tooth decay?

787
01:10:03,577 --> 01:10:14,728
You see for tooth decay the thing is you must
use your fingers to rub on your teeth you

788
01:10:14,728 --> 01:10:18,357
see that’s the thing and also on your gums.

789
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:22,147
So what you have because you have got vibrations,
your right Vishuddhi’s quite all right,

790
01:10:22,147 --> 01:10:27,877
it is due to right Vishuddhi, so what you
have to do is deficiency in Right Vishuddhi

791
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:34,227
gives you, rub it nicely with olive oil and
little salt, very good finely thinned out

792
01:10:34,227 --> 01:10:45,907
salt and it will stop it everyday, everyday,
brushing is not sufficient.

793
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,889
Shri Mataji: One more, one more.

794
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:49,889
One more here.

795
01:10:49,889 --> 01:10:50,889
What’s it?

796
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:51,889
Sit down, sit down.

797
01:10:51,889 --> 01:11:04,907
Yogi: What is the reason for having your intestines
all on the left side?

798
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:07,947
Shri Mataji: All on the left side?

799
01:11:07,947 --> 01:11:11,607
Nothing on the right.

800
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,437
Good idea.

801
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:15,267
Left side.

802
01:11:15,267 --> 01:11:26,627
There’s no reason as such you see after
all think that God creates so many human beings.

803
01:11:26,627 --> 01:11:33,257
Even I mean you tell about two hundred people
to do some work, one goes this way, another

804
01:11:33,257 --> 01:11:39,347
goes that way, you don’t know what happens,
they go so helter-skelter.

805
01:11:39,347 --> 01:11:53,547
Now in that sometimes it’s a freak it happens,
there are freaks, it makes no difference.

806
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:57,327
All right, what do you want?

807
01:11:57,327 --> 01:11:59,727
What’d she say?

808
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:02,127
Yogi: Ulcerative colitis.

809
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:12,177
Shri Mataji: Ulcerative colitis comes by people
who have amebiosis maybe one of them could

810
01:12:12,177 --> 01:12:14,827
be, is it there?

811
01:12:14,827 --> 01:12:15,827
Hmm.

812
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:18,137
Yogi: Is there amebiosis?

813
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:20,786
Shri Mataji: Yeah, yes.

814
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:21,786
Could be due to that.

815
01:12:21,786 --> 01:12:28,547
Or could be due to very hot food if you eat,
or if you drink too much and all these things

816
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:34,587
you see can be affecting, but mostly it is
due to amebiosis I’ve seen it and hot food,

817
01:12:34,587 --> 01:12:48,167
you shouldn’t eat hot food, like some people
like very hot food and they get this trouble.

818
01:12:48,167 --> 01:13:04,677
Yogi: Does anyone have a question that’s
a little more visionary?

819
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:06,937
A little less medical.

820
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:12,217
What about Hailey’s Comet appearing later
this year?

821
01:13:12,217 --> 01:13:15,507
Shri Mataji: I’ve seen it.

822
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:23,677
This Mr. Hailey had seen it and he said this
will happen, that will happen and they say

823
01:13:23,677 --> 01:13:35,937
so it’s a good sign, let’s see, you see
whatever maybe the stars, whatever may be

824
01:13:35,937 --> 01:13:45,017
the things, unless and until human beings
become sensitive nothing can happen.

825
01:13:45,017 --> 01:13:50,637
We have to be sensitive people to receive
the blessings of these things otherwise Hailey

826
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:55,077
may come, Mailey may come but we go on forever
to be.

827
01:13:55,077 --> 01:14:02,267
If we are become sensitive then only it will
happen, first of all when there is ego what’s

828
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:04,947
it’s nothing is going to work out.

829
01:14:04,947 --> 01:14:13,167
Ego has to go down and you have to feel everything,
the vibrations and everything of the atmosphere

830
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:25,647
of all the stars, then it will work out.

831
01:14:25,647 --> 01:14:33,457
Otherwise, it has no effect.

832
01:14:33,457 --> 01:14:44,797
Yogi: What is the proper attitude when we
take darshan from You?

833
01:14:44,797 --> 01:14:51,637
I’ve never known how to approach You.

834
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:57,507
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s rather embarrassing.

835
01:14:57,507 --> 01:15:11,197
All right I’ll close My eyes and My face
and I’ll tell you [MARATHI].

836
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:12,197
Now.

837
01:15:12,197 --> 01:15:16,087
Your question is nice.

838
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:32,197
Now supposing Christ appears before you and
you know He’s Christ, what will happen?

839
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:46,727
That should be the attitude at least minimum,
though Christ had to manage only one chakra

840
01:15:46,727 --> 01:15:53,296
I have to manage seven.

841
01:15:53,296 --> 01:16:01,387
If that attitude develops even thinking of
Me is sufficient, you have to just think of

842
01:16:01,387 --> 01:16:07,597
Me your diseases will be cured.

843
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,347
That depth has to be there.

844
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:14,577
This is just one chakra seven times raised
to the power seven.

845
01:16:14,577 --> 01:16:18,407
That’s what it is.

846
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:25,827
You have seen the miracles, you have seen
the photographs, you have seen thousands getting

847
01:16:25,827 --> 01:16:28,187
Realization, none of them did it.

848
01:16:28,187 --> 01:16:33,647
But also I’m Mahamaya.

849
01:16:33,647 --> 01:16:42,067
But in your heart you should know whom you
are facing.

850
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:59,316
But mostly people get into the web of Mahamaya
very much that awe is so fulfilling, so penetrating,

851
01:16:59,316 --> 01:17:09,127
so deep that one lives with that idea only
all the time, you don’t need anything with

852
01:17:09,127 --> 01:17:10,127
that.

853
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:16,997
It’s a very great fortune, if I were you
I would have called Myself the most fortunate

854
01:17:16,997 --> 01:17:24,737
person, but it’s the other way round, I
don’t know what to say then, though I must

855
01:17:24,737 --> 01:17:29,627
say that I’m very fortunate because compared
to all of them I have so many of you here

856
01:17:29,627 --> 01:17:37,477
who are Sahaja Yogis, so I’m very fortunate,
very happy about it, very happy, but still

857
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:41,127
to grow in that you have to know what it is.

858
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:52,097
Indians have senses, it goes easily into their
heads, they are very sensitive.

859
01:17:52,097 --> 01:18:38,617
In the same way I hope you develop it in that
way, in that fashion, then life would be very

860
01:18:38,617 --> 01:18:41,147
enjoyable.

861
01:18:41,147 --> 01:19:01,377
All right now coming back to something practical.

862
01:19:01,377 --> 01:19:13,618
I have to ask you have you made all the purchases
that are needed for your pujas in your various

863
01:19:13,618 --> 01:19:14,618
countries?

864
01:19:14,618 --> 01:19:20,807
Yogi: They are going to do some of it in Bombay,
on the day it’s available.

865
01:19:20,807 --> 01:19:25,137
When the busses go back in each case.

866
01:19:25,137 --> 01:19:32,747
Shri Mataji: Because all those who are going
Europeans, please raise your hands.

867
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:33,747
By the earlier.

868
01:19:33,747 --> 01:19:34,747
Yogi: First bus.

869
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:35,747
Shri Mataji: First bus.

870
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:38,287
Yogi: Monday 7:15 the Egypt Airfly will leave
on the 17th morning.

871
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:44,377
Shri Mataji: Now there’s one good solution
also, I was saying that if you start very

872
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:48,377
early in the morning, next day you may reach
there for this work but the shops close very

873
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:49,377
fast.

874
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:55,137
Another one could be you make a list of things
that you want and send it over to Nima or

875
01:19:55,137 --> 01:20:04,207
someone, and they’ll keep it ready for you
so you need not go to the shop to get it.

876
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:10,347
For example, if you want to buy a mukhoot,
you want to buy this and that, better give

877
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:14,577
her a list and they will keep it ready for
you.

878
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:23,307
As soon as you go you’ll get them, is a
better idea, don’t leave it to chances because

879
01:20:23,307 --> 01:20:29,607
when you travel you see you don’t know the
car may not take you at the right time, the

880
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:39,987
shops maybe closed, being Sunday it’s going
to be difficult again, best is to make a list,

881
01:20:39,987 --> 01:20:44,887
even Saturday is very difficult there, it’s
so crowded and all that.

882
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:51,867
So make a list of things that you want definitely,
and those otherwise you can try later on some

883
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:59,297
that you want to buy personally but actually
these things are so common and so understandable

884
01:20:59,297 --> 01:21:06,247
you write it down whatever you want for your
puja.

885
01:21:06,247 --> 01:21:07,247
Have you got any list?

886
01:21:07,247 --> 01:21:09,297
Of say what one needs for the puja?

887
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,747
No all together what you want to buy?

888
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:15,287
Then make a list now, sit down and make a
list, now when you’ve made the list, I’ll

889
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,227
send somebody to Bombay who will purchase
all these things, keep ready for you, put

890
01:21:17,227 --> 01:21:22,757
the price for you, you pay them and you take
them.

891
01:21:22,757 --> 01:21:29,157
I don’t think you’ll have much chance
to go to any shop and I would advise don’t

892
01:21:29,157 --> 01:21:31,767
go to any shop on a Saturday.

893
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:39,497
On the contrary, you just go to the airport,
rest there and take your things.

894
01:21:39,497 --> 01:21:51,297
Yogi: They reach on Friday night, they have
all day Saturday and they go in the small

895
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:52,297
hours of Sunday morning.

896
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:54,827
Shri Mataji: Why do you want them to go on
Friday night?

897
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:58,457
Better let them go on Saturday morning.

898
01:21:58,457 --> 01:22:01,027
Yogi: They choose that.

899
01:22:01,027 --> 01:22:03,597
Shri Mataji: I see.

900
01:22:03,597 --> 01:22:05,987
And what about you people?

901
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,067
Yogi: We’re going the next day.

902
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:12,447
We’ll leave on Saturday and the flights
not only until Tuesday or Wednesday.

903
01:22:12,447 --> 01:22:13,927
Shri Mataji: All right.

904
01:22:13,927 --> 01:22:18,527
Yogi: But if you suggest Mother that they
go on Saturday they’ll do it.

905
01:22:18,527 --> 01:22:21,477
No, is better go earlier because in any case.

906
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:29,377
You know why I was saying that maybe you see
cars and this and that supposing it fails

907
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:34,547
or something better to be there one day earlier.

908
01:22:34,547 --> 01:22:39,437
Try if you can get something because Saturday’s
such a crowded thing there, I don’t know.

909
01:22:39,437 --> 01:22:41,966
Yogi: We’ll still make this common list
for the puja.

910
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:43,997
Shri Mataji: In any case you should.

911
01:22:43,997 --> 01:22:51,317
Whatever you have is all right, if you don’t
have you better make it here, I mean you spend

912
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:57,557
so much time making the mookhut, what’s
the need?

913
01:22:57,557 --> 01:23:04,057
You can get it here ready made, very good
ones, any amount, any type you want, if you

914
01:23:04,057 --> 01:23:07,637
want to do it you can do it but normally there’s
no need.

915
01:23:07,637 --> 01:23:09,997
Yogi: They don’t know what mookhut is Mother?

916
01:23:09,997 --> 01:23:10,997
Shri Mataji: Huh?

917
01:23:10,997 --> 01:23:13,367
Yogi: You better tell them what mookhut is.

918
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:15,437
Shri Mataji: Mookhut is the crown.

919
01:23:15,437 --> 01:23:16,437
Yes.

920
01:23:16,437 --> 01:23:20,117
All right, by all means you can see.

921
01:23:20,117 --> 01:23:22,197
It’s done or not.

922
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:26,537
Yogi: [HINDI – Requesting Shri Mataji to
vibrate kumkum for Australia.]

923
01:23:26,537 --> 01:23:29,077
Shri Mataji: Ha, Ha, please bring it.

924
01:23:29,077 --> 01:23:31,677
[Individual conversations between Shri Mataji
and Yogi continues]

925
01:23:31,677 --> 01:23:35,387
Shri Mataji: For the hair, coconut oil is
the best.

926
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:38,177
If before going, whatever silver you have
got you put it in your suitcase.

927
01:23:38,177 --> 01:23:41,797
Find it also customs you just … [voice breaks
a bit] Please tell them frankly that these

928
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:46,247
are [Shri Mataji requests to increase the
volume of the microphone] … these are your

929
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:51,197
wedding presents, would be better if you wrap
it with some …

930
01:23:51,197 --> 01:24:01,487
Shri Mataji tells a yogi specifically: It’s
not meant for you in any case, meant for married

931
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:02,487
people.

932
01:24:02,487 --> 01:24:07,607
In case you are carrying the silver with you
then put it in your suitcases with a wrapper,

933
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:11,677
with the wishing of somebody like that for
your marriage.

934
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,537
You should say, “We got married.”

935
01:24:14,537 --> 01:24:17,877
Or, somebody has to say, “We re-married.

936
01:24:17,877 --> 01:24:19,307
It’s a present.”

937
01:24:19,307 --> 01:24:22,067
And, they won’t say anything to you.

938
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:25,157
But in any case, they won’t see anything,
I hope so.

939
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:28,867
Next time when you come don’t bring any
nonsensical thing like the one you brought

940
01:24:28,867 --> 01:24:29,937
last time.

941
01:24:29,937 --> 01:24:35,287
First was My television set the way it was
ruined.

942
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:38,196
It’s all absurd ideas, I never do like that.

943
01:24:38,196 --> 01:24:39,966
You need not try to avoid paying customs.

944
01:24:39,966 --> 01:24:46,207
We have to pay where you have to pay.

945
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:51,997
So, whatever you are bringing, each person
should not bring more that five hundred rupees

946
01:24:51,997 --> 01:24:53,257
worth, means about say, about twenty-five
pounds.

947
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:56,877
Secondly, that whenever you bring such things
like tapes you should divide them into different

948
01:24:56,877 --> 01:24:57,877
people and then bring it.

949
01:24:57,877 --> 01:24:58,877
Don’t bring them together.

950
01:24:58,877 --> 01:24:59,877
Thirdly, whatever you bring you don’t send
it back without asking Me.

951
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:00,877
There’s no logic in it.

952
01:25:00,877 --> 01:25:05,717
All the way you bring something here and why
do you send it back?

953
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:09,687
Again, this is the same brain I think which
I cannot explain.

954
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:11,677
Nobody can explain this.

955
01:25:11,677 --> 01:25:14,167
Yen, who took them back?

956
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:16,157
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

957
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:19,657
Shri Mataji: Who is he?

958
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:21,837
From Bristol?

959
01:25:21,837 --> 01:25:25,037
You know we have paid for that.

960
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:26,187
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

961
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,337
Shri Mataji: But why?

962
01:25:27,337 --> 01:25:29,067
English originals, why did you send?

963
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:31,927
You see, you are made in-charge of that, have
you?

964
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:33,827
Who has made you in-charge?

965
01:25:33,827 --> 01:25:36,107
Warren made you in-charge, did he?

966
01:25:36,107 --> 01:25:37,997
Then, did you ask Warren?

967
01:25:37,997 --> 01:25:43,877
You don’t know you have sent also in that,
I had saved some tapes which were the bhajan

968
01:25:43,877 --> 01:25:44,877
tapes.

969
01:25:44,877 --> 01:25:49,467
I saved them that time when I was giving.

970
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:52,997
I said, “Keep them for the villagers.”

971
01:25:52,997 --> 01:25:57,068
I’m saying did you appoint him as the in-charge
of the tapes?

972
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,068
All right.

973
01:25:58,068 --> 01:26:00,257
What, he didn’t do these tapes.

974
01:26:00,257 --> 01:26:05,257
The tapes that he has sent back, he never
did it.

975
01:26:05,257 --> 01:26:07,077
That’s done by Paul.

976
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:11,317
We have purchased them, gave it to Paul for
doing it.

977
01:26:11,317 --> 01:26:17,067
Now, I saved these ones when I was giving
the presents to people.

978
01:26:17,067 --> 01:26:19,417
I said, “Save these.”

979
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:24,966
Because I have to take them for distribution
for the villagers and these tapes were sent

980
01:26:24,966 --> 01:26:25,966
back.

981
01:26:25,966 --> 01:26:26,966
He never asked Me.

982
01:26:26,966 --> 01:26:28,417
See, this is the trouble.

983
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:34,197
When you are in-charge, doesn’t mean you
can do things like that.

984
01:26:34,197 --> 01:26:38,767
These are not your tapes that you sent them.

985
01:26:38,767 --> 01:26:43,847
We paid for it, we got it done through Paul.

986
01:26:43,847 --> 01:26:47,147
It has nothing to do with you.

987
01:26:47,147 --> 01:26:50,357
You never did these tapes.

988
01:26:50,357 --> 01:26:51,357
Nothing.

989
01:26:51,357 --> 01:26:53,567
No, you did not.

990
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:54,847
I know.

991
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:56,777
Paul did it.

992
01:26:56,777 --> 01:27:16,797
It was given to Paul, we paid for it, we asked
Paul to do it.

993
01:27:16,797 --> 01:27:21,667
He did it.

994
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:33,057
These tapes are not done by you.

995
01:27:33,057 --> 01:27:39,287
If you have done it I don’t know but as
far as I know, they are done by Paul.

996
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:45,357
And, I kept them back, I didn’t give them.

997
01:27:45,357 --> 01:27:53,517
Yesterday, I was really crestfallen because
I had told them that I’ll give it to the

998
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:54,517
bhajan-mandals.

999
01:27:54,517 --> 01:27:59,367
And, it was not there.

1000
01:27:59,367 --> 01:28:08,077
They asked Me, “Where are the tapes You
had promised us, Mother?”

1001
01:28:08,077 --> 01:28:09,957
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

1002
01:28:09,957 --> 01:28:15,677
Shri Mataji: I think you do not know because
I had kept about forty tapes or thirty tapes

1003
01:28:15,677 --> 01:28:18,337
which were of Indian bhajans separately with
that.

1004
01:28:18,337 --> 01:28:20,007
But what was the hurry?

1005
01:28:20,007 --> 01:28:26,017
If you have to send something, you can always
send it later.

1006
01:28:26,017 --> 01:28:28,716
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

1007
01:28:28,716 --> 01:28:32,767
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

1008
01:28:32,767 --> 01:28:35,147
You just sent the lot.

1009
01:28:35,147 --> 01:28:36,147
How do you know?

1010
01:28:36,147 --> 01:28:37,257
You didn’t see everything.

1011
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:41,107
Definitely, they are gone but why do anything
without asking?

1012
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,187
First of all, always do things with asking.

1013
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:46,487
You shouldn’t behave arbitrarily, first
point.

1014
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:50,337
Second point is that these things can be done
later.

1015
01:28:50,337 --> 01:28:51,397
What is the hurry?

1016
01:28:51,397 --> 01:28:56,676
Even Warren asks Me if he has to do something.

1017
01:28:56,676 --> 01:28:59,807
Is a very common thing I know with the Western
mind.

1018
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:00,807
I’ve known that.

1019
01:29:00,807 --> 01:29:03,047
I’ll tell you people used to live in My
house, they would just walk off keeping the

1020
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:04,817
door open, just walk off.

1021
01:29:04,817 --> 01:29:05,877
Where’s he gone?

1022
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:06,877
God knows!

1023
01:29:06,877 --> 01:29:07,877
He’s walked off.

1024
01:29:07,877 --> 01:29:08,877
Very common.

1025
01:29:08,877 --> 01:29:09,877
He just walked off.

1026
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:11,207
Where did he go?

1027
01:29:11,207 --> 01:29:17,457
I mean, even if we have to go the bathroom,
we’ll tell somebody, “I’m going to the

1028
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:18,457
bathroom.”

1029
01:29:18,457 --> 01:29:20,557
That’s our habit.

1030
01:29:20,557 --> 01:29:26,517
No, it’s all right whatever it is but I’d
saved these.

1031
01:29:26,517 --> 01:29:31,267
Now, I cannot locate it because it’s not
there.

1032
01:29:31,267 --> 01:29:36,557
There was no need to send them back at all.

1033
01:29:36,557 --> 01:29:38,177
What was the hurry?

1034
01:29:38,177 --> 01:29:39,187
To whom are you committed?

1035
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:44,637
If not to Me, at least to Warren.

1036
01:29:44,637 --> 01:29:48,347
Why they arranged these things?

1037
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:52,817
I think something goes out there.

1038
01:29:52,817 --> 01:29:53,817
You better look after yourself.

1039
01:29:53,817 --> 01:29:55,567
You have to do sadhana.

1040
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:58,347
You all must do sadhana.

1041
01:29:58,347 --> 01:30:08,748
There’s one more thing: is that by saying
I’m a Sahaja Yogi, by believing I’m a

1042
01:30:08,748 --> 01:30:13,957
Sahaja Yogi, you are not going to be helped.

1043
01:30:13,957 --> 01:30:15,427
You have to do your meditation sincerely.

1044
01:30:15,427 --> 01:30:17,417
You see, I know it’s not hypocrisy.

1045
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:18,417
But also it is not all out sincere effort.

1046
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:19,417
There’s something in between, the limbo
I would say.

1047
01:30:19,417 --> 01:30:20,417
That’s not the way.

1048
01:30:20,417 --> 01:30:22,467
We think we are Sahaja Yogis.

1049
01:30:22,467 --> 01:30:24,837
All right, then do it.

1050
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:30,617
You have to everyday; all these Indian Sahaja
Yogis meditate everyday.

1051
01:30:30,617 --> 01:30:31,617
Everyday.

1052
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:35,657
They are much more in a way evolved.

1053
01:30:35,657 --> 01:30:38,216
They have a much better background.

1054
01:30:38,216 --> 01:30:40,777
We have to fight all that.

1055
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:43,337
Everyday, they cannot live without it.

1056
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,337
All right?

1057
01:30:44,337 --> 01:30:50,317
Now, try to meditate, try to take out because
you have problems there.

1058
01:30:50,317 --> 01:30:53,267
That’s how you go off.

1059
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:57,437
Now, just don’t do anything arbitrarily,
ask ten people.

1060
01:30:57,437 --> 01:30:59,297
I also ask you.

1061
01:30:59,297 --> 01:31:01,607
I don’t do anything arbitrarily.

1062
01:31:01,607 --> 01:31:08,827
Yesterday, when all the leaders were there,
I asked them what is to be done, isn’t it,

1063
01:31:08,827 --> 01:31:09,827
Warren?

1064
01:31:09,827 --> 01:31:10,827
Asked everyone.

1065
01:31:10,827 --> 01:31:14,147
I can do everything Myself, I don’t do that.

1066
01:31:14,147 --> 01:31:19,367
It’s a collective thing, you cannot do anything
like that.

1067
01:31:19,367 --> 01:31:23,507
All right, that’s one thing now.

1068
01:31:23,507 --> 01:31:25,307
Thank you very much.

1069
01:31:25,307 --> 01:31:26,946

you.

Felicity, you sit down.

1076
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:41,407
I have to tell you one thing.

1077
01:31:41,407 --> 01:31:46,197
In Sahaja Yoga, you have come here to achieve
an ascent.

1078
01:31:46,197 --> 01:31:52,867
You know you had lots of problems.

1079
01:31:52,867 --> 01:31:56,837
You have not come here to achieve any positions,
know that.

1080

If you want to achieve positions, why don’t
you go to politics and spare us?

what you like.

you better talk to Lori.

can’t imagine.

1131
01:35:32,317 --> 01:35:37,247
All right, now go ahead and don’t do all
these things.

1132
01:35:37,247 --> 01:35:38,687
It hurts Me.

1133
01:35:38,687 --> 01:35:41,557
I mean, I just don’t understand.

1134
01:35:41,557 --> 01:35:46,397
You have been with Me for so many days and
this thing, I’ve loved you so much, just

1135
01:35:46,397 --> 01:35:47,397
can’t understand.

1136
01:35:47,397 --> 01:35:49,687
Why do you want to hurt Me?

1137
01:35:49,687 --> 01:35:51,437
All right, get up now.

1138
01:35:51,437 --> 01:35:55,507
Now for something nice, we should say it’s
done is done, finished.

1139
01:35:55,507 --> 01:36:10,227
You see, sometimes the ocean of forgiveness
gets so filled up that some of it like what

1140
01:36:10,227 --> 01:36:18,387
you call the tushar in Marathi we say.

1141
01:36:18,387 --> 01:36:23,367
I don’t know in English what is the word
is.

1142
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:26,807
Some drops come out from that on the shore.

1143
01:36:26,807 --> 01:36:37,047
Try to love each other, try to be helpful
to each other, try to enjoy others – that’s

1144
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,827
what you are here for.

1145
01:36:38,827 --> 01:36:46,027
Keep to your age, keep to your levels, keep
to your growth and also, you must understand

1146
01:36:46,027 --> 01:36:57,267
that respect if you give, you get the respect
also.

1147
01:36:57,267 --> 01:37:49,997
This is not the way one should behave in Sahaja
Yoga.

1148
01:37:49,997 --> 01:38:11,707
I’m trying to build up a new world.

1149
01:38:11,707 --> 01:38:15,687
You are doing God’s work.

1150
01:38:15,687 --> 01:38:28,097
Just find out have you got sufficiently enough
understanding what work you are taking.

1151
01:38:28,097 --> 01:38:37,077
Arbitrary behavior is absolutely cancerous
for Sahaja Yoga.

1152
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:45,647
Anybody does that, you point it out to others,
“This is arbitrary.”

1153
01:38:45,647 --> 01:38:49,737
This has been done very much before also.

1154
01:38:49,737 --> 01:38:53,867
You know how the money was collected arbitrarily
by Patrick.

1155
01:38:53,867 --> 01:38:59,687
Terrible things happened and everybody supported
him, even Steve and everyone and people sent

1156
01:38:59,687 --> 01:39:01,807
him money without asking Me.

1157
01:39:01,807 --> 01:39:03,497
This is very sad.

1158
01:39:03,497 --> 01:39:18,747
You are all Sahaja Yogis of such a level and
you must come up to that level and see that

1159
01:39:18,747 --> 01:39:28,057
you are the people who are going to change
the whole world.

1160
01:39:28,057 --> 01:39:35,497
You are the foundation of that.

1161
01:39:35,497 --> 01:39:45,097
No arbitrary behavior should be there but
an understanding because you have to receive

1162
01:39:45,097 --> 01:39:49,627
so much.

1163
01:39:49,627 --> 01:39:57,067
Unless and until, you are respectful, you
cannot receive anything.

1164
01:39:57,067 --> 01:40:01,847
Whatever you have to do please ask your leaders.

1165
01:40:01,847 --> 01:40:04,577
Don’t do anything arbitrarily.

1166
01:40:04,577 --> 01:40:16,757
The leader may be younger than you, may be
older than you, may be now he is appointed,

1167
01:40:16,757 --> 01:40:19,647
you are an old Sahaja Yogi.

1168
01:40:19,647 --> 01:40:25,437
Doesn’t matter, I know whom to appoint,
I’ve appointed that person there.

1169
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,317
All right.

1170
01:40:27,317 --> 01:40:35,837
I hope you will give Me joy and happiness
as I have always tried to give you.

1171
01:40:35,837 --> 01:40:37,017
May God bless you!

1172
01:40:37,017 --> 01:40:43,177
Now, the ladies have arrived and they want
to give bangles to the ladies.

1173
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:50,657
They have brought the bangles for you.

1174
01:40:50,657 --> 01:40:59,177
The reason is tomorrow is a great day, what
we call the Sankrant.

1175
01:40:59,177 --> 01:41:04,587
Is a day when the Sun changes its meridian?

1176
01:41:04,587 --> 01:41:09,927
It moves from the South to the North, towards
the Cancer.

1177
01:41:09,927 --> 01:41:13,277
It moves towards the Cancer, you see.

1178
01:41:13,277 --> 01:41:31,467
And, that’s how tomorrow is a very great
day for us, fourteenth.

1179
01:41:31,467 --> 01:41:44,946
That day we say that that’s the day lots
of things happen.

1180
01:41:44,946 --> 01:41:49,817
So, San Krant.

1181
01:41:49,817 --> 01:41:56,067
Krant means revolution and San means holy.

1182
01:41:56,067 --> 01:42:19,637
So is a day of holy revolution.

1183
01:42:19,637 --> 01:42:29,107
Luckily we are here, we’ll be having a nice
puja, we’ll have an international puja also,

1184
01:42:29,107 --> 01:42:33,057
everything will be done tomorrow very nicely.

1185
01:42:33,057 --> 01:43:02,777
Now, one thing we have to do today that these
ladies have come to give bangles to you, to

1186
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:04,417
all the ladies.

1187
01:43:04,417 --> 01:43:07,977
They have got all sizes.

1188
01:43:07,977 --> 01:43:16,167
They showed Me what sizes I should take.

1189
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:56,567
I told them some of them should

1190
01:43:56,567 --> 01:43:57,567
be maximum.

1191
01:43:57,567 --> 01:43:58,567
[laughter] And, they’ve brought it.

1192
01:43:58,567 --> 01:44:06,696
So as many as you can have, please have it.

1193
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:08,897
All right?

1194
01:44:08,897 --> 01:44:11,097
[applause]

1195
01:44:11,097 --> 01:44:36,737
[Marathi] We don’t offer them to men because
it is insulting.

1196
01:44:36,737 --> 01:45:03,257
When

1197
01:45:03,257 --> 01:45:32,716
the men don’t go for
a fight or they behave cowardly then women

1198
01:45:32,716 --> 01:46:09,317
offer their bangles to men that, “You better
wear them, sit at home and I’ll go on

1199
01:46:09,317 --> 01:46:17,797
the war.”

1200
01:46:17,797 --> 01:46:29,257
There’s a saying, “Bangadya bhara.”

1201
01:46:29,257 --> 01:47:02,897
Means to men if you say that

1202
01:47:02,897 --> 01:47:13,387
that means now you are a coward.

1203
01:47:13,387 --> 01:47:23,176
Means that in all languages.

1204
01:47:23,176 --> 01:47:36,367
It’s a sanctuary here, so many birds.

1205
01:47:36,367 --> 01:47:57,837
Have you seen those birds before or only they
have arrived today?

1206
01:47:57,837 --> 01:48:10,047
Just go

1207
01:48:10,047 --> 01:48:23,937
and have

1208
01:48:23,937 --> 01:48:25,527
a look.

1209
01:48:25,527 --> 01:48:40,477
We have everything by the kilos, you see.
