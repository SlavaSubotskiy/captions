1
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:21,824
It is inaction.

2
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:28,581
When you say , how we should do it, then we are thinking, that is not sahaj.

3
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:34,130
	You cannot go back saying that I don’t do anything.

4
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:40,327
You are all the time forward, moving forward, saying how?

5
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:46,363
	How to do? How to go forward?

6
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:57,644
 Accepting that this event takes place towards consciousness

7
00:00:57,669 --> 00:01:02,102
and that consciousness itself makes it happen.

8
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:07,015
We should stop trying to make any effort completely.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,203
When we are in Akarma then only this consciousness takes place.

10
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,255
That means you don’t have to do anything at all.

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,695
This is a very difficult task for human beings.

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,604
If nothing else is there, man keeps thinking.

13
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:28,809
But when this event takes place, thoughts also stop.

14
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,693
Because till now whatever daily spiritual practice you have seen

15
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:34,889
you have to do some or the other action.

16
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:38,686
 And all these actions will take you outwards.

17
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:43,473
Sahaja Yoga is an event that takes place inside.

18
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:46,925
When people ask how to surrender?

19
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,191
It is clear cut, you do not have to do anything,  you are surrendered.

20
00:01:54,216 --> 00:02:01,796
Man has never walked at this speed in this direction till now.

21
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,703
So it is a new thing for him

22
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,547
and a new path in which he does not have to do anything.

23
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,859
Events take place on their own.

24
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:15,129
Because he has done a lot and has gone very far away from his inner self

25
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:18,883
and that is why it is very difficult to pull such a person inwards.

26
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:23,762
That is why someone’s Kundalini gets awakened instantaneously

27
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:31,923
 whereas for some even their awakened Kundalini falls down again.

28
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:36,331
Nothing is to be done, this is surrendering.

29
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:41,197
When you reach that point, nothing is to be done.

30
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,595
Where you don't say anything, you are thoughtless.

31
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,673
But this also has to be done.

32
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:51,348
A human being has to do this also.

33
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:54,796
So, leave it to the one who will do it.

34
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,634
You don't have to do anything.

35
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,038
You just leave it.

36
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,350
If someone new has come and asks what do we need to do

37
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,559
 just open your palms towards me.

38
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,614
keep your hands straight like this and it will happen.

39
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,554
For those for whom this event does not take place

40
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,767
these people here will help you afterwards.

41
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,848
Today there are so many Sahaja Yogis here

42
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,756
and each of them has achieved his self-realization.

43
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:18,375
Not only that, they have a very deep knowledge of the Kundalini science.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,774
Each one of them  seated here is proficient in the Kundalini science

45
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,201
and  the Kundalinis of thousands of people by just using their finger movements

46
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,549
can raise and not only that, they can also give them self-realization.

47
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,688
And you may ask why don’t they do it then?

48
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:39,324
The reason is that people do not come to Sahaja Yoga very easily.

49
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,218
It is very difficult for a human being to come to a place

50
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,817
where it is told that you don’t have to give any money

51
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,453
where you don’t have to do anything, but just have to sit in silence.

52
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,561
But when they start  sinking, they come.

53
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:54,781
That is why Sahaja Yoga cannot work too fast

54
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:59,540
because  in Sahaja Yoga, you have to give up some thing.

55
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:04,260
 Meaning that we have to do something

56
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,373
we have to think about something or we have to stand on our head

57
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,568
 or we have to perform some Dravidi Pranayam (Hatha yoga)

58
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:14,437
or we have to read some books or we have to memorize some texts

59
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:20,104
or we have to say some mantras, just leave all this.

60
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,998
Then after getting your self-realization

61
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:27,666
 you become deserving.

62
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:30,917
Then whatever needs to be done, happens

63
00:04:30,942 --> 00:04:36,041
Akarma only, inaction only, comes into action.

64
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,901
karma becomes chariot.......

65
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:41,612
So how? See for yourself.

66
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:44,643
Whatever has to happen will happen and whatever has not to happen, will not.

67
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,229
There is no compulsion in this, no argument.

68
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,073
For whom it has to happen will happen, and for whom it doesn’t have to, it will not.

69
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,024
	If someone has blockages in chakras, it is there.

70
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:56,140
It can be taken out but cannot be argued.

71
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:59,423
People have various issues, for example, people say we did not do it

72
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:01,482
 If they have blockages, they do have.

73
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:02,983
These should be taken out.

74
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:07,763
Now look for your own selfishness, know the meaning of your self.

75
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:12,701
This is not going to benefit me, it benefits you only. fully

76
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,988
Only you are going to get all the benefit.

77
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:24,719
Understand this and open your palms like this.

78
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,260
When the event takes place

79
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,876
 first kundalini rises and crosses the Agnya chakra.

80
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:35,776
When this happens you become thoughtless

81
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:37,137
We should say 'Samadhi'.

82
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:43,649
But Samadhi does not mean being unconscious, going into trance, 'No'.

83
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:46,617
Then you are totally conscious and aware.

84
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:50,807
You are fully alert but at the same time you are thoughtless and silent.

85
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,615
But you are listening to everything

86
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,041
and there are no thoughts arising inside from your ego or superego.

87
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,302
You are in peace and joy.

88
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:06,329
And when Kundalini pieces your Fontanel bone then inside you these vibrations

89
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:08,948
about which Shankaracharya has spoken, start flowing.

90
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:10,580
It is so straight-forward.

91
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,562
You don’t have to do anything in this.

92
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:16,665
Like one lighted candle can instantaneously lit another

93
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,625
and take the lamp from the finite to the infinite

94
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,405
it happens the same way.

95
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,933
There is no role of intelligence in this.

96
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:32,128
	Everyone put your hands like this and sit comfortably.

97
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:33,698
Those who have not received their self-realization yet

98
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:37,308
should keep their eyes open for some time.

99
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:44,969
If you have a problem while sitting down, you can sit on chair, no problem.

100
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:49,956
Are you sitting comfortably?

101
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:52,513
If someone’s hands are shaking

102
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:58,232
keep eyes open, otherwise keep your eyes closed.

103
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:00,380
Even with the eyes closed

104
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:24,447
if the eye-lids are moving then you can open your eyes.

105
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:28,554
Those who are swimmers they will first teach you how to swim.

106
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,259
So keep sitting peacefully. Don't move your hands and feet.

107
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,906
They will come and teach you.

108
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,307
( NOT CLEAR )

109
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:41,323
Close your eyes. Close your eyes, you close your eyes.

110
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:46,586
Are your eyes moving? Do you have any guru?
