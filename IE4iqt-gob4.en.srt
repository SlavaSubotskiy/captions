1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:09,011
… the most honorable sahaja yogi,
Justice Vaidya,

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,226
and his most loving wife.

3
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:21,965
Mr. Bakshi, (…tape interruption…) Dhumal,

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:28,383
Mr. Gavin Brown who is an archeologist,

5
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:31,807
Dr. Pramila Sharma, who is a Professor
of Hindi

6
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:37,264
and is a Master of Kabira’s literature,

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,539
and then Mrs. Jane Brown who is
a geologist,

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,319
they are from Cambridge University;

9
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,151
and our wise chairman Mr. Zachre,

10
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:59,368
also the gracious singer Mrs. Shobha Gotu

11
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:04,268
who has been very kind to come and sing,
and in Marathi she said:

12
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,375
"I'm unable to do anything else, so Mother,
I will just sing two bhajans for You."

13
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:15,204
All the sahaja yogis who have come here,

14
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:22,502
 all the other people who have joined us
here,

15
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:27,591
who are celebrating this earthly birthday
of mine…

16
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:31,816
 I am very thankful, very grateful

17
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:37,286
and I am filled with great joy
and happiness.

18
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:42,252
And my vibrations are flowing from my eyes
as tears to see

19
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:48,972
that, in this Kaliyuga also, there are
people who are grateful to a Mother

20
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:53,738
who just gives a abstract thing known
as vibrations.

21
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,588
Actually I do not give you… I cannot give
or take, you’ll be surprised.

22
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,544
It is just emitted through me. It is
my ‘swabhava’ [innate nature].

23
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:08,877
It has to be that way, I can’t help it.

24
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:15,448
It is a ‘being’ that is being. You cannot
make it something else.

25
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:19,098
 It acts on its own; it goes on working.

26
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,477
It is beyond me to control myself from
loving all of you.

27
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,220
 I do not know how people learn to hate.

28
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:31,874
I haven’t got sufficient time even to love
people.

29
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:35,352
I find twenty-four hours much less!

30
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:41,555
I do not know how people sit down
and manipulate and think

31
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:48,237
in a ice-cold manner how to be hateful.

32
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:53,127
Hatred has no power but of destruction -
of yourself and others.

33
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:58,301
On this day I would request you to think
of love all the time.

34
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:02,728
Love is all knowledge. Knowledge is
all love.

35
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,657
There is nothing beyond them.

36
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:11,001
If you have knowledge, it has to pass
the test of love.

37
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:17,417
If you know a person, it makes no record
on you

38
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:22,628
because you know him from outside.
But if you love a person,

39
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,682
then you know the person out and out.

40
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:31,048
You know him so well, you know him
everything, the way it is.

41
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:36,215
It is this knowledge that is what we call
is the ‘para’-knowledge.

42
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,589
That is the knowledge we have to seek.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,300
All these books are only signaling towards
that.

44
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:47,982
They are the milestones, which are telling
us, “Go ahead, go ahead.”

45
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:52,167
They do not solve the problem of entering
 into the kingdom of God.

46
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:56,972
I request you that you all should come
to the stage

47
00:03:57,173 --> 00:04:02,851
of understanding the Divine within you,
the love of God

48
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:06,259
that is within you, which is trying
to overflow from you,

49
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,792
and enjoy the sense of emitting and giving.

50
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:13,023
Giving has the greatest joy and pleasure.

51
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:19,302
There is no pleasure in taking. And when
you receive it, you start giving.

52
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:24,665
You have heard Dhumal talking about how
he has done work in Rahuri.

53
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,039
In Rahuri, when I was going to Rahuri
University,

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,639
the people in the nearby village knew
that our car will be going that way.

55
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,567
They are ordinary villagers. They have
never read any Yoga;

56
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:40,329
they don’t understand anything more about
vibrations

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,695
 than these feelings that you get.
It's a subjective knowledge.

58
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:47,214
It has no words. It's a subjective
experience,

59
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:52,200
which you feel on your fingers, in your
being - the bliss of God.

60
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:56,371
And as I was going, I just felt a jerk
in the car,

61
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,007
because so many people were just lying
on the road

62
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,047
and some were standing on the road stopping
the car,

63
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,835
and they started shouting My ‘jai’
[Victory]. I was wonderstruck!

64
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:08,182
I said, “How did you know that I was
in this car?”

65
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,801
He said, “Mataji, You have given us
vibrations.

66
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,419
We knew this was the car, which was
bringing us vibrations.

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,553
So, now You have to get down here.” I just
got down; I embraced all of them,

68
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,845
and our sahaja yogis were waiting at
the other end. I said, “ Doesn’t matter.”

69
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:26,613
This is what is Sahaja - such loving people!
And at that time, I just thought of

70
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:30,289
how once with Rama - how you felt those
things

71
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,305
with people, with very simple people, of
very simple heart with ‘Shraddha’ [Faith],

72
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:42,157
how they had those feelings of receiving
your love and feeling it.

73
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:46,465
Everyone needs love in this world; you
cannot exist without love.

74
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,932
Your whole being is based on love.

75
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:53,873
And I wish all of you in this country
to understand

76
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:59,676
that unless and until there is love in your
heart, don’t try to do anything outside

77
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,730
because if you do it you will be found out
in no time.

78
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,475
Every human being understands what is love.

79
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:09,161
There are lots of things that are happening
within you.

80
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:12,966
There are cosmic changes that are taking
place today within you.

81
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:17,464
I know that it's happening. The Shri
Chakra itself has descended on this Earth

82
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,254
and already the Satya Yuga has started.

83
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:23,621
This is the reason, why you are feeling
these vibrations on your fingers

84
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:28,107
and none of these Gurus and Rishis and all
those people have mentioned these things.

85
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:32,010
Because this is only possible when
the Shri Chakra is brought down.

86
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,512
It is here. You have to feel it and
understand it.

87
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:40,048
It is for all of you to accept it with
an open heart.

88
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:44,024
I do not want anything from you.
What can you give me?

89
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:48,441
I do not want anything, but I want
my children to be happy.

90
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,899
I pray for their happiness. I live for them
and all the time,

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,901
whether I am asleep or awakened or
in the middle state,

92
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:01,453
when they call the ‘sabhranta’, I'm just
with you.

93
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,353
Every moment you are in My thoughts.

94
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:09,442
I wish all of you a very, very happy New
Year today because it is Navroz

95
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:15,176
and Navroz is the day when Zartosht started
His work on this world.

96
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:21,917
He was a great sahaja yogi. He was
an incarnation of Dattatreya Himself.

97
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:27,549
...has told you about Mohammad sahib
 I have to tell you that He was My father

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,685
and He was the incarnation of Dattatreya
Himself. He was not an ordinary person.

99
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,773
Though the people tortured His life. Every
moment that He lived they tortured Him.

100
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:43,309
And Hazrat Ali is a very, very great
incarnation

101
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,693
where only once, only once Brahmadeva
has incarnated

102
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:52,107
and He has incarnated as Hazrat Ali.
So, these people are so great!

103
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:54,898
You cannot criticize them. They are
so great -

104
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,981
every word that they have spoken is
a Mantra.

105
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:02,361
Everything they have told you about
this ‘namaaz’,

106
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:05,132
it is nothing but Kundalini ‘jagruti’
[awakening].

107
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,233
Mohammad Sahib has done the greatest
work in Sahaja Yoga

108
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:11,784
and has done the greatest advancement

109
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:16,298
as far as the Kundalini jagruti is
concerned. How can you criticize Him?

110
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:20,547
I can’t bear to hear even a word about -
against Him.

111
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:23,313
I know how much He has been tortured.

112
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:28,690
And the same people, today, are born in
this country who are talking against Him.

113
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:35,039
When you cannot reach even at His feet,
why should you take such a big step?

114
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,665
Understand what have you done in life?
What have you got with yourself,

115
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:43,362
that you are criticizing these great
personalities?

116
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:47,145
Khwaja Nizamuddin Saheb was a great Auliya
[saint] – no doubt about it.

117
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,359
And a horrible king like Khilji tried
to trouble Him,

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,968
and he was himself murdered! And his name
has gone to the dying dust.

119
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,629
Today, Khwaja Nizamuddin Saheb…
you go and see the vibrations there!

120
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,856
You go and see a Chisti… Chisti’s Maqbara
[tomb] also

121
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:08,671
at Ajmer Sharif - you will see the same.
At Patna, you go and see Patna Saheb,

122
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:14,580
where you have got our Mahavir Saheb also -
vibrations are there.

123
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:18,539
All these people are speaking of the same
truth I am telling you.

124
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,621
But today you can make them out.
You will know who they are.

125
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:23,686
Please try to humble down yourself.

126
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:26,678
First of all, get this eternal truth within
yourself.

127
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,595
 Let your being be that subjective
instrument, to understand what is God.

128
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,798
Don’t be driven away by few readings
here and few readings there.

129
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,056
Don’t be driven away by the small-hearted
ideas and the egoistical tomfoolery

130
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:45,455
that is going on - is to make fun
of everyone. Oh Man!

131
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:50,139
Please awaken yourself to this great
occasion of understanding.

132
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,068
This dynamic force is dying to bubble out
of you.

133
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,449
We have to change this world and transform
it into a beautiful creation,

134
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,358
because the Creator will not allow
His creation to be destroyed.

135
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,672
If you do not accept the truth, you will be
destroyed.

136
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:12,266
So please, please, again as a Mother,
I ask you

137
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:18,831
to accept the Divine truth, the Divine love
and to be one with it.

138
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:26,070
I wish all of you, all the sahaja yogis and
all the people who are seeking God,

139
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:32,173
the greatest of greatest, highest
of highest achievement

140
00:10:32,374 --> 00:10:37,378
in the awareness of God and His love.
That is what it is.

141
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,375
Otherwise, the rest of it is all useless.
Those who have sought

142
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:46,354
other kind of satwik or tamasik things
in life have gone to waste.

143
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,817
They have gone to hell and they are
completely destroyed.

144
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:54,142
You do not want to do that. You are simple
people, ordinary people

145
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:56,931
and that's why you are the best people,

146
00:10:57,132 --> 00:10:59,764
because you do not suffer from any
extremes.

147
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:04,628
You have a very simple heart. You are
leading a very religious life

148
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,856
and a sanctified married life. This place
is for the people

149
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:13,098
who are in the middle path of Lord Buddha.

150
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,779
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all the
truths of life and I can prove it to you,

151
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,229
on the Kundalini, that what I say is
the fact – is the fact.

152
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,385
Unless and until you take Hazrat Ali’s
name.

153
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:28,872
your Swadisthan Chakra cannot be cured,
and all the sahaja yogis know about it.

154
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,829
And in the sahaja yogi Puja we have to take

155
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,638
the name of Mohammed Saheb again and again
and that of Hazrat Ali.

156
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,292
And also we have to take the name of Jesus
the Lord,

157
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,631
who is the ‘Ashraya’ [Refuge] of all this
world, described by Shri Krishna

158
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,086
in the Bhagavad Gita - He was
the Mahavishnu.

159
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:51,708
You can read it for yourself and you will
be surprised that all the things

160
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:56,907
described about Mahavishnu are absolutely
the same as Jesus Christ was.

161
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,508
So, I request you not to be so small-minded.

162
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:02,826
You have not known the truth so far.
So, try to understand it –

163
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:06,138
to be subjective, to feel it,
to understand it.

164
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,914
All the books are saying the same thing
as I am saying.

165
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:12,001
Only thing, I can do it. I am not doing it.

166
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,977
It is just happening. I have come
on this Earth

167
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:18,519
just for this ignition. This is the last
point of ignition.

168
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,638
This has to happen and this will happen.
Let us see, in this country,

169
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,197
in this beautiful Yoga Bhumi, how many
people accept it.

170
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:29,600
May God bless you all. Again and again
I bless you.

171
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:33,012
I am going to now London on the 25th
and hope,

172
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:37,336
all of you who have got realization in last
two days, will again

173
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:41,980
come to our program in Bharathiya Vidya
Bhavan on Tuesday we have at 6.30.

174
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:47,631
We have also a very nice center
in Altamount road.

175
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:53,215
You can take the address from here,
on Altamount Road there is a very nice

176
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,643
ground floor flat we have got, in front
of the beauty parlour -

177
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,785
Kamal beauty parlour or something
like that.

178
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:06,170
It is the flat of Miss Moraji who has
kindly given us this flat for use.

179
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:09,672
I hope all of you will take deeper interest
into Sahaja Yog,

180
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,990
learn all the methods and master
the Kundalini.

181
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:17,046
There are so many people among us who
know about it and you can talk to them;

182
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:20,958
even in the programs you can listen to my
lectures by which you will understand.

183
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,872
But it is not the understanding through
your hearing,

184
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:26,773
but it is the understanding through
your heart

185
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:31,299
and through your feeling of vibrations
only, you can judge the Kundalini.

186
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,881
Yesterday I have very much requested you
and again I am requesting you

187
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:41,257
that to understand Sahaja Yoga, you don’t
need too much of brains.

188
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,641
What you need is a heart, is
a 'Shraddha-van' [with faith] heart.

189
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,907
And if you have that, it will work out.
The time has come

190
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,370
for many flowers to be fruits. The time
is there.

191
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:57,080
I thank you again and again for showing
this great love to me. It’s like a…

192
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:03,755
when I feel the ocean of my love, when it
flows to the shores of all your hearts,

193
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:07,764
the shore gives it back as a reaction.
It’s a parabolic movement.

194
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:11,962
When my love passes through you and comes
back to me as love,

195
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,702
I enjoy it. It is such a beautiful
experience.

196
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:18,784
I mean, it is a different experience,
perhaps,

197
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:23,972
that cannot be coined or put into these
mortal words.

198
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:27,384
Thank you very much again and again.
I thank all the trustees

199
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:32,104
and all of you again and again. May God
bless you with all His prosperity,

200
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:36,411
with all His goodness, kindness and
the Eternal.

201
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:42,313
The Paramachaitanya should descend on you
and on your awareness.

202
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,524

203
00:15:57,617 --> 00:16:05,215

204
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:17,497

205
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:27,993

206
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:35,783

207
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:42,029
