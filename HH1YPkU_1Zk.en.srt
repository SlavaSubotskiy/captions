1
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,400
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

2
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:21,207
They had planned everything.

3
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:25,687
They had all the arrangements made

4
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,358
and the sari was missing.

5
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:34,198
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

6
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,952
so now what to do?

7
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:40,334
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

8
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:43,545
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

9
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:45,879
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

10
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,857
otherwise we can have it later.

11
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:52,920
But I was least disturbed,

12
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,065
least upset.

13
00:00:56,185 --> 00:01:00,517
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

14
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,143
But if you have a mental conception,

15
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,308
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

16
00:01:07,428 --> 00:01:10,521
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

17
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:16,443
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

18
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,856
But that is what we cannot do.

19
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:24,111
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

20
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,409
This is what it is.

21
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:34,149
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

22
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,592
That’s one of the things.

23
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:40,429
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

24
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,086
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

25
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:49,682
because we make a mental projection.

26
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:52,082
Mentally we calculate something.

27
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:53,422
This has to be.

28
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:58,914
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

29
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:05,566
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

30
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:08,306
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

31
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:13,147
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

32
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,245
only about two o’clock.

33
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,605
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

34
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:20,429
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

35
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:26,855
So this is how you become avyagra.

36
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:31,408
Vyagra means person who is worried.

37
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:34,798
The one who is not worried.

38
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:37,384
So we worry because of two things.

39
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:45,490
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

40
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,410
Future doesn’t exist.

41
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,036
If you have made up your mind

42
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,801
that this should happen in the future,

43
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:57,570
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

44
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,173
But you have not made any mental picture,

45
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:03,491
you will see what comes on the scene.

46
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:08,224
You’ll watch whatever appears.

47
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:10,988
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

48
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,633
what’s going to happen.

49
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:19,249
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

50
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,980
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:30,062
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

52
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:32,281
and we are not having it.”

53
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,107
So you are upset.

54
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:37,983
What difference does it make?

55
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:43,322
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

56
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,618
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

57
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:50,275
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

58
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,611
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

59
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,910
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

60
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,567
We really decorated ourselves well.

61
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,365
We were all ready for the puja,

62
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,138
we were sitting here for the puja,

63
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:08,648
and now what has happened!

64
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:15,242
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

65
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,065
I knew what was coming.

66
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,961
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

67
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,384
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

68
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,477
I’m busy with Myself.

69
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:39,932
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

70
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:48,667
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

71
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:52,632
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

72
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,939
In India people come.

73
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,092
They keep so much money for buying things.

74
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:01,911
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

75
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,973
what you call traders.

76
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:05,999
The customs are so kind, I mean

77
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,198
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

78
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,629
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

79
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,657
And then they have a mental picture,

80
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:17,379
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

81
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,210
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

82
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,507
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

83
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,312
So then they might go to spend some money.

84
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:31,171
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

85
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,859
It has happened with all of you.

86
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,684
So they go and buy something.

87
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,707
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

88
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:45,220
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,417
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

90
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,338
How many pounds you paid for that?

91
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,204
Gavin: Forty pounds.

92
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,359
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

93
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,009
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

94
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,984
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

95
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:06,778
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

96
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,249
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

97
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:14,424
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

98
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,111
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

99
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,572
They thought they’ve bought something great.

100
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,004
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

101
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,786
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

102
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,683
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,670
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,642
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

105
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:40,166
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

106
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:43,519
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

107
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,920
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

108
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,464
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

109
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:51,585
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

110
00:06:51,705 --> 00:06:54,476
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

111
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:57,252
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

112
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,344
He said, “What is the price?”

113
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:01,987
I said, “Forty pounds.”

114
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,062
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

115
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:08,688
And he bought it for forty pounds.

116
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:11,214
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

117
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:14,984
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

118
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:20,653
And I found it out that,

119
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,595
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

120
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,338
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

121
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:35,550
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

122
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,278
And if you start making it flexible then

123
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,883
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

124
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,487
very early. Now he’s different.

125
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:47,554
So if you become flexible,

126
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:51,450
then what happens you see the joy of it.

127
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,145
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

128
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:58,448
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

129
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,296
And you can never enjoy it,

130
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:06,342
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

131
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:08,738
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

132
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,580
You see it is all your own creation.

133
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,613
The mental projection is your creation,

134
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:21,556
and also the destruction is your creation.

135
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:26,225
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

136
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:30,660
But who does that is Mahamaya,

137
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,565
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

138
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:38,810
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

139
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,792
I have to go to Birmingham.

140
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:46,237
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

141
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,734
After some time you will find

142
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:51,032
that it’s impossible to do something,

143
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:54,583
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

144
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,460
Because whenever you will try to do something,

145
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,262
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

146
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:05,118
If not, then it will make you realize

147
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:08,365
what is important, what you’ve missed.

148
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,839
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

149
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,120
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,351
What to do? Now where to go?”

151
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:26,067
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

152
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:28,719
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

153
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,536
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

154
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:38,616
for days together. I just see that there.

155
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:50,071
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

156
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,833
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

157
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:57,405
at any cost.

158
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:03,275
Then that acts as a guide

159
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:09,867
and you understand the flexibility

160
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:13,856
of all these worldly, transitory things.

161
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,849
They are all changeable,

162
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:21,589
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

163
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:27,931
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

164
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:32,231
which is very important subject.

165
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:38,585
I think I have talked about it many a times.

166
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,878
But in the West I must say,

167
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:50,565
because of our wrong attitudes

168
00:10:54,348 --> 00:11:00,552
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

169
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:04,499
of other people who are very dominating,

170
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:11,739
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

171
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:17,758
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

172
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:22,797
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

173
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,331
and has sustained itself,

174
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:32,313
we must know that we can always fall a trap

175
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:41,729
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

176
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:47,961
It's a very serious matter

177
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:54,475
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

178
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:59,041
and we have created pathways

179
00:11:59,161 --> 00:12:02,490
into which our attention can go

180
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,217
if we are not very careful.

181
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:11,538
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

182
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:15,131
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

183
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:21,256
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

184
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,668
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

185
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:28,913
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

186
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:39,982
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

187
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:42,854
sin against the Mother,

188
00:12:45,277 --> 00:12:51,133
it's a secretive action

189
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:55,180
that's only between you and yourself.

190
00:12:55,998 --> 00:13:01,162
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

191
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,972
Nobody knows what you are going to do

192
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,597
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

193
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,875
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

194
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:22,300
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

195
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,625
To be very frank with you,

196
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:30,935
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

197
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:38,822
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

198
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:46,501
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

199
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,899
It is not bothered.

200
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:53,347
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

201
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:57,052
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

202
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,276
that's the action it plays all the time.

203
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:03,359
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

204
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,926
I mean the person is very close to Me,

205
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,146
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

206
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:11,055
But still I can?

207
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:15,729
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

208
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:19,202
immediately I can feel it.

209
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:25,484
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

210
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:29,285
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

211
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,742
do what you like.

212
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,826
Now for people who are Indian,

213
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,611
who have respected their Mooladharas,

214
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,552
there are so many methods and ways given

215
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:52,735
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

216
00:14:52,855 --> 00:14:56,602
But that won't work out with the Western people,

217
00:14:56,722 --> 00:15:00,342
because it's a damaged one.

218
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:04,209
It's one which is a shattered one,

219
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:07,885
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

220
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:12,082
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

221
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,856
the left side.

222
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,264
So, even you may not talk in that way,

223
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:28,498
but your mind is still in that realm.

224
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:33,084
And you still think on that realm.

225
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:38,168
Even mentally, you are in it.

226
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,259
Or you are seeing things,

227
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:46,276
wanting to see such things,

228
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:49,714
wanting to enjoy such things.

229
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:53,994
That lurking attraction is still there,

230
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:57,314
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

231
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:04,727
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

232
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:09,575
I would not say the same to the people from India.

233
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:15,154
So now we have to work out much harder.

234
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:21,701
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

235
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:27,919
And it is more a mental activity.

236
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:34,515
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

237
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:37,441
You have to watch your mind.

238
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:42,214
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

239
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:49,918
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

240
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,271
Where is it going?

241
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:57,431
Where is this movement of our mind?

242
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,202
What is it doing?

243
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:03,064
You have to stand against your mind,

244
00:17:03,184 --> 00:17:05,904
stand against your desires,

245
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,084
or you can face it

246
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:13,674
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

247
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:18,106
It's for you to decide.

248
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:22,640
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

249
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,429
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

250
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,772
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

251
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,747
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

252
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,704
Whatever confessions you have made,

253
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:35,224
I burnt all those letters.

254
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:39,201
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

255
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:41,503
Nor do I want to know about it.

256
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:45,064
That's not My concern.

257
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:49,351
My concern is that now

258
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:57,111
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

259
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:01,980
on the same level,

260
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,581
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

261
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,784
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

262
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:15,978
the thoughts that come to you

263
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:18,466
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

264
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:23,107
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

265
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:29,739
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

266
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,473
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

267
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:36,832
which you can ask.

268
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:38,725
But you cannot always say that,

269
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:41,425
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

270
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:44,364
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

271
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:49,015
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

272
00:18:53,962 --> 00:19:02,339
You see a person as a Sakshi.

273
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:06,065
That means you see that person

274
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:10,597
but you do not get a reaction,

275
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:17,348
which is killer of joy.

276
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:25,314
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

277
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:33,352
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

278
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:36,660
And be alert about it.

279
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,635
If you want to be kind to yourself,

280
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:46,711
know that you have to divert your attention

281
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:49,918
towards a sane married life.

282
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,040
But also that should not be too much.

283
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,018
Because what I have learnt now,

284
00:19:57,138 --> 00:20:00,830
that in the West people have devised methods

285
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,359
of transferring their attention

286
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:07,270
from one person to another.

287
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:11,243
Mental acrobatics of different type

288
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:17,091
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

289
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:21,464
Don’t play onto these.

290
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,231
There are so many other things by which

291
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:34,453
we express that we are still under the trap

292
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:36,407
of a bad Mooladhara.

293
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,842
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

294
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:42,435
the way you sit, the way you talk,

295
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:53,776
the way you behave, to impress other people.

296
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,575
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

297
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,727
The only impression that should really work

298
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:10,266
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

299
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:14,845
You can do it; it's not difficult.

300
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:18,586
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

301
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:23,415
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

302
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,797
But your question is first of all

303
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:30,594
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

304
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:36,419
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

305
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,957
That's why I say sometimes

306
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:44,289
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

307
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,117
especially the red meats and beefs,

308
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:54,004
and horses, and dogs

309
00:21:56,058 --> 00:22:00,212
and I don't know what else you eat.

310
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:07,184
Take more to vegetarian food.

311
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:10,824
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

312
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,520
Take more to things

313
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,365
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

314
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:22,018
Even fish is very [inaudible].

315
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:27,027
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

316
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:32,688
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

317
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:35,188
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

318
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:38,537
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

319
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:43,305
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

320
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:47,910
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

321
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:51,904
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

322
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,644
So for you people,

323
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,027
(You have to go?)

324
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:10,436
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

325
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:16,021
that food does make a difference

326
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,931
in the powers of Mooladhara.

327
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:24,653
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

328
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:28,309
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

329
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:31,053
over-excited.

330
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,732
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

331
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:35,425
any woman you look at ...

332
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:39,049
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

333
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,506
Horrible.

334
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:44,887
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

335
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:50,505
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

336
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,268
There's no grace.

337
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,679
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

338
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,824
“you must respect yourself.”

339
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:03,553
It cannot work out with those words I know.

340
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,197
You have to sit down,

341
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:18,327
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

342
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,939
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

343
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,458
what things can be done about it,

344
00:24:24,578 --> 00:24:28,422
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

345
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:32,591
But still this is all physical.

346
00:24:32,711 --> 00:24:37,689
Mentally you must be on the watch

347
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:42,220
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

348
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:47,258
Why does it always go to this sensation?

349
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:54,621
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

350
00:24:54,741 --> 00:25:00,447
see the beautiful people, just see them.

351
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,571
Another horrible thing in the West

352
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:07,160
is that the women must expose their body

353
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,561
to get men excited.

354
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:11,619
Men do the same I think.

355
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:13,388
They always try to excite each other

356
00:25:13,508 --> 00:25:17,330
and live in a stupid excitement.

357
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:25,580
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

358
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,547
beautiful ornaments.

359
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:33,561
All right? But you're not a thing!

360
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:45,393
It's your private property.

361
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:50,237
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

362
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:53,485
Better try that, sometimes.

363
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:57,034
You will mind people plundering your gold,

364
00:25:57,154 --> 00:26:00,734
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

365
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:04,640
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

366
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,662
You don't feel insulted?

367
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,562
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

368
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:15,035
It feels happy that people are watching you.

369
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,423
They are plundering you.

370
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:23,022
They are looting your chastity.

371
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:31,217
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

372
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:35,859
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

373
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:42,201
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

374
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:51,692
The minds are very funnily placed,

375
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:55,459
and that's why the greatest complications there are

376
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,746
in the brains of people.

377
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:02,052
They are very confused,

378
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:05,762
very confused people.

379
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:09,208
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

380
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:14,381
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

381
00:27:15,377 --> 00:27:18,353
It is actually just the other way round.

382
00:27:18,473 --> 00:27:22,213
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

383
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,476
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

384
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:28,689
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

385
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:31,248
And why not this property of yours

386
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:32,988
which is the highest of all,

387
00:27:33,108 --> 00:27:36,912
to be preserved, to be adorned,

388
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,854
to be worshipped?

389
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:47,207
I'm quite worried on that point

390
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:53,650
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

391
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,819
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

392
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,122
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

393
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:00,785
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

394
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:03,524
but in this matter they think they can go about

395
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:06,386
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

396
00:28:06,506 --> 00:28:10,454
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

397
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:14,742
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

398
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:18,848
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

399
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:21,556
towards your life, towards your being,

400
00:28:21,676 --> 00:28:25,611
towards your personality. You are saints.

401
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:29,348
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

402
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:32,371
I call it the character, the essence of character,

403
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:35,099
is not a saint.

404
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:42,230
So this purity has to be maintained.

405
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,743
There cannot be any compromise on that.

406
00:28:45,863 --> 00:28:49,835
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

407
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:54,040
If it works out,

408
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,786
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

409
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:02,067
nobody deceives oneself

410
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:06,637
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

411
00:29:06,757 --> 00:29:09,973
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

412
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,613
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

413
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,256
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

414
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:19,639
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

415
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,756
your mind can be cleansed.

416
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:27,959
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

417
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,038
“not this, not this, not this.”

418
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:37,015
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

419
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:40,795
I know it's difficult,

420
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:45,162
but if you can get realization why not this also?

421
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,197
You all have to understand

422
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:51,744
that there is no compromise on this.

423
00:29:51,864 --> 00:29:54,752
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

424
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:57,222
you will be thrown away completely,

425
00:29:57,342 --> 00:30:01,722
just like any other devil is thrown out.

426
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:06,684
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

427
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:10,324
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

428
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,082
You cannot ascend

429
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:16,173
if there is any lurking thing within you.

430
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:19,291
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

431
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:24,016
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

432
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:28,130
Only question is “where is your attention?”

433
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,553
Divert. Divert your attention.

434
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:40,674
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

435
00:30:40,794 --> 00:30:47,056
and afterwards it will come automatically.

436
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:50,827
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

437
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:53,837
On the contrary,

438
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,942
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

439
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,279
So much conditioning is there.

440
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:06,892
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

441
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:10,018
we have ruined ourselves.

442
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:12,747
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

443
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,804
and the worst of all.

444
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:19,408
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

445
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,419
unless and until you individually

446
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,626
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

447
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:34,526
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

448
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:39,247
and the most powerful chakra.

449
00:31:39,988 --> 00:31:47,805
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

450
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:55,108
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

451
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:58,082
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

452
00:31:58,202 --> 00:32:01,142
your wisdom will fail.

453
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:08,114
You will have no sense of direction.

454
00:32:08,234 --> 00:32:11,988
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

455
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:14,081
before they become forty years of age

456
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:16,742
is because their Mooladharas are out.

457
00:32:16,862 --> 00:32:20,285
Most of the diseases which are incurable

458
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:24,571
come because of weak Mooladharas,

459
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:28,006
on the physical side.

460
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:30,129
On the mental side,

461
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:33,423
most of the mental problems we saw there,

462
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:39,207
most, I would say ninety percent,

463
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:41,751
are due to weak Mooladhara.

464
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:44,872
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

465
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:48,054
powerful Mooladhara,

466
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,974
it doesn't get into trouble.

467
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,012
Because you know there's a very strong hold

468
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:57,697
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

469
00:32:57,817 --> 00:33:03,133
And when your mind goes off,

470
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:09,288
you blame the brain.

471
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:14,723
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

472
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:18,866
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

473
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:26,977
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

474
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,514
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

475
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:35,720
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

476
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,114
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

477
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,897
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

478
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:53,628
because the sensationalization

479
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:57,071
has become the main theme of modern life.

480
00:33:57,191 --> 00:34:03,690
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

481
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,975
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

482
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:16,154
Media, books, ideas, everything,

483
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:22,507
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

484
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,779
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

485
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,861
doesn't have any balance.

486
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,529
Actually he's hypocritical,

487
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:40,141
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

488
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:43,473
So many complications take place with this.

489
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:47,623
Before realization, forget the past.

490
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,794
Whatever you have done, forget it.

491
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,288
Just don't worry.

492
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,325
But remember one thing,

493
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:58,214
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

494
00:34:58,334 --> 00:35:01,460
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

495
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,030
you have to bring it to normalcy.

496
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,685
You have to make it a healthy,

497
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:16,008
balanced center,

498
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:22,317
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

499
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:29,626
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

500
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:34,314
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

501
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:37,780
We talk of innocence,

502
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,617
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

503
00:35:40,737 --> 00:35:45,407
we must be on the full watch,

504
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:50,685
on the full alertness about our minds.

505
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,442
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

506
00:35:53,562 --> 00:35:55,785
Where is this thief going?

507
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:58,467
Is he trying to do some tricks?

508
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:02,105
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

509
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:06,055
You have to be alert, very alert.

510
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,574
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

511
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:13,660
But now I have to tell you one thing.

512
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,377
That you'll be exposed.

513
00:36:15,497 --> 00:36:18,167
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

514
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:20,217
She'll expose you.

515
00:36:20,337 --> 00:36:23,194
You'll be exposed

516
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,873
if you try to play tricks with Me.

517
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,513
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

518
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:32,327
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

519
00:36:32,447 --> 00:36:35,057
you'll be exposed.

520
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:38,418
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

521
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:43,472
So please be careful, very careful about it,

522
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:49,836
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

523
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:52,973
and powerful.

524
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:56,398
May God bless you!

525
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,545
So our prayer should be that

526
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:11,635
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

527
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,220
That's all. Let’s pray.

528
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,093
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

529
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:36,306
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

530
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:38,184
Then he will pass it on to you.

531
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:43,945
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

532
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:47,128
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

533
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:51,828
should come and see him every month sometime,

534
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:56,200
and these things should be talked.

535
00:37:58,071 --> 00:38:01,929
Because it's a secret,

536
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,412
not to be discussed openly.

537
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:07,397
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

538
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:11,981
It should not be written down anywhere.

539
00:38:12,101 --> 00:38:14,250
It should not be mentioned,

540
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,814
but should be worked out by all of you,

541
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:23,544
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

542
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,249
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

543
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:33,587
Because men suffer much more than women do.

544
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:39,698
And that's why women must be very careful.

545
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:44,875
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

546
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:56,795
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

547
00:38:56,915 --> 00:39:00,607
men cannot be improved.

548
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:03,943
You have seen in India women don’t like it

549
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:06,345
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

550
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,162
They don't like it.

551
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:11,591
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

552
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:16,115
thousands of them, because they thought some

553
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:20,477
other people may come and touch their body.

554
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:29,378
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

555
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,981
As if it is the body,

556
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:36,342
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

557
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:45,985
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

558
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:49,910
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

559
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,833
the power of their chastity.

560
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:57,165
It's more for ladies here,

561
00:39:57,285 --> 00:40:02,432
that they should try to generate that feeling

562
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:06,168
of nobility, of chastity,

563
00:40:06,288 --> 00:40:08,969
of holiness around them,

564
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:14,373
so that the men themselves respect them

565
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:19,145
and develop that feeling within themselves.

566
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,077
Thank you very much.
