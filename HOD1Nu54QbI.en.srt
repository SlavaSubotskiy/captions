1
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,000
At the very outset we have to know

3
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,060
that truth is what it is.

4
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,100
We cannot conceptualize it,

5
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,660
nor can we organize it,

6
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,680
neither we can order it.

7
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,080
So we have to know it.

8
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,200
I know in Finland, I came here in 1980,

9
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,000
I found people were big seekers, no doubt.

10
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,060
And they are seeking the truth.

11
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
But at the same time you have to know

12
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,960
that truth is a manifestation

13
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,200
on your central nervous system.

14
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,540
Like we have to feel

15
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,680
this all-pervading power

16
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,140
all around us.

17
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,620
You have to feel it on your finger tips.

18
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,800
It's not just what one may claim about,

19
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,400
but it actually has to happen to you.

20
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,920
From ameba stage now we have come to human stage.

21
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
And there is a little breakthrough

22
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,880
which we have to achieve in this lifetime.

23
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
So how do we do it? Many people ask me,

24
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,040
"How do we do it?"

25
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Now, how do we become human beings?

26
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,460
Spontaneously.

27
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,220
Within us is the power, which spontaneously acts.

28
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,580
Because it's a living process.

29
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,840
It is not an artificial process, but a living process.

30
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,340
Like this Mother Earth sprouts a seed,

31
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,680
spontaneously.

32
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,940
Because the Mother Earth has got the capacity,

33
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,520
while the seed has got built-in properties.

34
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,020
In the same way, within us is also built-in this instrument.

35
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Now, you have to have an open mind of a scientist,

36
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,340
that you should see for yourself it works or not.

37
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,680
There should not be any blind faith

38
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,600
about me or about anything.

39
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,300
We have lived with concept, all throughout.

40
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,180
Some people believe into this, some people believe into that,

41
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,500
some people believe into that.

42
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,560
So this belief has led you nowhere.

43
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,860
Whatever belief you may have,

44
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,780
whatever religion you may follow,

45
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,500
whatever philosophies you may follow,

46
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,940
every human being is capable of committing any sin.

47
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:21,160
So, as we are ourselves, we are miraculous things.

48
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,160
Look at the eyes; are best camera also you could ever think of!

49
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,840
Look at our brain, what we have created out of it!

50
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,240
Look at our hands!

51
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,660
All this is a miracle.

52
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,000
And look at the flowers.

53
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,240
These are so beautiful, coming out of a seed.

54
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,160
Who does this work?

55
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
Who does all the living work?

56
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,180
It is done by the all-pervading power,

57
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,780
which is a subtle power of God's love.

58
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,580
In the modern times, if you take the name of God in the West,

59
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,940
people don't like it.

60
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,040
They also conceptualize by saying, "We don't believe in God."

61
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,880
But this is very unscientific.

62
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,760
You should find out, first of all, if there is God or not.

63
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,480
Without finding out any facts,

64
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,220
if you say there is nothing like God,

65
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,980
then you are outside of it.

66
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,900
Now, if I say that there is God

67
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
and there is the all-pervading power of God Almighty,

68
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,200
which does all the subtle work,

69
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,680
then as a scientist you take it as a hypothesis.

70
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,020
And if it is proved, you have to accept it.

71
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,220
So as it is the living process, you can't pay for it.

72
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,020
Those people who take money from you for doing anything

73
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,080
that is called as God's work,

74
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,980
or increasing your awareness,

75
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,480
are all false people.

76
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,940
There are some who will say that, "You can fly in the air."

77
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,060
But we are flying in the air systematically.

78
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,860
But if you just take that some of you just start flying half way in the air,

79
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,380
what will happen?

80
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,800
If you people start just flying half way, you see,

81
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,420
in somewhere, not systematically.

82
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,020
Is that what is going to happen to us,

83
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,000
that we are going to become birds or what?

84
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,480
Then some people say that, "You start jumping like a frog."

85
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,400
Are we going to become like frogs or earthworms now?

86
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,000
What is going to happen to us

87
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,800
is that we are going to become people of absolute truth.

88
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,060
Absolutely righteous.

89
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,580
Absolutely compassionate.

90
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,320
Absolutely loving.

91
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,760
Moreover, we are going to have

92
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,640
the dynamics of truth.

93
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,320
Like Christ, when he saw Mary Magdalene;

94
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,860
he had nothing to do with the prostitute,

95
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,740
just stood up and said,

96
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,260
"Those who have not done any sin

97
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,800
can throw the stone at Me."

98
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,420
That is the courage, that is the courage

99
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,220
of a person who knows the absolute.

100
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,720
While we live in a relative world.

101
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,440
We don't know which theory is correct.

102
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,620
It's all the mental projection.

103
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,800
And nowadays people have become so much mental

104
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,360
that I don't know, how will they recognize the truth?

105
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,040
Because the mental projection moves in a linear way,

106
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,540
it cannot sustain itself, because it's not the truth.

107
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,320
It cannot sustain itself.

108
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,120
So it recoils.

109
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,100
We had science,

110
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,580
so we produced ultimately going to the extremes

111
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,960
atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, this bomb, that bomb

112
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,520
for our destruction.

113
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,960
We started cutting the trees, so ecological problem has come.

114
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,980
We started using the machines, now become slaves of machines.

115
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,960
Machines are for us, we are not for machines!

116
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
So there is no balance in our life.

117
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,020
Anything we start, we would start going to the extremes.

118
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,640
And then we feel guilty.

119
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,440
We think, "Oh, we have done something wrong."

120
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,520
So, one side we start using our ego too much

121
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,740
and then we feel guilty, "we should not have done like that."

122
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,440
So the knowledge that you have about science,

123
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,460
about all other things, is the knowledge of the tree.

124
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,960
But this is the knowledge of your roots.

125
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,840
The tree that grows out of proportion

126
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,560
without having relationship with the roots

127
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,320
is definitely going to be destroyed.

128
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,480
So through Sahaja yoga,

129
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,480
sahaja, 'sahaj' means 'born with you', is 'spontaneous'.

130
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,940
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

131
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,500
So this Sahaja yoga is a right of every human being.

132
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
This is the last breakthrough, as I told you,

133
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,200
of our evolutionary process.

134
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,460
As a result of that you get powers, you become powerful.

135
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,380
You do not become somebody's slave, but you become powerful.

136
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,620
You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

137
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
which is the all-pervading power.

138
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,860
And you get the experience of actualization

139
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,940
of your second birth,

140
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,520
which we can say an actualization of a baptism.

141
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,700
You feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

142
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,580
You feel it!

143
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,840
Then you start understanding your own centers

144
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,760
which are within you, and also the centers that belong to others.

145
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,820
It is like this instrument (mike with wire)

146
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,460
if it is not connected to the means, it has no meaning.

147
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,440
In the same way, our lives have no meaning

148
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,680
unless and until we are connected to this

149
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,680
all-pervading power, which has created us.

150
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,380
I mean of course, as a result of that

151
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,580
so many diseases get cured completely.

152
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,360
We have records and records and records

153
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,340
of so many diseases like breast cancer, another,

154
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,660
so many incurable diseases being cured.

155
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,740
It happens automatically.

156
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,360
You yourself become a doctor.

157
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,180
Because you can feel the diseases of another person

158
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,400
on your fingertips. And if you know, how to correct them,

159
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,820
you are a doctor!

160
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,680
Mentally you become so peaceful.

161
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,200
You feel such joy and such a peace within yourself.

162
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,720
In Helsinki, there is a big talk of peace.

163
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,180
Because, I think, for the safety we have.

164
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,300
(For translator:) Big talk of peace in Helsinki.

165
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,280
And this peace, as there are Peace Foundations,

166
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,600
'peace' this thing, 'peace' that, but nobody has peace within.

167
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,440
So, you establish your peace within yourself.

168
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
But such a person is so compassionate,

169
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,100
at the same time so dynamic,

170
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,660
that you work

171
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,040
any length of time, you are not tired.

172
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,500
You're always feeling fresh

173
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,000
and you give joy to others.

174
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,180
The first thing that happens to you, that you become

175
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,840
an innocent person.

176
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,600
And you develop respect for yourself,

177
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,560
because you know you your glory.

178
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,480
You realize you are at the epitome of evolution.

179
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,240
You no more feel guilty,

180
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,740
because you are now one with that Divine power,

181
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,020
which is the source of all these things.

182
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,100
But your attention

183
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,620
become so innocent and so powerful.

184
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,540
What Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

185
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,000
Your eyes become completely devoid of lust and greed.

186
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,120
And even one glance of such a person

187
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,640
can solve the problem

188
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,820
of anybody in trouble or distress.

189
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,260
So this transformation takes place spontaneously.

190
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,740
But one has to open the mind.

191
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,660
And to recognize that your are all capable

192
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,280
of reaching that state.

193
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,440
Also one thing I've noticed

194
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,920
about, specially about Finland

195
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,380
was that people were very simple

196
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,520
and very humble.

197
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,000
But unnecessarily they felt too much guilty.

198
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,160
They have done nothing wrong so far,

199
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,520
they've never dominated any country

200
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,600
and I don't know why they are (feel) so guilty;

201
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,440
to such an extend that they are very frightened also, afraid.

202
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,860
But there is nothing to be afraid.

203
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,840
If you are in the collective consciousness,

204
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,280
then every nation is your friend.

205
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Like this hand will always help this hand.

206
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,240
Because you are part and parcel of the whole.

207
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,920
You are not hanging somewhere in the air.

208
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,340
Today you will be amazed to know that

209
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,760
for Helsinki we have got people from many different countries,

210
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,560
rushing about, even, even from New Zealand.

211
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,140
And Sahaja yoga is now working in thirty nations.

212
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,680
And you should see the way they all are together,

213
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,420
no quarreling, no fighting, no arguments.

214
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,660
Just enjoying each other.

215
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,820
More than flowers;

216
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,680
more than flowers, more than paintings,

217
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,580
more than anything else

218
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,040
the best things to enjoy are human beings.

219
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,020
But we have to develop that capacity, that state.

220
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,540
I am sorry I am here only for one day,

221
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,920
I wish I had come yesterday

222
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,000
and I am very sorry that I did not come yesterday.

223
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,700
Only thing I have to make a humble request to you all,

224
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,600
that when you get your realization,

225
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,020
don't get lost.

226
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,920
I'll give you an analogy.

227
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,860
Somebody is standing with a snake in his hand

228
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,840
and you tell that person, "There is a snake in your hand."

229
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,640
But he is in darkness.

230
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,660
So, you put on the lights.

231
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,000
He sees the lights

232
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,240
and then he sees the snake

233
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,660
and he is frightened.

234
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,820
He throws away the snake, alright,

235
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,100
but also puts off the light.

236
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,460
Because he is frightened.

237
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,020
That happens very much.

238
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,940
There's nothing to be frightened.

239
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,820
You must know

240
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,280
that all these things which frighten you

241
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,820
will just run away.

242
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,340
But you have to stand on your legs.

243
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,960
So far we have had thousands and thousands of people,

244
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,760
in the West also,

245
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,740
who have got their Realization. They had no problems.

246
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,980
Also I would say that in India, say, when I go there,

247
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,940
we have fifteen thousand people in the meeting.

248
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,740
We have eternal football grounds, you see.

249
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,040
Because we have a background.

250
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,640
And the false gurus are not interested in Indians,

251
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,960
because they have not so much money to waste.

252
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,880
And Indians know that you are not to pay to anyone

253
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,500
who says that "I am such and such."

254
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,400
So it works much faster there.

255
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,540
But in the West those sahaja yogis we have got

256
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,860
are excellent people, very deep.

257
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,520
Quantity is less but quality is great.

258
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,080
I hope today it will work out among you people

259
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,400
and then you are going to master it.

260
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,460
This will hardly take a month at the most.

261
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,260
But you must have determination

262
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,320
that you are going to master this.

263
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,020
I'll give you another analogy that when you start driving the car,

264
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,380
there is a break and an accelerator, you use both.

265
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,020
As the left and the right sympathetic nervous system

266
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,000
as you have seen. (pointing to chart)

267
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,960
But once you learn the balancing,

268
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,880
you become automatically a driver.

269
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,080
But still the master is sitting behind.

270
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,860
So you have to become the master.

271
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,300
And once you become the master, you can see the driver,

272
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,260
the accelerator and the break. And you control it fully.

273
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,740
All this may sound very fantastic.

274
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
But you are fantastic.

275
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,180
You are not yet aware of it.

276
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,660
Like if you take a television in Indian village

277
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,320
and tell them that, "You can see everything in this box."

278
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,600
They will say, "What, this box, how can you see everything?"

279
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,400
But if you put to the mains then they will see what the (connectivity?) it is.

280
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,420
So in our ignorance about ourselves, we might not think much about ourselves.

281
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,900
But each one of you is capable of achieving that state.

282
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,780
So you have to have confidence in yourself.

283
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,340
May God bless you all!

284
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,280
It's a very vast ocean of knowledge

285
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:36,520
and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures

286
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,160
even in English language.

287
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,320
Like for these beautiful lights

288
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,120
we have to just switch on one switch.

289
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,680
But if I go on telling all about electricity

290
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,260
and how it was (told?) and how it started in Finland,

291
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,840
you will have a headache.

292
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,100
Better thing is to have the light!

293
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,440
In any case,

294
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,380
I think because I am here for one day,

295
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,100
if you have any questions you please ask me.

296
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,620
But they should be relatively sensible,

297
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,480
in the sense that they should show that

298
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,840
'we want your self-realization.'

299
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,740
So I am not here to ask for anything.

300
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,500
I am just going to give you your own property,

301
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,100
your own powers.

302
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,360
So I am not here for any votes or elections either.

303
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,040
I am sorry I have come to Finland very late.

304
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,040
But it's the end of the lands, so naturally

305
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,080
it took some time for me to come here.

306
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,760
But I must tell you that among all the Scandinavian nations you are the greatest.

307
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,500
I mean spiritually.

308
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,720
And don’t have any inferiority complex in your heads at all.

309
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,040
Doesn't I know Finns very well? (Shri Mataji laughing)

310
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,620
There humility goes up to the inferiority complex.

311
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,700
That's going too far.

312
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,300
You are good for everything!

313
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,920
And specially very good for spiritual ascent!

314
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,380
Alright. Is there a question?

315
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,660
Q. Yes. How can you divide people? For Scandinavian people, for Finnish people, Swedish people?

316
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,900
A. That is an incidence.

317
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,360
Q. How can you make.. how can you make divide?

318
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,380
A. Yes, you can also, once you get this realization, you can also.

319
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,840
Because when you go to a nation, you see a spiritual life,

320
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,840
how many are seeking the divine.

321
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,100
And how do you... how do some people go deep into it

322
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,980
and some people are very superficial.

323
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,360
You can easily see, that say I would say Turkey,

324
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,260
we had such a lot of sahaja yogis suddenly coming up

325
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,620
without any difficulties, Turkey, of all the places.

326
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,400
And they were the people who were told

327
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:24,160
that they will never come to Sahaja Yoga (Turkey people), because they are islamic people.

328
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,140
But they blossomed!

329
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,560
Now, as you know my husband’s job is international;

330
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:45,500
I met many people who are Finn, who are also Swedish and also from Denmark;

331
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,080
but I found the Finn people have a genuine desire to know.

332
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,940
So when I say that, I mean the more percentage of people.

333
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,860
If I say so, Russians will be very great seekers and they will be there very soon.

334
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,320
Imagine their (Russian) Government has accepted Sahaja Yoga officially.

335
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,800
And also Italian Government has accepted in a very big way.

336
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,000
And even if, I mean Indians accept it, I am not surprised

337
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,900
because they know all about it already.

338
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,400
So the quality of spirituality can be determined by the percentage of people

339
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,540
and the depth of the people.

340
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,640
It's easy to ascertain.

341
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,500
It is easy to ascertain them.

342
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,000
Now, let others as the questions. Alright?

343
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,980
He says that if you have some bad habits,
like smoking tobacco,

344
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,180
and you want to grow and try to reach the state of enlightenment,

345
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,100
do you have to leave them before you can have it.

346
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,060
A. You just leave them automatically. I don’t have to tell you.

347
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,860
Once you get your realization.

348
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,980
In England we had drug addicts, overnight they gave up.

349
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,400
Overnight. You won't believe that (unclear).

350
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,400
Because you get the light

351
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,840
and you get the power.

352
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,040
I know there is a drug problem here, I know that very well.

353
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,060
Because you depend on it [drugs] and then suddenly

354
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,220
you start depending on your spirit; the whole thing is finished.

355
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,220
Q. How often?

356
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,900
How do you practice and how often do you practice?

357
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,280
A. You don't need. This is no question of time I mean, my child,

358
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,800
you go beyond time.

359
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,160
It just works.

360
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,040
You see, it's... the Kundalini starts rising,

361
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,960
and she starts enriching your centers by which you start

362
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,720
feeling better and satisfied with yourself.

363
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,380
And in most of the cases it has happened, it has happened overnight.

364
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:22,480
That's why I said the quality of seeking in the West is much better than in India.

365
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,040
Most of the people take to drugs because they are seeking.

366
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:50,160
Most of the people who commit suicide, they are also seeking.

367
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,980
They do it out of frustration.

368
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:06,540
Also in sahaja yoga you will be happy to know that family life becomes beautiful.

369
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,080
Every year we have about 75 marriages

370
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,220
and I would say 1% will be divorced or some sort of thing;

371
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,440
but otherwise they have got very beautiful.

372
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,840
And also they have beautiful children,

373
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,020
just like saints.

374
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,020
Yes, please?

375
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,180
Q. What's the first point about deepening and maintaining the experience,

376
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,740
what is the first point about that, Shri Mataji?

377
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,360
A: Yes. For that I am saying it take about a month,

378
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,400
at the most, to see, because you yourself become knowledgeable.

379
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,800
You yourself know, what's wrong with you.

380
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,600
I will give you an example.

381
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,600
There was a gentleman who came and he said, he is a realized soul,

382
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,320
he said, “Mother my this agya chakra is catching”.

383
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,460
That means his ego is troubling him,

384
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,200
that means he can see his ego, separately.

385
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:16,960
If you tell somebody, "You are suffering from ego", that people will hate you;

386
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:21,040
anybody.

387
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,720
But this person himself says that he has got ego.

388
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:44,080
Now what do I tell him? That you just forgive,

389
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,480
everyone.

390
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,880
And he has those cool vibrations in his hands

391
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,360
and he can correct it. (Shri Mataji pointing at forehead.)

392
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,020
So you have to just know how to correct your damages, that's all.

393
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,460
Which is of course free.

394
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,980
The whole knowledge is absolutely free.

395
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,860
Q. What can you say about... what can you say about wish?

396
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:39,200
Is it if we have not enough... not strong enough wish

397
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,660
to enlightenment, to self-realization.

398
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,380
A: You see, actually this is the point one should know

399
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,600
that we cannot force it on anyone.

400
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,240
Then we cannot force it. That's all.

401
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,500
Just can't force it. We are very sorry.

402
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,220
We can't help people if they don't want to have it.

403
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,820
It cannot be forced.

404
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,980
No, not at all.

405
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,020
And moreover, if you want to leave us, it's alright,

406
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,000
very good, thank you very much.

407
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,340
You see also in the Kingdom of God there isn’t many place, you see.

408
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:15,000
Q. Is it possible to sing or make music which are same as Truth?

409
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:29,620
A. Of course, music is very close to it.

410
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,060
But first you must get your realization.

411
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,640
Then you will have discretion to know, which is the right music

412
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,700
and which is not.
