1
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:13,470
So mainly your attention has to be all right.

2
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:21,423
Attention has to be concentrated upon your Spirit.

3
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:26,930
Then you become the best instrument,

4
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:30,391
your attention very powerful.

5
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:33,855
It’s not… nothing outside.

6
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:39,938
Like, you may think that if you develop a big beard and a moustache

7
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:44,160
and long hair and sit down like Guru Nanaka,

8
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,529
you don’t become Guru Nanaka.

9
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:51,040
It is not outside; it’s the inside state.

10
00:00:51,543 --> 00:00:56,588
The inside state has to be perfected.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,617
I know I am Mahamaya,

12
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:05,680
but you are very lucky people

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,077
because I always remind you I am Mahamaya first of all.

14
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:20,023
And the another point is that you have somebody with you

15
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,922
to tell you and guide you

16
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:28,625
which none of the saints had, none of the Incarnations had,

17
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,890
none of the Prophets had

18
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:36,638
So please take full advantage.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,947
Have full advantage of being My children

20
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:49,163
and bringing more and more seekers to Sahaja Yoga.

21
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:57,519
So today, I would like you to have your awareness of your powers.

22
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,919
You are sitting on top of a mountain,

23
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:05,476
and you are sitting on top of the evolution now.

24
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:09,677
In knowledge, you are the greatest yogis;

25
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:14,019
in power, you are the greatest yogis.

26
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,347
You can become the greatest saints in righteousness and dharma.

27
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:26,597
Where you lack is the dedication and devotion,

28
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:29,220
the pure desire.

29
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,828
Like, these yogis used to go in the jungles,

30
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,360
live there with the wild animals

31
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:47,640
and used to practice meditation to achieve self-realization,

32
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:52,588
years after years, lives after lives,

33
00:02:55,867 --> 00:03:00,465
because they had a pure desire so strong within them.

34
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,666
But in Sahaja Yoga you move one step and you get blessings,

35
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:07,421
you move another step you get another blessing;

36
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:11,249
it is nothing but blessings all the time.

37
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,117
You are blessed every moment.

38
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,236
But sometimes also must know,

39
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:20,042
because of Mahamaya character of your Mother,

40
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:23,668
these blessings are temptations.

41
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:27,238
So be aware of it

42
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:33,847
and try to keep, with humility, yourself in the center.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,680
It’s like ego, you see, because like this air you go up;

44
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:43,408
and like these balloons, any fashion comes in,

45
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,975
you all go in the same direction anywhere it can take you.

46
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,794
But thank God, there is a string which is tied.

47
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:56,536
So, we have to be solid pillars of Sahaja Yoga

48
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:01,283
creating the roof for all the seekers of the world,

49
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,631
for the emancipation of humanity.

50
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,573
Of course, pujas, you know that you go deep.

51
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,994
You go very deep into pujas, you touch very great depths.

52
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:18,137
But that is My doing.

53
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,455
What is your doing is to seek out that depth,

54
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:28,523
keep up the enjoyment of that doing.

55
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,575
May God bless you all.
