1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,845
Evening Program Day 1, Delphi, 1999

2
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:03,040
After such

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,660
beautiful

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,160
divine

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,660
music,

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,280
I don’t know what to say.

7
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,035
The,

8
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:15,355
even the heart of all the Deities

9
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:18,545
must be jumping with joy

10
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,275
as you all were jumping with joy.

11
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,035
It’s such a unison,

12
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:25,115
the oneness

13
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,105
with all the musicians

14
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:31,015
and the celestial musicians it was.

15
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:34,635
It was really a tremendous

16
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,635
experience of joy.

17
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,525
 

18
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:40,835
I must thank

19
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:42,945
the people who have come

20
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:46,085
all the way from Benin,

21
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:50,155
they did so well, I mean, I just don’t know

22
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:53,915
how rhythmically they always

23
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:56,645
have been dancing.

24
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:58,185
And in something in them,

25
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,365
in the African people I’ve seen,

26
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,725
they have

27
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:05,165
such a lot of rhythm,

28
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:08,865
all the time they are rhythmic:

29
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,740
they’ll walk rhythmically, they’ll talk rhythmically.

30
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,140
It’s sort of- I think sometimes –

31
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:14,475
"Ke"

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,500
Shri Shiva is acting through them.

33
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,880
All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,960
and the way they change it, make it patterns,

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,480
and double it, triple it

36
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,980
and suddenly new patterns come out.

37
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,480
 

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,040
[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don’t know.

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,480
Other country?

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,140
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,160
Then comes Ivory Cost.

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,620
And the people of Ivory Coast are also very remarkable.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,120
 

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
I was surprised the way

46
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,195
the ladies also were dancing

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
absolutely full of, full of rhythm.

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,660
I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them.

49
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:06,620
That is something so important to understand

50
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,760
and

51
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,260
 

52
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,100
to enjoy music

53
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,620
and to enjoy Sahaj.

54
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,840
You see, it's like a-

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,020
I see so many lights there

56
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,860
as if I felt you all got the lights in your throat, in your eyes,

57
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,580
also in your Sahasrara.

58
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,080
 

59
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:30,775
It was a wonderful time.

60
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,320
So we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us

61
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,800
and to make us enjoy everything.

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,120
So we have to be very thankful.

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,620
 

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,240
And how, see, so much far away they are otherwise,

65
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,660
but how they have become so much one with us.

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,160
 

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,620
We must thank the French for this, that they went

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,500
 

69
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
and governed those countries.

70
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,860
By their governing them, they came close to us!

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,600
If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon.

72
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,560
 

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,160
So it’s such a beautiful combination, oneness

74
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,300
with all of us

75
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,480
and I must thank you again and again.

76
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Then we have another little thing

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,080
which is very important at least to do.

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,740
I’ve seen now such a genius,

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,400
there is one genius born

80
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,680
and he must be a great musician in his last life

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,720
I’m sure!

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,260
The way he handles the violin,

83
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,640
I can’t believe it.

84
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,220
But [unsure] he can play without notations or without something, is a miracle.

85
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,720
 

86
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,340
And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself

87
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,460
is a miracle

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,860
And then he took to Indian classical music,

89
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,960
he was playing

90
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,760
very deftly, absolutely so well,

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
I was amazed how a talented person like him

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,300
can take to any kind of music.

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,800
 

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,520
And Babamama has already told Me that: “Your Sahaja Yogis are really talented.

95
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,020
 

96
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,840
They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult,

97
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,100
classical, Indian music?

98
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,040
Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it.”

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,540
 

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,740
Now, we had on tabla another French man

101
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,680
whom I had not seen for the last - I think-  three, four years,

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,180
 

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,500
but I think now he has mastered it.

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,480
The way he plays is really very remarkable.

105
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,195
I was surprised how he could play.

106
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,460
And then is this gentleman who played ” [raag] Malkans” to you.

107
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,320
It’s a very difficult raga.

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,860
In that one swara, we call them “madewa”,

109
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,360
 

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,400
that is being taken away from the main team [range]

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,060
and also the - I don’t know English word –

112
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,180
the “pa” [sol] is also removed.

113
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,680
 

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,300
It’s a very difficult, very melodious and not easily

115
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,540
 

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,340
learnt his Malkans raag.

117
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,340
I’m surprised how these people in such a short time

118
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,460
have mastered such a difficult raga

119
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:18,960
 

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,580
for which in India, Indians, have to work years together!

121
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,175
But you, being even not Indian,

122
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,760
you have never heard these notes

123
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,340
and how you have achieved this mastery is beyond Me.

124
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,700
It’s a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is

125
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,280
that it has given you rhythm,

126
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,540
it has given you “swarasasana”, means the notes.

127
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,780
You are not weaving out from the notes.

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,540
I’m not myself,  I myself

129
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,040
don’t sing myself,

130
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,900
I used to once upon a time

131
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,360
but my family is so much in music that it has gone into my heart, into my mind.

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,860
 

133
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,980
And when I see this, I say: “Look at that!

134
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,500
How these people have come out!”

135
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,120
 

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,880
The last but not the least is this lady, Ana.

137
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,080
Sahaja Yogini: Anne.

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Who is another master.

139
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,860
Well, they're all masters can you imagine?

140
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,480
This little boy is already a master.

141
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,540
But the ways he's accompanying Indian music, I mean,

142
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,460
I’m amazed at him.

143
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,840
In the same way, this lady the way she was rendering very difficult ragas,

144
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,180
 

145
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,280
with such deftness with such perfection.

146
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,780
 

147
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,660
I mean, I'm going to now take this film to India.

148
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,160
 

149
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,560
They have been asking Me: “Mother why don’t you give your episodes, your programs to us.

150
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,060
 

151
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,780
We’d like to broadcast it from the Television.”

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,480
Now I’ll say: “Look at this, you see this,

153
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,920
And they will all jump at it I tell you.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
They will have it and they will do it

155
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,020
and they’ll be so amazed that how could, with Sahaja Yoga, you could master these things.

156
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,520
 

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
And see the oneness of us.

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,420
You are from this country you are from that country,

159
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,360
and also speak different languages

160
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,860
 

161
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,620
and you understand different words,

162
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,120
everything differently.

163
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,820
But when it comes to Sahaja bhajans,

164
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,460
I don’t know how you get completely one with it.

165
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,300
That shows that Sahaja Yoga is going to bring the whole world together

166
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,760
through its music and through

167
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,260
 

168
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,060
its manifestation.

169
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,280
I am really very much honoured, I am thankful to all the artists,

170
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,220
all of you

171
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,700
for such beautiful rendering.

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,420
For all the ladies who have come here, I wish I was young to learn their dancing.

173
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,300
But I’m not.

174
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,540
Also,  I used to sing very well

175
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,840
But because of lecturing and all that I think I’ve lost that capacity to sing.

176
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,340
 

177
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,580
Now you see, after you see this, it’s like a reflection of your heart,

178
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,240
 

179
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,980
it’s the reflection of your ideas about your ideal, your visions.

180
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,000
You see this world singing together the song of Divinity.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,940
 

182
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,960
It’s something nobody would believe, that we have such a good group of people here.

183
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,775
 

184
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,740
I’m thankful to you all and to the audience

185
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,200
who have joined and have shown their beautiful

186
