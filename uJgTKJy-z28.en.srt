1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,840
I’m very joyous today

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,800
to see all of you celebrating My Birthday,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,000
as well as having the

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,820
national program same day.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,820
It’s a good combination we have, in the month of March.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,950
Is regarded as springtime in India – Madhumas,

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,030
that’s what you sing, Madhumas.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,800
And as you know, twenty-first March is the equinox,

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,040
so it sort of is a balance,

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,020
and also the center of all the

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,040
signs you have in the horoscope.

12
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,010
So many centers I had to achieve,

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,830
and also I was born on

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,930
the Tropic of Cancer

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,860
as you are on the Tropic of Capricorn,

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,800
and Ayers Rock is on the Tropic of Capricorn,

17
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,940
just in the center.

18
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,010
So many combinations had to be worked out.

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,970
So the principle of ascent

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,890
is to be in the center,

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
to be in the balance,

22
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,000
to be in the maryadas of the center.

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,820
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,010
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,010
to the maryadas?

26
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,810
Then we get caught up.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,900
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,940
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,010
Say we have the maryadas,

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,820
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

31
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,830
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,930
on all the sides of the void,

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,030
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,910
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

35
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,820
and to keep to the boundaries is difficult

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,950
when you have two problems:

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,910
one is the ego, another is the superego.

38
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,040
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

39
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,980
Ego is the problem, and it has very,

40
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,920
very subtle implications now,

41
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,980
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

42
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,020
One is a gross,

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,920
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

44
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,020
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,990
That one is the one,

46
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,970
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

47
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,860
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,820
then he behaves in this manner,

49
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,850
only that he doesn’t know

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,970
how to hide his ego in sophistication.

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,040
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

52
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,880
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

53
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,950
Like in English language we’ll say,

54
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,870
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,840
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,800
It’s such a devious thing,

57
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,800
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

58
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,970
that means you have put a chocolate

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,880
on top of that, isn’t it?

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,820
Such a camouflage, must understand.

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,820
See we must face as we are,

62
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,870
we cannot be facing something else.

63
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,850
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,860
that we avoid facing ourselves.

65
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,930
Today though the day is of celebration

66
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,000
so in all humor we should understand

67
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,820
what this stupid thing called ego is.

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,870
In all humor, not in seriousness,

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,800
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,800
Now as I was explaining in the morning

71
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,040
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,970
I mean even before going to the hall,

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,940
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

74
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,800
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

75
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,930
I mean all the time it has been there

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,980
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,980
It has never vanished.

78
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
So this chakra is all the time working,

79
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,950
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

80
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,960
So what happens really,

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,890
we should see the physical side of it,

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,980
it’s very important to understand.

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,840
You see from childhood if we are taught

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,990
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

85
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,880
you have to achieve something,

86
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,860
some success or this and that,

87
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,830
then the idea of strength is given to you,

88
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,950
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,860
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

90
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,910
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,820
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,860
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

93
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,860
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,930
You can never be successful if you do like that.

95
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,990
So unless and until you are possessed

96
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,850
you can never be obedient.

97
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,820
This is what it is.

98
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Somebody has to possess you,

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,920
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

100
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,000
then you can be obedient;

101
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,900
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

102
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,830
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

103
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,040
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

104
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,030
everybody wants to have their own way,

105
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,840
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

106
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,960
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

107
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,840
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

108
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,860
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

109
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,810
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

110
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,020
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

111
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,800
they become disobedient.

112
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,990
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

113
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,960
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,880
obedience is weakness.

115
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,990
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

116
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,860
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

117
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,030
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

118
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,980
and all those things it does burst,

119
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,900
but it is flexible also.

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,930
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

121
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,830
superego, then the superego

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,030
can go up to a point, it is also there.

123
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,990
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

124
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,930
drugs just to push it back

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,940
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

126
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,980
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

127
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,940
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

128
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,970
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

129
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,980
Otherwise ego is too much.

130
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,850
So when somebody says something to you,

131
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,870
instead of facing up to it

132
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,880
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

133
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,820
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

134
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,810
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

135
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,880
Because there’s another place

136
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,870
where this ego can go is when you come round,

137
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,850
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

138
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,000
so when it is suppressed from the other side

139
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,990
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

140
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,940
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

141
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,800
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

142
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,810
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

143
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,860
and that’s how you sulk and think.

144
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,800
Think so you get more ego,

145
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,850
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

146
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,930
Now, the practical way

147
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,950
the central path is established by being in reality.

148
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,860
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

149
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,950
Supposing something has gone wrong,

150
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,880
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

151
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
because I’ve done the mistake.

152
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
All right, why did I do the mistake?

153
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,040
Because of this, so next time no.”

154
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,880
But very easy, avoid everything,

155
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,960
come to this and enjoy your ego feeling sad.

156
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,880
Is an indulgence.

157
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,960
And others also feel, “Oh, he’s felt

158
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,860
‘I’m sorry I’ve killed you,’ you see.

159
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,910
He feels sorry for it.”

160
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,860
Yes I’ve seen, it is gone so far

161
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,960
in the minds of the Western people

162
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,000
that there are laws which really forgive people

163
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,850
who should never be forgiven.

164
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,860
They also try to forgive people

165
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,910
because of this left nonsensical Vishuddhi

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,030
which indulges into the left side,

167
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,820
you feel sympathy for such people,

168
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,980
who should not have been forgiven.

169
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,040
Like there’s one fellow who has murdered so many people,

170
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,040
put them into gas chambers, this thing.

171
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,020
He’s arrested now, he’s a liability now,

172
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,880
big liability as a prisoner kept somewhere

173
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,990
because they had to keep everything very much closed,

174
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,040
and this and that.

175
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,940
So to maintain such a dog there

176
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,800
was very difficult for English people,

177
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,810
but they are maintaining this one prisoner.

178
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,030
I’ve forgotten his name, horrible fellow whosoever it is.

179
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,850
Now he has been there, he’s old, this thing

180
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,920
- let him die there, what is there to have pity?

181
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,900
Just hang him out and finish. He has killed so many people.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,930
No, but how can you do that.

183
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,980
You must keep this doggy there

184
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,830
though he’s consuming the money of all the people,

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,010
though he has killed thousands and thousands

186
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,860
and thousands in gas chamber.

187
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,890
He’s been such a horrid fellow there should be no sympathy,

188
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,910
in the Divine Laws he would be finished in no time.

189
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,920
He’s dissipating every day,

190
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,820
but even now I read articles in sympathy with him.

191
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,920
“Now what is he going to do wrong? Why not leave him alone?”

192
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,920
This is how you play in to the hands

193
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,830
of horrible people by your Left Vishuddhi, first of all.

194
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,980
So this Left Vishuddhi is nothing but purely,

195
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,940
purely ego and then you bend your head like that,

196
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,890
you walk like this.

197
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,990
Now with this Left Vishuddhi though you have many,

198
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,850
many physical problems,

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,970
but the worst of all will be lunacy.

200
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,800
The other day somebody told Me that

201
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,800
at the age of forty years now in America,

202
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,990
people are suddenly becoming lunatic

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,830
and it’s a very big sickness,

204
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,860
just like they have it in

205
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,880
that horrible disease called AIDS,

206
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,990
in that way it is spreading.

207
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,000
Now I must tell you as your Mother, very clearly,

208
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,890
that this is the part this horrible Left Vishuddhi plays.

209
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,880
Do not indulge into it.

210
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,840
If you have an ego, that’s why it’s Left Vishuddhi,

211
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,940
face up to yourself.

212
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,930
Like today Warren’s idea was that he came and told Me that

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,880
“In India when we go, we think that

214
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,810
the people whatever we suggest first start with ‘No, no.’ ”

215
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,810
So you see actually that “No, no,”

216
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,850
is because we are brought up a different way,

217
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,880
you see - to face up to it, we are brought up to it.

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,850
That’s why Indians are never guilty.

219
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,030
If they are guilty know that they are westernized.

220
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,890
They’re never guilty.

221
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,020
So now at that time when they say, “No” to something,

222
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,020
ninety nine percent, not the people who are in the cities,

223
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,820
they are same style of (?)

224
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,010
because you have blessed them nicely, but in the villages.

225
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,890
You see they tell themselves,

226
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,020
“No, no, how I could have done it?

227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,960
All right, if I have done it I better correct it.”

228
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,890
“No, no,” it starts with “No, no.”

229
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,870
But a Western person might hear this “No, no”

230
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,980
and he’ll think, “He’s just punching my ego.”

231
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,970
Because still that ego is there to dominate others,

232
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,820
still this ego thinks they are much better organizers,

233
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,800
still this one thinks they are cleaner people than others,

234
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,940
they are higher people than others.

235
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,930
All this ego thinks like that, you see,

236
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,840
and builds you up and you live on top, you see,

237
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,850
like a balloon or a ring that is bloated

238
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,830
you keep on the surface,

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,840
and that’s why don’t want the air to get out,

240
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,020
because you know, you'll sink into yourself.

241
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,860
So one lives on that

242
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,860
and you start thinking you know it better,

243
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,040
anybody says anything to you, one feels hurt,

244
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,030
again Left Vishuddhi.

245
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,950
If Mother says anything, again Left Vishuddhi.

246
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,890
So you have all ready made a pouch there being in the West;

247
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,800
we should face as we are.

248
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,820
Now that pouch is there so anything I say,

249
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,000
now even if I’m saying now, you should not feel guilty.

250
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,000
Let’s see, not feel guilty.

251
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,890
Be on your Spirit so you see yourself

252
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,010
and you can clear out.

253
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,980
If you see from your Spirit’s angle you clear out

254
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,880
that which you have been accumulating since long.

255
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,940
Left Vishuddhi is the problem today of the West I tell you.

256
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,950
All these problems are coming from Left Vishuddhi,

257
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,980
but which is not in no way is that they’re subdued,

258
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,820
on the contrary any moment

259
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,840
this Left Vishuddhi can blow in again into the ego.

260
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,840
You see, I’ve seen this in the West very common,

261
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,030
people are walking straight forward everything is all right.

262
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,910
Even in the cities of India we have seen it

263
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,810
- you make them into trustees,

264
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,950
suddenly they jump on the horse.

265
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,910
I said, “From where did they jump in the horse,

266
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,870
from where did this ego come?”

267
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,040
That was all stored up here you see,

268
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,930
as soon as they become trustees the whole thing comes back

269
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,900
and they are sitting like John Gilpin on a horse

270
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,970
going fast and I start looking at them,

271
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
where are they going?

272
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,930
They were just there, disappeared,

273
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,990
vanishing tricks.

274
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,960
Just can’t understand why it happens.

275
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,870
But after penetrating into the problems,

276
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,910
because I see just going to the hall

277
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,880
you get the Left Vishuddhi.

278
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,020
But look at the children,

279
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,830
you see from childhood you don’t teach them

280
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,800
all the time say, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

281
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,970
Our Parsees in India

282
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,970
have very much affectation from you, very much.

283
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,810
So in the morning we never want to see a Parsee

284
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,870
because early in the morning he’ll come and start saying,

285
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,040
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” This is inauspicious.

286
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,950
“Maafkaro, Maafkaro,” you see people say,

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,040
“Baba, you come in the afternoon, this is not the time,

288
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,900
morning time don’t start with this.”

289
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,830
We don’t say like this, is inauspicious.

290
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,020
You open the door somebody standing,

291
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,990
“Maafkaro,” for what, what have I done?

292
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,030
What have you done that you are saying like this,

293
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,860
all the time in an apologetic mood you see, for what?

294
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,960
You see, you don’t want to see an apologetic face

295
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,810
in the morning time do you?

296
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,810
Something pleasant, nice coming to greet you, here this

297
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,010
“Maafkaro, maafkaro, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

298
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,840
It’s a very common thing

299
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,040
that we don’t want to see a Parsee in the morning,

300
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,800
the reason is this: you see, if you see them in the morning

301
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,940
the whole day you are in a bad state,

302
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,860
you have seen somebody apologetic.

303
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,830
But it is not apology, they are extremely egotistical people.

304
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,970
If you study their character, they’re very egotistical.

305
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,890
So this one has to understand:

306
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,810
that when we start dealing with our ego

307
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,820
we, must directly deal with it.

308
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,950
We are not ego, we are the Spirit. Directly.

309
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,830
“Oh I see. So it was wrong, so it was done by not me,

310
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,880
by this body, now come along, no, no, better be all right.”

311
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,900
You tell yourself, “No, no better be all right.”

312
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,030
That’s how we are going to deal with it,

313
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,000
because you see this is what is frightening Me

314
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,960
is this Left Vishuddhi.

315
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Because when I thought of this disease,

316
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,870
My attention went to Left Vishuddhi.

317
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,830
Imagine people becoming lunatic.

318
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,870
And most of the egotistical people I find

319
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,030
become stupid because of that.

320
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,800
They are stupid, they behave stupidly, they behave stupidly.

321
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,830
And the egotistical people only take to drugs

322
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,000
and to drink so much because they can stand it.

323
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,970
Supposing a person who is very superego,

324
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,880
supposing a man who is possessed takes to drinks,

325
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,870
he’ll die very soon, he won’t live

326
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,990
because he’s thrown more that side.

327
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,890
But the egotistical people can stand, I mean,

328
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
a person who is not egotistical, like an Indian

329
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,000
if he takes a vodka he’ll be blown off the shores,

330
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,810
absolutely, nowhere to be found, lost.

331
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,870
Even in lost and found he won’t be there.

332
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,990
But it’s that ego of yours that has resistance

333
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
for the superego

334
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,920
and that’s how you manage it.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,810
You see that’s why people can drink,

336
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,040
it has nothing to do with the cold weather or anything

337
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,880
it’s more your ego.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,940
Now when you call also left sided

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,820
sometimes you make a big mistake.

340
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,920
You are not.

341
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,960
You live with that myth

342
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,890
because that’s how you can excuse your ego.

343
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,950
Because basically Western people are egotistical.

344
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,810
We must accept this fact.

345
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,980
We are not Western people, we belong to the realm of God,

346
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,880
so don’t feel guilty.

347
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,920
You are no more Western, to Me you are neither Indian,

348
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,030
nor English nor Australians, you are My children.

349
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,980
But some of these things are hanging around,

350
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,010
so you be careful what I am telling you,

351
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,850
this will happen to all of you in a little way but not much.

352
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,890
So be careful, it is outside,

353
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,980
outside the mariadas where you little bit get out, you find.

354
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,970
So those who think also who are left-sided,

355
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,900
are only possessed people, because they’re possessed,

356
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,920
that’s why they become left-sided,

357
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,010
otherwise they’re not, by temperament they’re not,

358
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,910
because there’s no tradition,

359
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,990
there’s no conditioning accepted, nothing,

360
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,960
there has been no conditioning on them of any kind.

361
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,890
So there are hardly to be found any tamasikas in the West,

362
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,960
hardly to be found.

363
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,910
So what do we have are the people

364
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,900
who are egotistical but get possessed.

365
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,890
So these possessions take charge of your ego,

366
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,010
and they work through your ego,

367
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,840
so they are much more dangerous than the ordinary tamasikas.

368
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,990
You see an ordinary tamasikas who even gets possessed,

369
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,840
he dies very soon; otherwise he just, he troubles himself.

370
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,890
He gets body pains, he gets all those troubles himself.

371
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,020
But when a person who is egoistical is also possessed,

372
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,900
then he becomes a troublesome person.

373
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,820
In India if people drink you’ll be surprised

374
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,980
they become very nice people, extremely mild,

375
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,830
very quiet, very good.

376
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,830
I mean some women told Me,

377
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,900
“We want them to drink because they’re better.”

378
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,800
But not here, they become violent, why?

379
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,980
Because there is already the base for the ego

380
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,960
and these fellows who jump in from the left side

381
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,930
or right side whatever it is take over the ego.

382
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,960
And they work through the ego then,

383
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,020
so such people become cruel, assertive.

384
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,990
I mean, all Germans were dealt like that.

385
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,960
They were all possessed by supraconscious bhoots

386
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,810
and they all behaved in this atrocious manner.

387
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,870
Imagine any human being, human being,

388
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,920
killing millions of people with the gas chamber.

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,960
Can you think of it?

390
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,010
I mean, you can’t even see

391
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,000
a little chicken being cut in your presence.

392
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,880
How can you see so many people just there,

393
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,800
being gassed before you,

394
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,820
trying to get out of the gas chambers?

395
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,840
And they were all transparent so you could see them.

396
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,820
See the cruelty to which they could go. How?

397
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,980
They were possessed, and possessed by egoistical temperament.

398
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,020
So these bhoots also used their ego and did it.

399
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,990
So we are in the center,

400
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,970
we are the people who have ascended to God’s level;

401
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,970
we have no business to have Left Vishuddhi on any point.

402
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,940
We have no ego. Where is the ego? It’s finished.

403
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,900
Where is the superego? Finished.

404
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,920
So if there is even a lurking thing of that,

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,960
you just face up to it. Why do you feel guilty?

406
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,930
For what?

407
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,900
Nonsense?

408
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,940
And that’s how you get rid of it.

409
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,000
Because I have seen with Sahaja Yogis also

410
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,890
suddenly their nose will blow out, their eyes will come out,

411
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,810
suddenly they’ll talk like this and I get a fright.

412
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,960
I said, “What’s the matter? He was a normal person,

413
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,850
why is he talking like this now?”

414
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,940
The reason is that hidden ego suddenly jumps out and shows.

415
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,820
It’s with many Indians also,

416
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,890
those who are city dwellers are horribly egoistical,

417
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,810
you have blessed them, as I told you,

418
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,980
so they also behave in the same manner.

419
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,920
But because there is tradition of keeping in the center

420
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,830
in any country, like China has the same.

421
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,870
I’ve seen, China has the same.

422
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,890
I haven’t seen they ever say,

423
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,900
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

424
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,030
And they don’t even discuss.

425
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,870
The Russians have been so bad to them.

426
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,960
“It’s all right,” we tell them. We ask them,

427
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,800
“Why did you cut off from the Russians?” “Forget it.”

428
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,800
They never criticize, sit down and criticize,

429
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,910
“They did like this,” or sulk about it or think about, nothing.

430
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,040
Like Indians, now you will be surprised,

431
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,870
we have a law that we are not supposed

432
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,010
to make any films against the English. Can you imagine?

433
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,920
Because they left our country in grace.

434
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,850
Even Shivaji’s pictures are not allowed

435
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,870
because maybe it will show that the Muslims are bad,

436
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,860
to that extent we go.

437
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,920
Because forget it, forget it, forget it,

438
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,990
when you start thinking about that person,

439
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,870
your ego gets hit.

440
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,890
It is an ego which is hurt,

441
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,870
now you can blow this

442
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,980
balloon by two methods, perhaps you know that,

443
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,980
by blowing into it or removing all the air from outside,

444
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,870
or even by hitting.

445
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,960
So the hurt ego is where the outside

446
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,010
is getting vacated and the balloon is increasing,

447
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,010
and the other ego, pumped up ego,

448
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
is that when the balloon is filled with that air.

449
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,990
Both things are just the same;

450
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,040
I mean the result is the same

451
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,880
whether you do it this way or that way.

452
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,960
So once you understand the physical manifestation of this,

453
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,020
not only that you develop all these diseases but also

454
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,940
develop a thing called lunacy at a very, very young age,

455
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,930
because you don’t know how to cope with yourself.

456
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,960
So the best way is to, if you have done something,

457
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,840
forgive yourself at that point,

458
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,860
“I forgive myself at this point, all right.

459
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,900
And that this was done because of this - all right,

460
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,850
so I should not have done this.

461
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,990
Never I’m not going to do it again,”

462
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,000
Just say like that, just absolutely neutralize.

463
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,970
Unless and until you neutralize it,

464
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,950
you again store it up there, that’s the point is.

465
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:47,030
Secondly I have to tell you that the women in the West

466
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,910
have changed their styles, which is very, very dangerous

467
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,980
for their society, because they have also taken

468
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,840
to the egoistical ways of men.

469
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,950
So if men have gone say ten feet

470
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,970
they have run after them again,

471
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:08,000
about say eight feet and pulled back men

472
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,010
even to go further than them.

473
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,800
Now this is completely crossing your egos,

474
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,830
because women do not have such possibility of egos normally.

475
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,810
So competing men in ego what you did

476
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,880
you have lost your complete mariadas of a woman,

477
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,930
there’s no mariada of a woman.

478
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,030
Man has a mariada of a man;

479
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,980
if a man starts behaving like a woman, he’s not a man.

480
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,990
In the same way, the women, if they start behaving like men,

481
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,010
then they are no more women. They lost their mariadas.

482
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,040
They’re out, so they get possessed.

483
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,800
And that’s why women, when they are egoistical

484
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,860
they become horrid,

485
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,020
their faces become horrid, they look horrid,

486
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,030
their whole behavior is horrid.

487
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,910
They can become dry like bean sticks you see,

488
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,800
and could be so hard as to hit you like an iron rod.

489
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,890
They say, “The lady with the iron rod in her hand.”

490
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,800
All this happens because we have a mariada,

491
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,840
we are the style as we are.

492
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,010
If it’s a rose, it’s a rose.

493
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,850
Be happy that you are a flower of rose.

494
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,900
Now the rose wants to become the thorn,

495
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,840
so we lose all our mariadas.

496
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,890
Today I will be speaking to you before we start this

497
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,010
here when the people are coming before that,

498
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,020
to the ladies and tell them what’s gone wrong with them,

499
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,810
and that is how you must know that the plight

500
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,950
of the West is not by men, but by women.

501
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,830
Women have ruined the society of West, Western society.

502
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,840
Is the Indian women who have kept the society intact.

503
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,930
All My really thanks to their solid behavior towards life.

504
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,880
It is the women of this country

505
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:15,900
who have ruined all that was so delicate,

506
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,920
emotional, beautiful, love, affection, compassion.

507
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,870
Women are there to give joy

508
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,810
and happiness and emotional security to the whole society.

509
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,970
While they take over, “Do this, give that, do that.”

510
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,800
Even the husbands have become just like servants in the house.

511
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,810
“You haven’t done the cleaning properly,

512
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,960
you haven’t cleaned the kitchen properly.”

513
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,940
I went to England, I was surprised all kitchen

514
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,000
cleaning and all that is so well done in England,

515
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,880
you see you have everything for cleaning this,

516
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,820
cleaning that. I said, “Why it has happened?”

517
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,820
It’s the men, you see, they had to do it

518
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,840
so they found out all the ways and methods.

519
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Have to be sparkling all right, sparkling you want,

520
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,820
I’ll get you such a thing that

521
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,870
if you put in your hand your hand will burn,

522
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,850
all the acids put everywhere,

523
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,980
with a big glove in the hand put it everywhere.

524
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,800
And everything gets all right.

525
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,940
Then the children, you see, suffer,

526
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,900
because that’s the job of a gardener,

527
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,870
beautiful things that are born,

528
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,860
to be looked after with that kindness.

529
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,020
But you over-indulge into your children in the beginning.

530
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,900
A mother is like a gardener, she has to prune also;

531
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,890
she has to cut also,

532
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,810
so the growth is all right.

533
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,880
If you child is spoilt

534
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,020
you’re no good a mother, useless you are.

535
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,030
But you groom your husband not your children,

536
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,890
just the other way round,

537
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,950
because ego is towards your husband all the time grooming.

538
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,030
“Sit here, go there, what’s this?”

539
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,800
Money business, “Give me all the money,

540
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,880
I keep all the money,” everything.

541
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,940
Now one may say that the law is such.

542
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,920
If the law is stupid, the Sahaja Yoginis

543
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,950
should not take to such a law.

544
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,840
That law has ruined you all, I tell you.

545
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,840
Because this is such an important part of life,

546
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,040
it is such an important area of life

547
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,880
that it should not have suffered.

548
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,920
Where affection, love, kindness,

549
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,880
all that is required is missing,

550
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,800
then you become people without any meaning.

551
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,920
Life is aimless. You don’t know what to do,

552
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,940
that’s why the children commit suicide.

553
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,010
And then the love should be such that they should be pruned,

554
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
for that you must have wisdom,

555
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,840
which also one does not develop,

556
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,810
because if you run after your Mooladhara Chakra

557
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,920
how can you have wisdom?

558
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,880
Here men have befooled you completely.

559
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,040
Completely they have befooled you, take it from Me.

560
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,990
You must keep your wisdom intact.

561
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,960
And not only that they have befooled you,

562
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,850
but they themselves have stooped down to befool you.

563
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,910
So they have their devious methods,

564
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,040
they are not straightforward.

565
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,800
So, as Sahaja Yogis we are above all these things,

566
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,020
we have reached the state where we are above.

567
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,010
We are here for correcting

568
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,960
all those things that have gone wrong in the society,

569
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,040
because Sahaja Yoga faces towards the society,

570
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,840
not towards yourself only.

571
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,810
So at this stage we have to understand

572
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,890
what we have to do is:

573
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,040
first of all our own understanding should be such.

574
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,970
Even now with all this movement of Sahaja Yoga understanding,

575
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,040
women don’t realize that they have to be like women.

576
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,800
I have seen them, they still, “What’s wrong?” Still go on,

577
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,020
and men don’t understand that they have to be like men,

578
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,940
even after so many (things/years?).

579
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,910
And if they they become really like men,

580
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,990
women will appreciate them.

581
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,990
And if you become really like women,

582
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,950
men will appreciate you.

583
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,820
You see, it’s the opposites that attract each other,

584
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:33,860
that should be normal.

585
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,890
But we live in abnormal way

586
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,820
that the men are women and the women are men.

587
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,030
What do you do now?

588
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,970
So it is very important

589
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,000
for men to understand now

590
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,860
- because I am going to talk to women later on

591
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,860
- that they should become like men.

592
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,990
They must fix up things, they must take decisions,

593
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,870
they must be the one who must rule.

594
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,940
But that’s outward, actually it’s the source is the woman,

595
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,950
the woman is the potential and man is the kinetic.

596
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,930
For example, there’s a fan moving.

597
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,800
Movement of the fan is the kinetic force you can say,

598
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,040
but the potential force that is within us

599
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,880
is the one which is the electricity,

600
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,980
which is coming from the source.

601
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,940
Which is higher, the fan that moves or the source?

602
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,010
Let the women decide and men understand.

603
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,860
But if that source dries out and wants to become the fan,

604
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,870
no fan will work.

605
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,930
Upside down situation.

606
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,010
If you realize you are the source,

607
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,950
you are the one who is going to give all the shakti to men,

608
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,990
you will stop behaving like men.

609
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,970
It doesn’t mean that you cannot go to work, you cannot do;

610
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,860
but take to work which is more suitable to women.

611
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,810
Like I would not like a woman to have a bus driver’s job

612
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,890
or a truck driver, or wrestler.

613
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,000
No. I’m not telling you; I’m telling from experience.

614
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,900
Once I was traveling,

615
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,910
I was a student at that time, in Lahore, you see,

616
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,800
and I was traveling by train and at some station,

617
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,830
you see, the train stopped in the night

618
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,020
and a lady came and she said, “Open the door for me.”

619
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,880
So I said, “But it’s so crowded, all right I’ll try, I’ll try.”

620
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,940
And she said. “If You don’t open I can break it.”

621
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,960
I said, “How can you?”

622
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,890
She said, “You don’t know who I am?” I said, “Who?”

623
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,830
She said, “I am Ahmida Bhanu.”

624
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,990
I said, ‘Who’s Ahmida Bhanu?” “The wrestler lady.”

625
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,960
“Oh, baba,” I said, “Thank God.”

626
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,860
I said, “If you’re a wrestler lady

627
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,870
why are you coming in the ladies department,

628
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,010
why don’t you go to the men’s?”

629
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,980
And she pushed the door so violently,

630
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,860
she came up and I looked at her, you know I said,

631
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,980
“Wow, what a person!”

632
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,800
And she sat down, you see, with her whole countenance

633
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,000
and everything, her gait and state of sitting,

634
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,840
everything was so manly.

635
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,900
Like that she sat down and said,

636
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,890
“Come along now those who want to say I should not sit here.”

637
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,910
I said, “Nobody wants that now, Madam, you sit comfortably.

638
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,880
But we’ll have to get somebody

639
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,910
from the other compartment to have wrestling.”

640
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,000
And then she was quiet, and she was really,

641
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,880
I saw her all her muscles so overdeveloped

642
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,820
and she was really looking like

643
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,840
I would say a Western cow, we can say.

644
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,880
Like the cows here look like buffalos, not like cows.

645
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Something very funny I cannot forget that,

646
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,880
you see that experience, I was very young and I was really,

647
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,830
I didn’t know, and I felt like laughing but I couldn’t even

648
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,930
laugh at her, she’ll box my (face?).

649
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,930
So this is what it is, that we are ending up there,

650
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,010
must know that, how far are we going.

651
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,960
Are we going to become wrestlers?

652
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,980
So this is what it is,

653
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,890
one has to learn that it has been there for ages,

654
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,810
ages it has been there.

655
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,800
I have seen, I’ve read books, some books, old books;

656
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,930
I’ve seen some films also,

657
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,810
where they’ve shown even in olden times,

658
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,800
the women used to have broom in their hands

659
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,990
hitting their husband sort of thing.

660
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,910
We, too, have some of them blessed in India

661
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,950
but they’re very, very few, very few women like that.

662
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,890
Not a big number but it may increase, God knows, you see,

663
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,820
so keep your fingers crossed,

664
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,930
but I would say that this is what is happening.

665
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,830
So with too much ego of men which goes into Left Vishuddhi

666
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,910
they say, “No, let the women take over, it’s all right,

667
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,990
let them be satisfied. No more of their aggression,

668
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,920
let them have their own.”

669
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,860
So they do what they like,

670
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,920
men are not bothered and they go into their left this thing,

671
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,870
and there’s no enjoyment of marriage or love.

672
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,980
So now we had yesterday the other marriage

673
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,950
for the benefit of your children, for the goodness of them,

674
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,890
all that, take your roles as women and men.

675
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,000
Your roles are as women and men

676
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,830
and you’ll see you’ll enjoy it.

677
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,850
The quarrel should be on that role.

678
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,950
The man wants to do something for you, you should say,

679
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,860
“No, no, no how can you do? That’s too much for me.

680
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,020
Let me do this work.”

681
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,010
As I’ve told you many a times

682
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,020
how My husband when he gets angry

683
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,910
he wants to wash his undershirt, you see to show he’s angry.

684
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,980
Or when he’s very angry, then he will clean the bathroom.

685
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,930
But he does it so badly

686
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,040
that I know that it is he has done.

687
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,990
I feel like laughing but I dare not

688
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,810
because I must keep his spirit on.

689
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,930
And then he starts talking in a very you see,

690
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,880
respectable way to everyone.

691
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,820
“Thou,” he calls everyone ‘thou,’ you see.

692
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,990
“Thou,” he says, “Thou are like that, thou are like that,”

693
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,040
so I know now he is really angry for something.

694
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,910
But he won’t say what he is angry with, you see.

695
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,880
Then we have to find out what is he angry with,

696
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,950
and if so, don’t feel guilty, correct it.

697
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,870
And then he fights - you see there are so many ways

698
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,020
of neutralizing the anger.

699
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,830
The first thing that happens with ego is the anger.

700
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,880
As yesterday you got married,

701
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,010
you must know how to neutralize this

702
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,820
because still ego is there.

703
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,980
Now to find out how to neutralize

704
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,970
the anger of another person is a very beautiful thing

705
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,820
which I’ve never seen your writers handling,

706
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,860
but in India we have many writers

707
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
who have handled the situation.

708
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,930
Now you must find out

709
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,890
what are the weak points of your husband, first of all,

710
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,040
and of your wife.

711
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,820
On what point she get upset.

712
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,920
Now the attitude should be we should not upset her,

713
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,030
we should not make her angry,

714
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,940
and another attitude of the wife the same way,

715
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,940
much more for the husband.

716
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,820
So now, what are the soft points

717
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,930
on which  he really gets upset? Just study, it’s very simple,

718
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,000
laugh at it, don’t take it seriously

719
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,960
but be careful to avoid that.

720
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,870
Now also find out what makes him happy.

721
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,890
Like if I’m really sometimes - I never get angry,

722
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,910
as you know that, I never get angry,

723
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,890
but if I am showing off My anger just …

724
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,820
So, now how to show that,

725
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,980
how to neutralize an anger of a person?

726
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,840
Say now, supposing I am trying to show,

727
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,870
if you put a child in My lap - finished, anger is gone.

728
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,040
I cannot show anger with a child on My lap, is simple.

729
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,950
So you must find out.

730
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,950
Like My husband, you see, if he’s angry supposing,

731
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,920
I know him then if I tell him that

732
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,850
“What about getting Me a nice sari.”

733
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,940
Ah, finished, then he’s very happy.

734
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,860
Ah, I’ve done him the greatest favor, you see.

735
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,970
Like that, you see, you must find out

736
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,990
what thing pleases your husband,

737
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,910
what thing pleases your wife, and neutralize it.

738
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,810
And, you see, little things like that you must learn.

739
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,980
This is the art of living,

740
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,940
this is the art of living a Sahaja Yogi life.

741
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,840
Is the art of living it,

742
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,030
how with little few things you see how I manage.

743
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,880
Now you must have seen how in My lecture

744
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,920
I say quite serious things, but in your bubbles of laughter

745
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,990
it just settles down in your mind,

746
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,880
that’s how you should do it.

747
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,950
Because humor is one of the greatest things

748
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,950
that puts the thing through, makes the person understand,

749
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,820
and it doesn’t harm anyone.

750
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,040
That’s how things improve,

751
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,000
and when you see that you are settled down in peace,

752
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,840
that’s the first thing a husband and wife must do

753
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,920
is to settle down in peace.

754
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,940
Children feel all right, everyone feels all right

755
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,840
and then gradually let it correct.

756
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,860
You have no responsibility of correcting each other;

757
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,000
but if you have married somebody who is not a Sahaja Yogini,

758
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,840
who is horrid and all that,

759
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,940
then the question is very different.

760
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,800
But both are Sahaja Yogis married before Me,

761
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,860
should be the easiest thing to do.

762
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,870
And protect each other; look after each other.

763
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,960
There should be complete confidence.

764
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,910
And this is - we have in our country, really I must say

765
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,900
our marriage system has something special about it.

766
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,830
What happened, once I went to Singapore you’ll be surprised,

767
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,980
the early times, I was going to America,

768
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,830
and there was one horrible diplomat’s wife,

769
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,910
she came drunk to the program

770
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,860
and she was asked to get out because she was drunk.

771
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,000
So she informed our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

772
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,960
that “This lady is doing this kind of work

773
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,980
and She should not do this, She’s a diplomat’s wife

774
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,950
and She’s so highly placed” and this and that.”

775
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,830
So Indira Gandhi without understanding anything

776
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,930
told one fellow who was Haksar,

777
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,890
who was her main person that

778
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,040
“You go and tell Mr. Srivastava

779
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,880
that this should not be done and She should be brought back.”

780
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,820
So the minister, you see,

781
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,800
getting a message for Indira Gandhi

782
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,800
means the deathblow has come to the minister that time.

783
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:43,800
So he sent for My husband.

784
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,830
And he called him and he said that

785
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,000
“We think you wife should be called back

786
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,830
and this is what has happened.”

787
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,890
And he said, “Why? Why do you want to call Her?

788
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,830
She doesn’t drink, She doesn’t smoke,

789
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,940
She doesn’t do anything wrong. She’s the most decent woman,

790
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,820
She’s very dignified and She knows what She’s doing.

791
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,020
She’s doing good work for no money at all.

792
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,850
She’s doing nothing wrong and if you want I’ll resign

793
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,980
but I’ll not call Her.”

794
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,010
And he got a fright of his life,

795
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,960
because if he resigns who’s going to do the job?

796
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,010
So capable. Just said, “I’ll resign.”

797
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,970
And they were all shocked at it you see,

798
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,800
the way he was confident.

799
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,940
And this I came to know through somebody else,

800
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,970
told himself the minister who was dead,

801
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,000
half dead with the message from the Prime Minister, you see.

802
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,800
And he then sent back, he also got to see within himself,

803
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,800
he said, “I know the lady very well, She’s very dignified,

804
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,940
She’s a very decent lady, She’s very dharmic

805
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,000
we shouldn’t disturb Her.”

806
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,930
While the fellow Haksar who had sent the message

807
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,030
also got a shock, you see,

808
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,860
and pushed back the shock to Indira Gandhi.

809
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,970
Since that she has never,

810
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,830
never tried to interfere with My work.

811
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,890
You’ll be surprised, she’s never tried to interfere.

812
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,810
This is my husband’s confidence in My work and understanding.

813
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,890
That you should have.

814
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,940
You must know your wife and know your husband,

815
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,040
they cannot do such and such thing.

816
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,030
About, same about your children.

817
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:10,020
You must have full confidence in them.

818
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,960
You must know what they are, what they are up to,

819
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,910
how far they can go.

820
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,000
And then this confidence, an inner understanding

821
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,990
is the one road to peace, love and affection.

822
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,010
Complete confidence into each other,

823
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:25,830
wherever they may be.

824
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,960
I can say with confidence you send my daughters anywhere

825
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,850
they will never take to adharmic life,

826
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,860
nor my son-in-laws, but my own daughters I can tell you.

827
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,960
They can never think of adharmic life,

828
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,030
whatever you may try.

829
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,900
It should be that confidence within you

830
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,980
about your own children.

831
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,990
Like they were small, very small and the neighbors came

832
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,860
and said that “Your daughters came and were using this,

833
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,960
our garden, for morning ablution.”

834
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,970
I said. “What?” Said, “My children,

835
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:03,810
even if they can go into your bathroom, you take them.

836
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,880
I give you two thousand rupees just now, right now.

837
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,880
You just ask them to go to your bathroom,

838
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,880
that’s all.”

839
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,880
I know them too well.

840
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,810
If somebody will say, “Your daughter has taken something,”

841
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,950
I know them too well, they can never touch anybody’s things,

842
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
I know them too well.

843
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,990
They’ll never take any obligation from anyone like that,

844
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,030
I know them too well.

845
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
So that’s what you should know your children too well.

846
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,020
Don’t insult them in the presence of others.

847
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,040
Build up their character and majesty by saying,

848
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,860
“Come along, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

849
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,910
you are great, you’ll be this, that,”

850
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:45,860
and put them on that path,

851
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:48,930
keep them there, respect them.

852
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,900
But don’t spoil them. Don’t spoil them.

853
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,810
We normally spoil.

854
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,940
Either we’re over-indulgent or you make them over-indulgent,

855
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,870
both things are wrong, is again ego.

856
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,900
Tell them how to share things, tell them how to share.

857
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,960
And like if they share,

858
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,960
they give it to somebody else you should be happy,

859
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,010
it’s given to others. “Give this to others,

860
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,920
let the others play.”

861
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,880
You see, you show your happiness on that,

862
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,990
you yourself give to others,

863
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,950
then the children learn all these things.

864
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,920
So marriage is a very big bondage for Sahaja Yoga.

865
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,030
Through marriages we are all bound together.

866
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,850
It’s all a society of very happily married people.

867
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,030
Now if somebody is not capable of having a good marriage,

868
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,850
better forget about it, forget it.

869
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,900
See, after all I have seen women of sixty, of My age,

870
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,820
asking for a marriage.

871
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,840
Yes, there are women and men and they’re sixty years,

872
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,820
“Mother, I’m only sixty and I would like to get married.”

873
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,860
I said, “ What?” At sixty I have thousands of children,

874
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,870
how can you say of such a thing?

875
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:55,010
I mean, you should not be a bride all your life.

876
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,910
You should be a mother and a grandmother.

877
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,910
I think after forty-five

878
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,940
nobody should think of marriage, is nonsense.

879
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,880
It’s nonsense after forty-five, all the,

880
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,800
even the married women should know they are mothers

881
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,970
and they are going to be grandmothers,

882
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,890
they’re all the time brides.

883
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,910
You see that’s why, that’s one of the reasons

884
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,860
why marriages fail.

885
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,890
Because you are not a bride after say,

886
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,870
thirty years of age or thirty-five years of age,

887
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,960
you are a mother, absolute mother you are.

888
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,010
And you are a father, and that’s how you live as father

889
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,030
and mother of the children.

890
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,040
We are called like that in our country.

891
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,980
Till the age of thirty, thirty years,

892
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,030
we are called as the brides like doolai

893
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,860
but once you are grown up

894
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,980
- I’m never called as My name by anyone.

895
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,960
They say “Kalpana’s Mother” or “Sadhana’s Mother.”

896
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,010
Or even My husband is called as Kalpana’s father,

897
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,870
is never called by his name,

898
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,860
because you become a father and a mother,

899
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,930
accept that position.

900
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,950
But no, you want to be brides at that age,

901
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,830
so you want to have all the bed like a bride has,

902
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,810
all the bedroom thing like a bride has,

903
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,030
and the bedroom thing and it doesn’t work out.

904
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,990
Because you are no more a bride,

905
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,930
and then you think, “Oh, this man has become insipid,”

906
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,030
“This woman has become insipid,”

907
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,970
then you go to another woman, another man, goes on.

908
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,910
Then you go to children

909
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,980
and spoil the innocence of the people.

910
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,020
But if you accept, grow properly, mature like Sahaja Yogis,

911
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,840
as father and mother, as dignified people.

912
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,860
It’s not the source of love only as husbands’

913
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,810
or wives’ relationship,

914
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,820
there are so many relationships, which are a greater source,

915
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,820
but depends on at what point you are.

916
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,890
When you are a small little river, all right;

917
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,930
but now you have become the ocean, so become the ocean.

918
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,920
When you become the sea, become the sea.

919
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,800
When you become the ocean, you become the ocean.

920
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,840
A sea cannot remain like a little,

921
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,040
little small little beginning, can it?

922
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,990
In the same way everyone must know that

923
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:02,830
they must grow out from this relationship

924
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,980
and should not go on hankering all the time

925
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,940
that husband and wife.

926
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,910
Like forty-five years of age

927
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,880
they are still finding out their husbands, are they mad?

928
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,820
This should stop in our Sahaja Yoga now,

929
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,880
all those who have gone beyond a certain age

930
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,040
should stop bothering Me about marriages,

931
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:24,860
should become mothers,

932
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,000
there are so many children to be looked after,

933
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,800
we are going to have nurseries, better be there.

934
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,800
What is it, what is the companionship?

935
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,830
The companionship is with children, with the grandchildren,

936
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,820
with great-grandchildren.

937
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,020
This is what one has to understand, men and women both.

938
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,870
Men are just the same.

939
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:47,860
Men also try never become fathers.

940
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,010
If you are full-fledged fathers,

941
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,010
you don’t have these ideas of marriage, forget it.

942
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,970
If it doesn’t work out with one woman, forget it.

943
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,980
Then forget it. No need, you’ve had enough of it.

944
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:07,820
So this kind of thing is not necessary at all,

945
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,010
and it has worked in a society

946
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,940
which is not a Sahaja Yogi society,

947
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,910
so it should work in you.

948
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,990
So social ways Indians are quite good,

949
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,880
but they’re bad in economics and politics.

950
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,940
Never follow their politics, horrid.

951
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,910
Horrid.

952
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,930
I mean, I can’t think of a worse politics

953
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,880
that Indian politics, is the worst of all.

954
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,900
If you listen to that,

955
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,850
you will not know whether to cry or laugh,

956
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:37,020
is such idiots you know, all donkeys have gone into politics,

957
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,900
absolutely donkeys. Worse than that.

958
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,010
They bray like donkeys, they behave like donkeys,

959
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,850
they kick each other,

960
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,020
they do all kind of things can you imagine,

961
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:48,860
it’s so horrifying.

962
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,030
I mean if you want to have a joke

963
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,870
then you can look at it from a joke point of view,

964
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,890
of the donkeys, you see, behaving like,

965
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:00,980
absolutely as if they are in charge of our great country.

966
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:02,990
So most of them are donkeys,

967
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,040
I’ve not come across many who are sensible.

968
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,010
And those who are sensible also want to become donkeys.

969
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,030
What to do? That is their greatest desire is to

970
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,880
- imagine a saint wants to become a donkey!

971
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,860
So let us know that whatever are our good points

972
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,860
are our good points that we should not lose.

973
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,000
Whatever are our bad points we should correct them.

974
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,970
This is a very balanced view towards oneself.

975
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,860
Because we are the gain,

976
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,800
nobody else is going to gain and Sahaja Yogis

977
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,970
have to be selfish about it. We are the gainers;

978
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,920
if we gain, the whole body gains,

979
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,850
whole of Sahaja Yoga gains.

980
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,890
So this is what I am telling you about your social life

981
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,880
which is very important, and about your ego.

982
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,960
But the most important thing is that

983
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,840
once you are in the Sahasara you become My brain,

984
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,880
you become really My brain.

985
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,980
And so you have to be very careful

986
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,960
because you’re not thinking about your family,

987
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,820
your children, your household.

988
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,990
Not thinking about Melbourne ashram

989
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,910
or Sydney ashram or Australia,

990
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,900
but you’re thinking about the whole world

991
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,930
and the whole Universe, and the betterment of it.

992
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,870
When you grow to that state

993
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,850
you become really part and parcel of My brain,

994
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,970
which is concerned with very bigger visions, higher things.

995
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,840
It works on lower levels also,

996
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,010
that’s something good about it,

997
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,010
but it can work on your individual levels.

998
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,020
I pay attention to your individual problems,

999
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,860
to your individual suggestions, to anything that you say,

1000
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,850
but the light is for the whole Universe.

1001
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,940
So we enter into the realm of universal religion,

1002
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,880
which we have to awaken, which we have to work out.

1003
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,980
Unless and until you achieve that state,

1004
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,000
you will not be called full-fledged Sahaja Yogis.

1005
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:03,920
So, to achieve that you must work hard,

1006
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,990
or we can call now you are Sahaja Yogis,

1007
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,000
you’ll become maha yogis.

1008
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,920
So, we have to achieve that state of maha yoga.

1009
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,020
From this to that is very simple, (it) works out.

1010
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,820
Imagine four years back I never thought

1011
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,020
that I will be able to establish so many of you

1012
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,040
here as My children, and it has happened today.

1013
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,890
It’s such a great thing that in four years

1014
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,910
we have been able to achieve such beautiful results

1015
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,860
and next year will be greater still,

1016
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,950
I can see from the way people were there.

1017
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,040
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga obedience

1018
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,020
to what Mother says is all right.

1019
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,010
But some people have a bad habit of taking up over,

1020
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,990
“for Mother’s sake do it, for Mother.” Who is the person?

1021
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,940
Why should anybody say that do it for Mothers sake?

1022
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,950
Or Mother says so.

1023
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,880
No, when you are the Spirit you understand what Mother says,

1024
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,900
so try to understand your Spirit.

1025
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,930
That’s the best way you can work it out

1026
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,030
and you can be nice.

1027
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,920
I want all our children to grow from that height,

1028
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,940
let them start with a better standards,

1029
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,900
from a better levels, because we started from a lower levels,

1030
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,010
we had problems, but let our children start

1031
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,990
from a higher level and Melbourne is the place I’ve chosen

1032
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,890
for our children to grow.

1033
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,010
So I hope women will take their roles,

1034
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,880
men will take their roles

1035
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,890
and it will be a nice family system built here,

1036
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,960
a nice society and this nice society.

1037
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,830
What’s it? Put if off.

1038
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,830
I know.

1039
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,990
I know the lights very well.

1040
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,030
I know how they act.

1041
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,960
Vishnumaya, that’s Vishnumaya,

1042
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,820
we have harnessed the Vishnumaya.

1043
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,990
From where did we get light, Vishnumaya, hidden where?

1044
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,840
The Vishnumaya, you see, is the One what we need today,

1045
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,950
and to understand it in a subtle way

1046
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,950
how the Vishnumaya comes.

1047
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,920
See now how sahaj, this thing came there

1048
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,000
I could speak on Vishnumaya,

1049
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,960
because to shift the subject on Vishnumaya is not easy.

1050
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,950
See, you must see the play, you must see the play.

1051
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:34,890
Now this Vishmumaya, how does it come?

1052
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,870
How it acts through Me so well?

1053
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,920
How, what happens, from where does it come?

1054
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,950
Hydroelectric, how hydroelectric was, in water,

1055
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,870
it is in water in the Guru Tattwa,

1056
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,040
but when, when it comes down,

1057
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,940
when the Guru Tattwa has come down to you.

1058
00:56:53,850 --> 00:56:58,820
On that level the Vishnumaya acts,

1059
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,040
that liberates and acts.

1060
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,960
For what? For enlightening.

1061
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,950
What happens in the gross happens in the subtle.

1062
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,870
So One has to take an incarnation,

1063
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,930
so the Guru principle has to take an incarnation

1064
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,930
to come down to this earth.

1065
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:26,810
So Vishnumaya acts and enlightens people

1066
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,000
and this is what it is, and how the whole thing works out.

1067
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,820
Now you have seen how I could change the topic

1068
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,810
suddenly to that, and you didn’t feel it.

1069
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:43,970
But I just wanted you to see how Mother changes the topics,

1070
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,890
because there are some incidents something happens

1071
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,930
somewhere, which I know, and it changes.

1072
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:55,850
And it looks like a smooth one subject going on.

1073
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:59,810
Another thing I have to tell you

1074
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,010
that all of you must know Sahaja Yoga full well.

1075
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,820
Very few people really know about Kundalini,

1076
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,980
really know about vibrations.

1077
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:07,880
They do not know where is the Void.

1078
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:08,950
There should be a regular class,

1079
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,000
even for grown up Sahaja Yogis.

1080
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,840
Where is the Void on the feet,

1081
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,000
where are the chakras on the feet?

1082
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,980
When I tell them to rub My Feet, they don’t know where it is.

1083
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,920
You may be uneducated, doesn’t matter,

1084
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,800
but in Sahaja Yoga you should be educated.

1085
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,850
You should have a full education in Sahaja Yoga.

1086
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,930
You must know where is this disease coming from,

1087
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:36,850
how to cure it. Every one of you should be educated here.

1088
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,870
So when you have your meditation class,

1089
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,800
also you must have a class to educate yourself

1090
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,040
about Sahaja Yoga,

1091
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,900
what are the things to be done.

1092
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,040
Now there’s a book, of course I saw that’s a good book

1093
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,880
they have written about children, but there’s no spontaneity,

1094
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,990
so I’ll have to work it out.

1095
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,910
But it’s not only the books but My tapes are there.

1096
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,890
When you are listening to My tapes,

1097
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,880
note down the points what Mother has said,

1098
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,950
and see for yourself.

1099
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,900
So the education in Sahaja Yoga is very important,

1100
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,860
otherwise your intelligence will rust out.

1101
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,000
You must have full education of Sahaja Yoga,

1102
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:14,040
only giving Realization is not the work.

1103
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,940
You must have, so others must know you are knowledgeable.

1104
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:21,870
The amount of education you have had nobody had before,

1105
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,910
no saint had it.

1106
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,930
So now take full advantage.

1107
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,000
Whatever your age may be, education qualification maybe,

1108
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,890
what doesn’t matter but you should all know

1109
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,820
what is Sahaja Yoga, what it means, how it works out.

1110
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,840
Ask questions yourself and find answers.

1111
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,880
You all are still students of Sahaja Yoga - must know that,

1112
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,910
you are still students of Sahaja Yoga and you must master it,

1113
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,960
you must know it, every word of it.

1114
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,990
Just to enjoy Sahaja Yoga is not the point,

1115
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:51,840
you must also know.

1116
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,970
Like, if you enjoy a cake cooked by somebody,

1117
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,890
you must know how it is cooked,

1118
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,840
because then you can cook for others.

1119
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,810
But if you don’t know how to cook

1120
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,040
people are not going to believe. This is what I’ve seen.

1121
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,820
Then I’ve seen some Sahaja Yogis

1122
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,860
are all the time doing the work,

1123
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,920
they’re active because they’ve been active before,

1124
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,030
but some are lethargic.

1125
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,940
You can see even among two Indian people

1126
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,830
you’ll find the same difference,

1127
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,930
though they are here or they may be there, it should not be.

1128
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:24,920
Everybody should try to create the same kind

1129
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,990
of an enthusiasm and dynamism, not one person.

1130
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,910
If one person does it, then it’s no use.

1131
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,020
Sometimes such a one person can be very dominating also.

1132
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,850
Everybody should work, the whole body has to work,

1133
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:37,960
if we can develop that,

1134
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:44,000
that will help the complete development, upliftment.

1135
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,800
All right?

1136
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,010
So today on this day of My Birthday,

1137
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,020
I want to bless you very much,

1138
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,910
but every birthday is reducing My age you must know that,

1139
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,920
and so you must grow up now to take over, is important.

1140
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,010
Is very important that you must grow up,

1141
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,890
so-called age of Mine,

1142
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,010
though it doesn’t show but it is decreasing,

1143
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,020
you must know that, and so you have to now

1144
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,850
fasten your movements, get to it, work it out.

1145
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,830
When others come, talk to them nicely, give them joy,

1146
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:19,040
don’t give them any - give them joy.

1147
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,930
Look after them, be kind to them,

1148
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,870
that is going to be attractive than to,

1149
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,970
immediately somebody says, “You are a bhoot you get out.”

1150
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,800
When they are in Sahaja Yoga, when they are there,

1151
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:28,850
I will tell them off.

1152
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,970
There are still, I know some of them still here,

1153
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,850
we have to tell them that,

1154
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,840
“You have a problem, you better get out.”

1155
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,910
It’s all right, they’ll have to get out of the ashrams

1156
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,900
for a while then come back.

1157
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,870
It has to be like that, otherwise they cannot be corrected

1158
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,950
and such people must accept gladly that

1159
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,930
they should be all right, they must change;

1160
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,870
they must be better than to continue

1161
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,010
with whatever they have because of their ego.

1162
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,800
So try to co-operate with your self

1163
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,910
because it wants to be better, and better and better.

1164
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:59,800
So all those people whom I’ll be asking,

1165
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,800
I’ll tell Warren, whom those people whom I find

1166
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,810
are not all right should get out of ashram.

1167
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,000
Ashram is not a place where all kinds of people should stay.

1168
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,040
Here only the pure up to a point they should be.

1169
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,910
There should be certain minimum standard they must have.

1170
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,930
If they do not have that standard, they get out.

1171
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:18,800
Even if there’s a woman who is dominating,

1172
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,870
or a man who is like a woman, has to get out.

1173
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,040
You have to be normal people,

1174
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,870
otherwise others who come and they see

1175
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,970
one man standing like a chicken cut from here, you see.

1176
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:34,900
They just don’t feel impressed.

1177
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:51,020
I tell you, like a miserable Christ you see as I showed you,

1178
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,930
standing there limply like that.

1179
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,970
I don’t know who feels impressed by that.

1180
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,950
You must have somebody like you have Christ

1181
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,040
in the Sistine Chapel, you see, standing

1182
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:04,950
like a stalwart that’s how the men should be,

1183
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:10,800
but dignified, respectable, kindly,

1184
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:14,800
majestic is all right.

1185
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,020
And the women should be very sweet and nice.

1186
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,860
It pays a very, very long and a great dividend.

1187
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,970
Very, very, long,

1188
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,870
you don’t know how much it has paid Me.

1189
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,990
It is coming so handy today to Me.

1190
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,970
You see when I was not doing Sahaja Yoga

1191
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:35,990
by My nature I’ve been kind to people,

1192
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,980
and all that has come.

1193
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,850
One example I’ll give you, in London one fellow came,

1194
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:48,820
his name is …that commissioner’s name is what?

1195
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,040
Commissioner of Pune, he’s now commissioner of Pune,

1196
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:53,830
all right.

1197
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,980
He came to see us, we had a meeting of My husband’s office

1198
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:00,850
or something. CP said, “I’ll call them for dinner.”

1199
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,860
I said, “All right.” I had cooked the dinner at home;

1200
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,030
there were about twenty-five people who came to dinner.

1201
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,870
They had dinner I must have looked after them,

1202
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,000
whatever it is.

1203
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,830
So when I went to Pune, Mehrotra,

1204
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,810
told Me that this Commissioner is very anxious

1205
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,950
that he should come as the President or the Chairman

1206
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,970
or the reception committee, must receive Me.

1207
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,830
I said, “I don’t remember who is this gentleman.

1208
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,010
I remember somebody with the same name.”

1209
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:25,010
He said, “No, no, no, no this is another one.”

1210
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,850
Now this is one of them who had come

1211
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,020
and he praised Me so much, I was amazed how he saw all that.

1212
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:36,800
He said, “This lady whose husband is so highly placed

1213
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,000
in life, is so humble, She’s so kind, so motherly.”

1214
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,830
And he went home and told his wife,

1215
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:43,980
“That I’ve never seen such a lady before,

1216
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:46,020
such a perfect Lady.”

1217
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:47,930
That’s what I did I don’t know.

1218
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:51,860
I must have cooked well, of course that I do,

1219
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,960
but I must have looked after him well,

1220
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,900
I must have been kind to him, to all of them.

1221
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:05,830
I must have not eaten anything Myself,

1222
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,000
looked after, must have done something,

1223
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:08,020
I don’t remember what I did.

1224
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,820
But by My own nature I have to do,

1225
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,960
and it is not today but I’ve seen so many of them

1226
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,900
come so handy, only because of this nature of Mine,

1227
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,840
only because of this nature of Mine.

1228
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:23,810
You know our High Commissioner in UK,

1229
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,830
both the High Commissioners the first one and the second one,

1230
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:27,970
B.K.Nehru, and the second one,

1231
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,800
they had such tremendous respect for Me, regard for Me,

1232
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,820
can’t imagine,

1233
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:38,930
because you have to be kind and considerate and nice.

1234
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:42,820
As you look after Me here, I looked after them.

1235
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,890
And that’s how they have such impressions,

1236
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:48,030
I tell you all my husband’s friends and everybody

1237
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,920
have such regard and respect.

1238
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,830
We went to see somebody who is head of the law,

1239
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:57,860
is the head of the Intelligence in India;

1240
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,910
he gave us a right royal treatment.

1241
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,990
The Collector of Customs was informed that

1242
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,870
Mother’s children are coming,

1243
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:10,040
he himself came to the airport, do you know that?

1244
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,860
He was sitting there I don’t know if he came out

1245
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:14,970
to see that you were all out.

1246
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,870
It is only My personal life with them

1247
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,910
otherwise who cares for whose wife?

1248
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,840
So many came after My husband,

1249
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,880
nobody’s bothered about their wives.

1250
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:26,920
Anywhere, you see I came this time

1251
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,950
with My husband to go to China

1252
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,990
and his agents who were in Japan and other places,

1253
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,800
Honolulu, they all came just to meet Me,

1254
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:39,040
because he comes nobody comes to see him.

1255
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,810
He said, “Now You have come, they’ve come to see.”

1256
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,860
Can you believe it?

1257
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:50,860
It’s nothing but just being a lady to them.

1258
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,020
It’s such a powerful thing.

1259
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,880
It’s such a powerful thing and women must know how to cook,

1260
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,900
that’s important.

1261
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,810
If they don’t know how to cook they’re not women,

1262
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,900
I don’t think they’re women.

1263
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:02,820
They all must know how to cook.

1264
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,990
You must learn how to cook and everybody can learn it,

1265
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:07,800
that’s very important.

1266
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,940
Is the hidden power of a woman lies in how she cooks.

1267
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,960
You see our men cannot go anywhere

1268
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,900
because we cook so well they have to come back home.

1269
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,960
They remember the food.

1270
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,800
So that is the power you have.

1271
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,890
Today we are going to have a very short puja

1272
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:29,870
because today is My Birthday

1273
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,900
and so the puja on a birthday should be such that

1274
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:42,870
it should be more deep, more heartfelt, more joyous,

1275
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:48,020
than it should sort of go on a ritual side.

1276
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,940
There’s no need to have much rituals

1277
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,040
because we are in a joyous mood

1278
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,970
celebrating our Mother’s Birthday.

1279
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,850
Already we are there,

1280
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,960
whatever is needed for you to be there

1281
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,950
is not needed now because you are in that joyous mood,

1282
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,950
all right?

1283
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,840
So only thing a very short puja, I have told him,

1284
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,040
is to be done today is a Birthday.

1285
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,920
There is no need to have a huge big puja,

1286
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,920
all that is needed to bring out all the deities,

1287
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,820
they’re already there, up there,

1288
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,980
just see the vibrations they are emitting!

1289
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:22,000
They’re so very happy that you are celebrating My Birthday.

1290
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,900
So in every puja what we have to do is to awaken them,

1291
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,880
ask them to be kind to you, this, that.

1292
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,990
Though they are awakened in Me you want them to be.

1293
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:32,950
But now they’re all awakened in you

1294
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,970
we don’t have to have big puja at all,

1295
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:36,870
there’s no need at all.

1296
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:39,920
And this is what I’ve told Modi that you have a very,

1297
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:43,840
very short puja and a very short puja should be all right.

1298
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,980
So today’s talk was just like a puja.

1299
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,000
Remember that this is meant for you

1300
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,890
when you were not Sahaja Yogis.

1301
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:55,880
Today it is not meant for you. So you won’t feel guilty.

1302
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,870
First remember you are Sahaja Yogis,

1303
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,960
you are My children and I love you very much,

1304
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,830
very, very much.

1305
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,860
So please have confidence in yourself,

1306
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,020
complete confidence in yourself, all right?

1307
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:10,850
That’s the greatest thing you can give Me today

1308
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:14,040
as a present. May God bless you!

1309
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,920
Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.

1310
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:32,970
So for this you have to have washing of My Feet

1311
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,930
for ten - five minutes

1312
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,850
and washing of My Hands for about ten minutes,

1313
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,020
that’s all, as simple as that.

1314
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,030
Now we don’t need many people for that,

1315
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,940
just put that thing here.
