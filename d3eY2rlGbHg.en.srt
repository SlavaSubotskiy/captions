1
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:29,875
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:53,999 --> 00:01:01,166
As you know Shri Krishna is the incarnation of Vishnu.

3
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:14,667
And Vishnu is the one who is the preserver of this universe.

4
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:19,959
When this whole world was created

5
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,291
it was necessary

6
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,792
to create a preserver also

7
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,166
because this world would have been destroyed

8
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:44,083
and completely if it is left alone without a preserver,

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,917
then the way human beings are,

10
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,333
they could have done anything to this world.

11
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,166
But so, Vishnu is the preserver.

12
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:03,083
He's the preserver and He's the only one really incarnates.

13
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,875
Of course,

14
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,417
sometimes Brahmadeva also incarnated,

15
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,792
but He only takes forms.

16
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,999
In our evolutionary process He has taken different forms.

17
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:20,250
He came on this earth in different ways.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,125
But still He had, as you say,

19
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:26,917
twelve

20
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:42,000
up to twelve was Shri Rama and up through ten He was there.

21
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:54,792
So He created also an atmosphere of the many great prophets

22
00:02:55,125 --> 00:03:01,458
around Himself so that they could preserve the dharma

23
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,458
of this universe.

24
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:12,000
So the basis of preservation was dharma,

25
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,250
which has got, as you know,

26
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:25,999
the most important basic foundation for spiritual life.

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,458
In this dharma whatever was to be established

28
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,792
was to be established balance.

29
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,125
Was a habit with people to go to extremes in anything.

30
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,667
So He created a balance within us.

31
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:51,542
The first principal of dharma was to create balance.

32
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,417
If a person doesn't have a balance

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,458
then he cannot achieve his ascent.

34
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,083
As simple as that.

35
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,834
If you don't have a balance in your airplane it cannot ascend.

36
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,333
If you don't have a balance, say on a ship, it won't move.

37
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,667
In the same way,

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,875
first the human beings had to achieve the balance.

39
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,667
But they are born with different capacities,

40
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,250
with different capabilities.

41
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:32,083
As said that, "Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Jhati rupena samstita",

42
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,834
means the aptitudes are different.

43
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,458
They are born with different aptitudes,

44
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,542
with different faces, with different colors,

45
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,709
because variety was to be created.

46
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,667
If everybody looked the same, you see they would be looking

47
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,542
like some robots or something.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,250
So everybody was created in a different way,

49
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,999
according to the country,

50
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,458
according to the parents.

51
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:07,917
All this was organized by the principal of Shri Vishnu,

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,709
that He created this world in different varieties.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,917
He gave variety, and Shri Krishna is the master of it.

54
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,875
At the time when Shri Krishna came,

55
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,208
people were extremely serious type

56
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,083
and had become very ritualistic.

57
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,792
The reason was that Rama came and He talked of maryadas,

58
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:45,250
and these maryadas made people extremely,

59
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,709
extremely austere type.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,792
In that austerity people lost the sense of joy,

61
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,208
sense of beauty, sense of variety.

62
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:03,083
So the Shri Krishna's incarnation

63
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,834
came as we call it the Sampurna,

64
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,667
it's complete because He has 16 petals.

65
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:15,333
As the moon has 16 kalas He too had 16 petals

66
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:22,250
so He's Sampurna and He is what we call is the Purnima,

67
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,041
is the full moon.

68
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:34,125
With this completeness of His incarnation,

69
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:41,375
of Vishnu's incarnation from Vishnu to many other incarnations

70
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:46,333
He came as the complete incarnation;

71
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:52,667
the total of Shri Vishnu was manifested.

72
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:00,917
So whatever was lacking in Rama's incarnation,

73
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,792
He brought it forth.

74
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,375
As you know that on the center - on the right heart

75
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,375
you have twelve petals.

76
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:15,709
With this He showed so many things

77
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,834
which people miss completely,

78
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:24,458
because, unfortunately, Gita was written down.

79
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,959
When Gita was written down,

80
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,667
people started following the book word by word, not understanding.

81
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:41,709
And in the Gita His message was never for peace.

82
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,667
He didn't say you should be peaceful.

83
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,792
It was something like Jihad.

84
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:51,333
That He said that to Arjuna, "You have to fight.

85
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,834
At this time you have to fight for dharma,

86
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,333
for the truth and you have to fight."

87
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,083
Then He said, "I can't kill my uncles

88
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,041
and I can't kill my grandfather and I can't kill my relations."

89
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:11,458
He said, "Who, who are you killing, they're already dead."

90
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,583
Because they have no dharma.

91
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,959
If you have no dharma then you are already dead.

92
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,792
So what is there to kill or not to kill

93
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,834
and that is what today we see in modern times,

94
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:30,709
especially America which is the country of Vishuddhi.

95
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,709
They have no dharma so they're already dead

96
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,709
under dope or whatever you may call it,

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,917
under fear of all kinds of diseases.

98
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:45,583
They are already dead and whom are you going to kill?

99
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:54,375
And this message was in Kurukshetra He gave to Arjuna.

100
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,792
But then he said, "You have asked me to kill these people

101
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,375
because I have Dharma in me. I am killing them, alright,

102
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:11,125
but what beyond this?"

103
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,083
What is beyond that?

104
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,500
So He describes Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,375
Beyond this was Sahaja Yoga.

106
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,458
Was, first He describes in the second chapter

107
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,458
who is the Stitha Pragya,

108
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,000
is the man who is balanced.

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,083
Then he says that such a man is never angry.

110
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
He doesn't get angry.

111
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,458
Inside he is absolutely at peace.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,959
So what He described later on is really the modern times,

113
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,792
or we can say our Sahaja Yoga

114
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,917
in which He said how a person should become.

115
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:05,834
He didn't write, or He didn't say how to become that,

116
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:11,291
but the description is just like Christ I think where He says that

117
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,500
if you somebody slaps you on one face you put the

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,583
other side of the face.

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,875
All this is actually description of Sahaja Yogis

120
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,166
of the future.

121
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:31,291
Not at that time when Khauravas were fighting the Pandavas.

122
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,000
It was not at that time.

123
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:41,166
During that fight He told him

124
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:48,667
that if you become a Stitha Pragya then you can transcend

125
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,000
all these problems,

126
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,542
all these understandings that you have,

127
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,333
and you become absolutely peaceful with yourself.

128
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:05,792
So on one side He said you have to fight.

129
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:10,208
Now in modern times we do not have to fight Kauravas,

130
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,125
there are no Kauravas

131
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,333
The five Pandavas have to fight the Khauravas.

132
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:21,417
So now what are these five Pandavas?

133
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,375
They are our senses

134
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:29,000
or we can call they are the cosmos,

135
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:35,041
divided into various elements.

136
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:39,125
One side. They have to fight,

137
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,000
they have to fight the Kauravas

138
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,125
which are within us.

139
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,999
Now there are hundred Kauravas, not one.

140
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,583
It is, if you extend it

141
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:58,083
then we can say the nature has to fight

142
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,083
something that is against the nature.

143
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,709
Now people will say anger is natural,

144
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,709
getting annoyed is natural,

145
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,625
to be aggressive is natural.

146
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,041
It is not.

147
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,125
Anger and all these things may have been natural,

148
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:31,583
but now we must know that we have the natural capacity to ascend.

149
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,583
Is natural to go higher.

150
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,834
It is natural to be Stitha pragya.

151
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,000
It is natural to be Sahaja Yogi.

152
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,500
This is also built in us, in us.

153
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,709
For example a seed is a seed.

154
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,583
When it is seed we call it seed.

155
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,750
Alright, naturally is to be seed,

156
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,375
but then it sprouts and becomes the tree.

157
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,125
So it is also natural in a seed

158
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:06,375
that all that future,

159
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,625
all the thousands of trees

160
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:12,125
it is going to be is also in that seed.

161
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,750
And now as you know they're experimenting that

162
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,166
in one seed you can get thousand

163
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:23,375
minimum of thousands of little, little sprouts in one seed

164
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:27,750
and which can be made all of them into trees or plants.

165
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,583
This is a new thing that has come up.

166
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,875
So when He said that

167
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,250
you have to become a Stitha pragya

168
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:43,166
what He was trying to say that you should achieve your balance.

169
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,375
Now this He told,

170
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
there was a war on.

171
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,625
When they were warring,

172
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,166
alright, you have to do it.

173
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,959
If you have to war with people,

174
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,959
if you have to kill them it's all right.

175
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,583
But afterwards,

176
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,834
once that is over

177
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,041
then what you have to do is to build up your spiritual sense.

178
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,625
Now the building up of the spiritual sense

179
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,750
is our work and that's what we have to do.

180
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,291
Not only dharma.

181
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,583
Many Sahaja Yogis think that they are going in dharma

182
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,375
so they are alright.

183
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,583
They are working in dharma,

184
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,709
they are living in a dharmic life.

185
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,917
They are. I'm very surprised and happy that they are doing it.

186
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,000
But that's not the end of it.

187
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,000
That's the balance part

188
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,625
where you are balancing yourself.

189
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,458
Now, what you have to do is to go ahead

190
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,291
and build up your spiritual self and spread it.

191
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,166
This is the work of Shri Krishna also

192
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,125
because He's the one who communicates all over.

193
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,166
As you know America is communicating everywhere

194
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,041
in a wrong way - but it is.

195
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,500
It has got computers,

196
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,750
it has got this,

197
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,125
all communication things it has done

198
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,125
because it is innately built in them to communicate.

199
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,917
But because they don't believe in Shri Krishna,

200
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,709
neither in dharma,

201
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,917
so the basis itself is wrong,

202
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,917
and with this wrong basis they have started spreading.

203
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,625
With this very, very wrong basis

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,125
they have started spreading ah,

205
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:48,500
all kinds of filth and dirt and I don't know what to call it,

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,709
which is against human beings,

207
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,000
which is against our ascent,

208
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,166
which is against God.

209
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,417
And they are doing all this.

210
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,709
Why?

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why are they doing which they are not supposed to do?

212
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,542
I think is the intellect.

213
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,041
Their intellect which is also,

214
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:23,834
I should say is the brain, which is the seat of Virat.

215
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,417
Can you imagine? Is the seat of Virat.

216
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,625
And with their intellect, what do they do?

217
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,834
They say it is natural.

218
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,542
It is natural to be adharmic.

219
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,875
It is natural to be aggressive.

220
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,041
It is natural to be money oriented.

221
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:50,291
Everything that they have is all natural

222
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,999
because according to them

223
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:59,959
with their intellect they have somehow or other managed

224
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,125
to convince through your rationality

225
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,291
that this is the correct thing to do.

226
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,041
Without this you cannot exist.

227
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,291
I mean this is supposed to be their culture now.

228
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,999
Now if that is the culture all over,

229
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,625
it's not only in America all over,

230
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
this sort of a nonsensical culture

231
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,834
is accepted because of the intellect.

232
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,125
They are much more intelligent.

233
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,500
You see a person who always thinks of money, this, that,

234
00:17:29,834 --> 00:17:31,166
naturally becomes very intelligent

235
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,375
in the sense he becomes sharp.

236
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,709
He becomes smart.

237
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,834
He becomes smart, smart in a way,

238
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,500
something as if he knows everything.

239
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,875
He starts thinking he knows everything,

240
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,875
whatever he's doing he is right,

241
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,375
whatever the way he is behaving he is right.

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,291
So, these Pandavas which he has got within himself,

243
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,125
these elements that he has got,

244
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,959
he uses them for a purpose

245
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,709
which is destructive,

246
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,750
absolutely destructive - anti God.

247
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,959
And he is not aware

248
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,166
because his intelligence always justifies.

249
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,375
Whatever he's doing is justified.

250
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:23,625
And He has given also so much of brains to these intellectuals

251
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:28,709
that they also try to go against what is dharma.

252
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,417
For example, even Shri Krishna's life

253
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,959
they try to depict by saying

254
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,083
that Shri Krishna Himself had five wives

255
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,834
and He had sixteen wives later on.

256
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,166
Actually these were His power.

257
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,999
But without understanding what Shri Krishna was,

258
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,750
because intellect is such a gross nonsense

259
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:59,166
that it doesn't take you to the right thinking;

260
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,417
always to the wrong thinking,

261
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,709
it moves you because you want to justify

262
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,959
everything and this justification

263
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,542
makes you live with yourself.

264
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,500
Otherwise, normally,

265
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,542
you can't live with yourself.

266
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,667
It is very difficult to live

267
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,750
with a life which is adharmic,

268
00:19:21,999 --> 00:19:23,041
which is aggressive,

269
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,458
which is, what you can call,

270
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,792
a war mongering type.

271
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,750
But they live.

272
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,250
So, all that is expected of a human being,

273
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,166
just the opposite of that,

274
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,959
juxtaposition of that,

275
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,959
is being done in all these western cultures.

276
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,333
You can see it clearly how they justify.

277
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,792
Immorality they can justify.

278
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,041
One Mr. Freud came in.

279
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,417
He replaced even Christ.

280
00:19:56,959 --> 00:20:00,166
Of course, I mean, he had to because Christ was even more

281
00:20:00,417 --> 00:20:02,041
strict than Mohammed sahib

282
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,208
who said anybody does anything with one eye,

283
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,667
with the eyes, he should take out one eye,

284
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,667
and anybody who's hand is spoiling him should,

285
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,291
he should cut his hand.

286
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,208
I mean most of the Europeans and Americans

287
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,625
would have been without one hand I think,

288
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,166
according to Christ.

289
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,500
Thank God they didn't follow Him to that point.

290
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:31,083
And, also Mohammed sahib thought

291
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,542
that Christ has done so much for the men,

292
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,625
why not we do something for the women also,

293
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
so He made something for women.

294
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,542
Both of them are too much for human beings.

295
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,083
They didn't realize it.

296
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,625
Who's going to take out one eye for that?

297
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,291
They have intellect.

298
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,208
Now, if they are looking at many women,

299
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,542
there's a justification - is natural.

300
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,750
Have you seen any animal behaving like that

301
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,792
if the animals are natural beings?

302
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,999
We are worse than animals.

303
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:09,959
And what a mess we have created with this kind of understanding

304
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,667
through these intellectuals

305
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:18,208
who are trying to tell us something, and we accept.

306
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,625
So this is one of the problems

307
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:25,959
is if there's an intelligent man, he dominates.

308
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,291
Now, for example, some fashion starts.

309
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,667
We all take it.

310
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,166
It's a fashion.

311
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,959
But why are you taking it? It's a fashion.

312
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:44,625
So, the intellect of an entrepreneur

313
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,417
can really befool you completely.

314
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,166
But not with people who are wise.

315
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,667
They will say, "Get lost, we have had all this."

316
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,999
This is about morality part.

317
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:07,542
That is the worst practiced in the West,

318
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,417
and worse than animals I should say.

319
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:12,959
And that's how they are suffering today.

320
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,792
They are suffering with so many diseases,

321
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,792
so many troubles, this, that.

322
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,291
Second thing which we always justify is violence.

323
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,709
Now there is no war going on in Kurukshetra.

324
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:29,875
But you see violence everywhere.

325
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,709
In America it's terrible.

326
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,250
When my daughter went she took out all her ornaments,

327
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,709
put it with Me.

328
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,041
She said, "Mummy, I can't carry this."

329
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,250
Nothing was given to the girl.

330
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,500
All artificial things were given

331
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:46,417
because you can be killed for it.

332
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,125
I'm not saying it's only in America. It's everywhere.

333
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,750
Because everybody's guru is America.

334
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,166
It starts from America,

335
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,166
the gurudom and people just follow blindly.

336
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,709
So the violence is now entering into our films,

337
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:07,750
Indian films also, but now they have taken some objection.

338
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,417
Maybe it is too much for us.

339
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,417
But this kind of thing that

340
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,041
you can kill anybody,

341
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:20,999
so if you go on like this,

342
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,041
you see if that is the criteria of greatness

343
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,667
then Rwanda people should be placed highest

344
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,417
in the evolutionary process.

345
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:35,999
Killing somebody is not allowed. Thou shalt not kill.

346
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,083
Muslims are killing.

347
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,667
Everbody's killing everyone.

348
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:45,417
The other day they killed a very nice man in India

349
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,166
for nothing at all.

350
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,125
This idea of aggressiveness

351
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,834
ultimately takes you to the killing part.

352
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,792
You can't even create one ant.

353
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,792
How can you kill human beings like that?

354
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,834
Of course, this killing business

355
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,500
is taken to the highest limit,

356
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,208
like Hitler believed that he was top of the world.

357
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,041
This is same,

358
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,083
that you just forget what you are

359
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,125
and you start assuming through your ego

360
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,333
that you are something very great.

361
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,667
Also, in Sahaja Yoga I find recently

362
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:31,125
there are some people who are saying they're gods,

363
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,583
they're deities, everything.

364
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,000
So this ego business

365
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:43,000
is actually taking energy of your intelligence,

366
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,834
and the greatest enemy of a human being is,

367
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,208
is his intelligence, I think,

368
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,125
because it's so limited,

369
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,208
it is so conditioned,

370
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,500
and it is so arrogant,

371
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:57,000
and it is so blind.

372
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,792
Wisdom is a different thing.

373
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,125
Wisdom you don't get in colleges,

374
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,208
schools, universities, nowhere.

375
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:09,125
Where do you get it, the wisdom?

376
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,083
You get it through your Spirit,

377
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,000
which gives you a complete idea

378
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,667
as to what is right and what is wrong.

379
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:24,500
Whatever is wrong will be accepted by intellect, always.

380
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:29,500
Intellect is not wisdom one must understand.

381
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:33,792
They're two things - wisdom and intellect.

382
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:38,834
Now Krishna was known to be the diplomat.

383
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,709
He had Divine diplomacy.

384
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,583
That means what?

385
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,583
He was very intelligent,

386
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,250
no doubt. Without that you can't do.

387
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:52,750
I've met some people who are very highly placed

388
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,417
who don't have much intelligence even,

389
00:25:54,417 --> 00:26:01,667
but I have now seen that this intellect is a dangerous thing.

390
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,625
So Shri Krishna,

391
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,208
He used His intellect.

392
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,999
He is all powerful.

393
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,750
Nothing can dominate Him.

394
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:15,999
Even his intellect cannot dominate Him.

395
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,999
He used His intellect.

396
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:20,291
Difference between the two you should see.

397
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:23,375
You should be able to use your intellect

398
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,875
and not to be dominated by your intellect.

399
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:31,875
So He used His intellect by which He solved many problems.

400
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:36,999
His whole diplomacy was to use His intellect

401
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:41,166
and use it for the purpose of Divine.

402
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:44,375
All the time the Divine in Him

403
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,208
was helping Him to use His intellect.

404
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:52,750
So the difference is that we are slaves of our intellect

405
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,999
and He is the master of His intellect;

406
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,667
not only, everything.

407
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,834
His conditioning He is master,

408
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,542
His emotions He is master,

409
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,375
His body He's the master.

410
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,625
He's master of everything.

411
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,834
And when you master it you see your intellect very clearly,

412
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,542
oh, this is what it is suggesting.

413
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,250
This is not.

414
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,291
This intellect can give you very so-called positive ideas

415
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,375
that you are the lord of the whole world.

416
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,041
It's supposed to be positive.

417
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,999
Or the same intellect can give you ideas

418
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,083
that you are nothing.

419
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:40,250
This intellect plays on top of you.

420
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:44,917
Now you are not to be guided by your intellect,

421
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,792
but by your wisdom,

422
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,917
as you are Sahaja Yogis.

423
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,667
So, you have a very good instrument of feeling it-

424
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,792
through your vibrations you can make out

425
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,208
what is good and what is bad.

426
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,333
And you can see sometimes,

427
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,667
as being human beings,

428
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:06,875
there are some intellectual effects also coming in.

429
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,917
But with Sahaja Yoga you can judge,

430
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:13,000
what is this intellect telling you.

431
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,875
Because the intellect that you have has come out of what

432
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,542
is the main thing; should go to the subtle point

433
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:23,458
how this intellect has come to us.

434
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:30,417
This intellect has come to us because our brain became,

435
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,999
active very soon.

436
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,917
I've seen some children extremely intelligent,

437
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,291
but they have no wisdom.

438
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,417
If your - only the brain develops too much,

439
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,792
could be a mother is a very,

440
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,792
intelligent woman and,

441
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,083
father must be very intelligent,

442
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,917
inheritance would be great,

443
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,583
so they get it.

444
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,000
Or maybe the circumstances,

445
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,542
like if you are born in a particular country

446
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,583
you suddenly become very intelligent.

447
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:06,458
I've seen Americans, they read all the time.

448
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,000
All the time you see them reading.

449
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:09,667
Even English they read.

450
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,083
But what is the outcome of all that reading I don't know.

451
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,792
Every book they will read.

452
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,834
If you ask them what is a computer, they know the computers,

453
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,834
this thing, that thing, that thing, all the. . .

454
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,834
I don't know how to even put off my television.

455
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
If you ask them about television they will know they'll . . .

456
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,291
anything you want to know about mechanical things they will know.

457
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,458
Anything about politics they will know,

458
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,041
who's father was that and they will tell you that,

459
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,583
"No, no, no, no this is like this, this like that."

460
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:48,625
All this is avidya; is not knowledge. It is non-knowledge.

461
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,125
So they think they're very intelligent

462
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,834
because they know everything, about everything.

463
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,500
Now, with this intellect,

464
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,375
as this consciousness comes in they start creating

465
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:05,166
very intellectual ideas.

466
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,709
Especially in America I have seen

467
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,375
they have got for children

468
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,125
all kinds of funny things just to extract money.

469
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:19,667
For example, there is a golliwog or something

470
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,959
which has a birthday.

471
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:22,667
Can you imagine?

472
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,583
A birthday is there and sometimes,

473
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:32,917
you see even the, people have big parties for that.

474
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,667
Then they started, let us have birthday of the dogs,

475
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,542
so they are having birthdays of the dogs.

476
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,792
Anybody who puts ideas into them.

477
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,250
Then there are organizations

478
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:50,000
where they say, "All right, when you are going to die,

479
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,917
you tell us what suit you want to wear,

480
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,458
what tie you want to wear, what shoes, what clothes,

481
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,333
then what, in of,

482
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,542
what kind of a coffin you want to go - plastic,

483
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,917
or wood, or this and that." I mean . . .

484
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,917
So it is to be prescribed

485
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,583
to such an extent that some people say,

486
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,458
"Put us in the ice, you see, so we'll be there."

487
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,834
The worst thing, I think,

488
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,000
especially in Europe, is

489
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:25,834
that they have nicely advertised and marketed

490
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,000
the thing of going for a holiday.

491
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:36,250
So, in Italy supposing a person doesn't go to holiday,

492
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,834
he'll say, "There's a crisis in my life."

493
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,000
"What?" "I couldn't go to holiday."

494
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:43,583
Then they said you must go there,

495
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,083
tan your faces,

496
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:49,083
stay there in hotels so, so many hotels have come up.

497
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,333
Everybody has to go out.

498
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,583
Especially I was surprised

499
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,208
the whole of Milan is closed for one month.

500
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,542
Nobody you can find there.

501
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:02,999
See, I think if they all go and live in jungles

502
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:04,375
would be a better idea.

503
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,125
They will learn much more

504
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,542
than to waste their time on the seashore.

505
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,583
They're spoiling all the seashores.

506
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:14,458
They have no respect for the sea which is their Father.

507
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,542
They have no respect for each other.

508
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:22,917
The women try to slim down and to look very nice

509
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:25,250
so that they could become nude there.

510
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,375
The whole industry is so bad.

511
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,375
I mean if, somebody says would you like to come to the seashore,

512
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:32,959
I would not go.

513
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:38,875
I would hate to go to a place to see so many stupid ladies

514
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,041
in the sun busy trying to tan themselves.

515
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:47,000
Now this stupid idea how could you accept if you are intelligent?

516
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,166
There are so many ideas prevalent today,

517
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,959
mostly coming from America, I must say,

518
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:04,125
that you people follow. As I said

519
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:07,166
that America is the guru of all the Eastern,

520
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:12,959
of all our European and English and all these people.

521
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,709
Now, then another thing happens.

522
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,625
You see the atmosphere in which you live.

523
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,375
Especially in England I have noticed.

524
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,166
They may be nothing, you know.

525
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:32,041
There was a garbage cleaner who came to our house

526
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:35,250
and we had that time with us a president

527
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,000
of the Hague high court, imagine, the world high court.

528
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,583
So, I told him, "You have to clear out all these things."

529
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:47,000
"It's too much!" As usual, you see they are very,

530
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:51,166
I don't know what to say, but, stupidly proud about themselves.

531
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,917
"You don't understand." I said, "How much do you want?"

532
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,083
I gave him ten pounds.

533
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,208
In those days ten pounds was a big thing.

534
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:00,542
He said, "You don't understand the laws,

535
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,000
you see you are all Indians, niggers, this that."

536
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,208
Then this gentleman who was in our house

537
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,999
he came out and he asked him,

538
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:09,750
"Why are you shouting here?"

539
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,208
"You nigger, you don't understand any laws."

540
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:17,000
He is the chairman of the world high court

541
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,917
and this stupid Englishman talking like that.

542
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,208
The English are really, in a way,

543
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,333
they are really dumb people

544
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,166
because their intelligence never told,

545
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,458
tells them that you are nothing.

546
00:34:29,792 --> 00:34:31,166
What are you proud of?

547
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,999
Such dumb people they are.

548
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,583
I don't know it might have come frozen

549
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,583
with the cold or anything,

550
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:41,750
but they think they are very intelligent.

551
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,083
Their scholarship was all right,

552
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,417
but I was amazed that in the beginning of the scholarship

553
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:49,291
that they had, they said

554
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,667
that the black people are like beasts.

555
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,000
There are so many books written about it,

556
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:58,792
and they accepted that black people are like beasts

557
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,750
while these people were living,

558
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,417
like I don't know what,

559
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,083
at the time when Black were much more advanced.

560
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,125
So, this kind of an idea when they have I see here also.

561
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:17,542
I can see this that English have,

562
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,709
they think no end of themselves.

563
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,792
But they don't understand they don't know anything.

564
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,208
They have no wisdom.

565
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,083
They lived in India for 300 years.

566
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,542
They never learned anything from India.

567
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,000
Can you imagine their wisdom part?

568
00:35:37,542 --> 00:35:38,999
Their scholarship,

569
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,417
some of them,

570
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:42,417
but still ambiguous.

571
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,250
Say Bernard Shaw I think was very ambiguous.

572
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,250
I place him as a very great writer, but ambiguous.

573
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:53,000
And then comes the French, God save.

574
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:58,458
Now how have they denied Shri Krishna

575
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:03,542
you can see very clearly in French people.

576
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:08,917
French wanted to become the highest in diplomacy.

577
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,333
They lack diplomacy completely. Useless people.

578
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,208
They made our telephone in India the way they have spoiled it.

579
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:21,125
So, they started a cult of drinking.

580
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:24,709
Now can you imagine Shri Krishna drinking all these things?

581
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,999
They have a dictionary on drinking on, everything.

582
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,792
There's books after books written.

583
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,999
I mean you imagine how could any evolved people

584
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,208
accept this kind of a nonsensical culture

585
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,458
that you must know what to drink,

586
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,375
what to buy, what to put in,

587
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:45,250
what sort of a tumblers to be put?

588
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,542
They are all tumblers, nothing but tumblers I think.

589
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,458
How could they accept such a thing

590
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:56,208
which is so stupid, is a social acceptance?

591
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,792
Prostitution is another social acceptance.

592
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:05,333
Morality-wise they have really denied completely

593
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,583
the principal of Shri Krishna.

594
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:15,999
The way they have been ruining their people

595
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,917
and to beat up everything is racialism.

596
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:29,667
Can you think that for the skin you separate people?

597
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,125
On the contrary I would say the Black,

598
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,458
especially in India; they're much more evolved

599
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,999
than all the white skins put together,

600
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,667
because they have wisdom.

601
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:44,208
They are wiser people.

602
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:46,709
But these white skins,

603
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,709
they are going to - I mean,

604
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,583
how did they get America also?

605
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,750
They dominated so much, they conquered it,

606
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,291
they settled down there.

607
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,834
You saw yesterday, from Sierra Nevada you saw

608
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:03,875
how people believed in wisdom and how they lived.

609
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,750
They took away all their lands.

610
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,625
Everybody, you see, is now nicely the owner of America.

611
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,041
How? You are squatters.

612
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,458
You came from another country,

613
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,375
killed thousands and thousands of people

614
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,000
without feeling guilty about it.

615
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,625
That means they are not even human beings.

616
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:28,375
And nicely settled as Americans.

617
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,625
I don't know how this word 'America' has come,

618
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,959
but if it means "amar" they are not.

619
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:43,291
It means "a mericas" they are not.

620
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,750
Both ways I don't know how this word has come

621
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,417
and some sort of a, uh, meaning they attach to it,

622
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:56,834
but their intellect grew much more.

623
00:38:57,125 --> 00:39:00,834
Why? Again, because of money orientation.

624
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't understand economics

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,667
and the way they have made this economics from their,

626
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:10,542
yarns which came out of their heads

627
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,083
has landed all the countries into recession,

628
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,917
all kinds of fraud and also mafia.

629
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:20,917
That is the outcome of this so-called economics they have.

630
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,333
Sahaj economics is very different.

631
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:30,250
We are not bound by all these nonsensical ideas

632
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:34,000
that are prevalent as economics.

633
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,834
Is nothing but exploitation.

634
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,834
Is marketing.

635
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,458
Is how to impress people,

636
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:41,834
how to sell things,

637
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,333
how to do this, how to do that.

638
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,667
All this is nothing but, I would say,

639
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:50,083
financial aggressiveness.

640
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,125
What about Shri Krishna?

641
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,999
He was the king and He lived like a king.

642
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:07,125
But also, He lived in a very humble abode

643
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,458
in Gokul.

644
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:14,417
He was not attached.

645
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:21,542
So the first thing is that the way they're attached to money,

646
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:27,667
any justification for getting money is all right.

647
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,083
Once we went to a hotel in India.

648
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,417
So we had some American friends

649
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,166
and as usual, I mean, you can't eat like Americans can,

650
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,542
you know. Is, Indians can't compete.

651
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,834
Can eat a lot.

652
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,250
So they were eating, eating, eating and,

653
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,834
but we couldn't cope with them, really, to be very frank,

654
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:49,625
I mean, we're no good.

655
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:54,750
After some time they said, "Have you finished?" I said, "Yes."

656
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,875
"All right..." they called the waiter,

657
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,166
"Pack this out." I said, "What?

658
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,375
Want to pack this for what?" "We paid for it."

659
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,709
"So you paid for it, but I mean...In India nobody will eat a food

660
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,709
which somebody else has eaten."

661
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:10,375
"No, you pack it."

662
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,542
And they had no shame about it;

663
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,999
so shameless. I said.

664
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:16,750
"We don't do this in India."

665
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,875
Said, "Why not?" I said,. "These are bad manners."

666
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,417
"But we've paid for it.

667
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,291
Once you've paid for it then there is no bad manners."

668
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,417
I said, "Ah, we don't want this to pack."

669
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,417
"We'll have it. We'll have it in the night.

670
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,166
We'll have it in the evening."

671
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:34,500
I was surprised that such miserly people

672
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,542
are saying that they are very rich

673
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,875
and they think no end of themselves; extremely miserly.

674
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,999
Americans are superficially nice, I must tell you.

675
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:47,875
On my experience is they are not like English

676
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,041
that they look down upon everyone.

677
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,667
No you don't feel that way with them.

678
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:55,500
But they are very superficial.

679
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,875
You give them ten presents; they won't even give you one.

680
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,709
They have no sense at all; no shame about it.

681
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:09,959
Why? Because the whole thing is, 'we paid for it'.

682
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,875
I mean you go to any place,

683
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:18,542
any restaurant there or anything, you'll be amazed.

684
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,375
They pack things for you

685
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,709
if something is left over in America.

686
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:24,875
They do.

687
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:30,417
To that extent they can go in their miserliness

688
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,875
without any shame about it.

689
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,667
And miserliness is out of Sahaja Yoga.

690
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,041
You cannot be miserly.

691
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,417
You have to be generous.

692
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,709
You have to be giving.

693
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,625
You have to feel for others.

694
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,542
Is this the only way we can express ourselves.

695
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,625
All this generosity

696
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,542
is not to create a big sort of a hero out of you.

697
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:02,041
But the worst and the worst and the worst is the Hollywood.

698
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,041
Is the film industry.

699
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:12,417
Under the name of industry you can do anything.

700
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,542
Now this Hollywood is creating such horrible films,

701
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:27,041
but the worst is that they get awards for these worst films.

702
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:31,125
There's one film they showed, I've not seen, I can't see it.

703
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,834
They told Me that a man is a cannibal

704
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,709
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

705
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:41,417
and they have shown but they enjoy.

706
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,709
Very, very famous. Apart from that,

707
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,166
not only famous, but they got awards for the best film,

708
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:51,834
the best actor, the best...

709
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:55,375
You must get a director from there

710
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,375
and make him eat the flesh of human beings.

711
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,834
It's the only way, I think this horrible thing...

712
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:04,041
Then they are producing other pictures.

713
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,291
I've seen another one for a short time

714
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:10,417
where they shows all dead bodies hanging you see.

715
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,875
Horrible!

716
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:18,291
Why these people like to see such horrible things?

717
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:21,166
What is their character?

718
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:23,709
Where have they gone?

719
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:28,625
Why do they enjoy things which no human being

720
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,999
who is a human being will enjoy?

721
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:37,166
And then it goes further.

722
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:39,542
Their halloween business - I saw a film,

723
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:42,834
I said, "My God." This is a hell in which

724
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:47,500
they thought it was like the wrath of Shri Krishna.

725
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:51,041
So it was Krishna consciousness I think

726
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,750
that was working there.

727
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:57,709
There are thousand and one things which can shock you in America,

728
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:02,750
and also in England, also in Europe.

729
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:08,041
I thought Austria was something better,

730
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,000
but in Austria when you walk on the road

731
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,250
in the night after the program

732
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,125
you must take darshan of many horrible women there on the way.

733
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,959
I mean this is no where...

734
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,583
you know they're, we're forced into it.

735
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,041
And they can't do anything about it

736
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,125
as if it's a matter of right, you see,

737
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,417
what you call that of human right

738
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,583
to see such women,

739
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:37,417
and human right for these women to be on the street.

740
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:40,999
All horrible things are happening around,

741
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,583
so Sahaja Yogis have to equip themselves much more

742
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,583
with a Shri Krishna's principle.

743
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:50,291
The first principle is communication.

744
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,500
First principle is how you communicate with others.

745
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:58,500
Start it at home with your children,

746
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,750
with your wife, with your husband,

747
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,041
how you communicate.

748
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,125
Are you gentle?

749
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,834
Are you kind?

750
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,834
Are you dominating, aggressive?

751
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,291
Just try to find out.

752
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,875
It can go to any limit this aggressiveness,

753
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,125
either of the women or of the men.

754
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:25,625
Here more women I must say, I'm sorry to say.

755
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:29,125
But in my experience I've seen the women are very dominating.

756
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:31,875
In India men are extremely dominating,

757
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:35,041
but here I find the women are.

758
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,834
Now the basics

759
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:49,125
as human beings should have good manners.

760
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,875
I don't find good manners,

761
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:57,250
except that they wear good dresses, maybe the...

762
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:01,500
they might be wearing those special type of dresses and all that.

763
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,250
All manners are in dresses,

764
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:09,709
but when there are people together

765
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,583
they talk nothing but scandal.

766
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:18,834
I mean, unbearably, horrible scandals they discuss.

767
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:24,500
This is something one has to understand

768
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,458
that Shri Krishna never talked of scandals.

769
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,417
How can this, the country of Shri Krishna

770
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:37,125
and all other these European countries

771
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:43,750
are just very equipped with all the scandals of the world?

772
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,583
I just can't understand what is the interest

773
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,709
people have in the scandals.

774
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,417
So to top it all is your media

775
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:57,875
which is absolutely anti Shri Krishna

776
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,500
because they have to make money.

777
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,625
It's such a hand in glove business

778
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,500
that the people like to hear all this nonsense,

779
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,750
so they have scandals in the newspaper.

780
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,166
At least about thirty years back

781
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,000
you could never hear such a thing

782
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,959
and all such books were completely banned.

783
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:28,875
And now, suddenly, the whole thing has flowered so well

784
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,500
that any magazine, anything you take,

785
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:36,000
and you can't understand

786
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,625
what are they preaching.

787
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:43,375
They are preaching the cult of destruction completely.

788
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,500
And people take it, and like it, and work it out.

789
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,000
They are using the women for their own purpose

790
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,709
and stupidly women accept it.

791
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,083
Of course they dominate,

792
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,959
on one side feel very happy that they are dominating.

793
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:06,208
There was a lady who was boasting in one magazine

794
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:09,041
that she has had four hundred men in her life.

795
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,000
Can you imagine?

796
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,999
Now there is no place for hell for such a woman even.

797
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,792
Where will you put such a woman there?

798
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:22,166
Now I don't know; that's another problem.

799
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,667
So this movement,

800
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:39,000
which is absolutely against the principle of dharma

801
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:42,083
and of communication.

802
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:46,000
Now how you must communicate

803
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,834
decently,

804
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,834
with very tender

805
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:57,125
and very beautiful mannerism

806
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:01,333
you have to talk to another person,

807
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,083
talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

808
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,250
talk to anyone,

809
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,917
is in a very sweet manner you should talk.

810
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:13,166
I do not mean the French style, you see,

811
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:17,291
bending your body and all artificial stuff. Not that.

812
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:22,375
I'm saying that if you are naturally talking to somebody,

813
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,375
you should talk with decent language,

814
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,500
with decency, with humility

815
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:35,041
and need not go on jabbering all the time

816
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:37,625
and talking too much. There's no need.

817
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:40,250
But, on the contrary,

818
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,959
this was the style was Shri Krishna.

819
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,125
In short, His power was madhurya;

820
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,500
is the sweetness, like the honey.

821
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:54,959
When you are worshiping Shri Krishna

822
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:57,834
you have to know that you must talk

823
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:02,875
in a manner that will please another person.

824
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:23,709
So, while talking to anyone

825
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:26,125
you can talk very sweetly,

826
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:31,625
very nicely and in a way which will please that person,

827
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:33,125
not to provoke,

828
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,709
not to say things which are hard.

829
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,166
But some people have a habit

830
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:43,250
of saying all the time something which is very provoking,

831
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,583
which is not at all good.

832
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:50,583
But some people are,

833
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:56,166
when it comes to their business are very sweet,

834
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:00,709
but when it comes to something else they are very harsh.

835
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:03,750
We have a Jain community in India.

836
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,750
I've seen many Jains.

837
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,375
When they are for their business

838
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,625
they're the sweetest you could know,

839
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:16,959
but when it comes to something else

840
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,125
like donating some money or something,

841
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,959
they're extremely hard.

842
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:26,125
They will only donate for stupid things,

843
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,166
but not for something sensible.

844
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,709
They'll work for something extremely stupid,

845
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,834
but never for anything sensible.

846
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:39,458
We have another community called as Sindhis.

847
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,166
I think they are under the influence of the West.

848
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,917
Same with the Western people.

849
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:48,999
If you show that you have some business with them,

850
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:52,166
suddenly you know, they change.

851
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:54,875
Suddenly they change. You can't understand

852
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,041
what has happened to this man.

853
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,083
Or, if they find out you are something in life, they change.

854
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:05,500
Shri Krishna was just the other way round.

855
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:12,750
In His lifetime, He was always a guest of Vidhura

856
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:20,458
who was the son of a Dhasi, is the servant.

857
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:24,667
Maidservant's son was Vidhura, but he was a realized soul.

858
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:28,208
So He used to go to his house,

859
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:32,166
stay in his house, a very humble abode, Vidhura's,

860
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,208
and eat food there, very simple food.

861
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:40,500
But He would not go to the palace of Duryodhana.

862
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,166
The other way round.

863
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,291
I mean, somebody thinks that you have a palace,

864
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,750
they'll be extremely kind to you, very nice, you know.

865
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:54,542
But they say he lives in a hut, then he's nothing.

866
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:59,542
It's such a money orientation in subtle way.

867
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,917
Shri Krishna never, never cared for money

868
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,750
and never bothered about it.

869
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:10,083
You can see His case

870
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:15,750
in which He has shown complete detachment

871
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:20,208
about His throne, or His kingdom,

872
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,667
or money part of it.

873
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:28,500
Once you are attached you have all the pangs of money.

874
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,291
Naturally, if you are catching hold of a snake

875
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:35,542
you'll always be having the pangs of the snake, don't you?

876
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:38,083
But supposing you are detached.

877
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:41,875
Then the same money you can use.

878
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,999
Once you become slave of that money,

879
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:48,792
that money sits on your head.

880
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:53,999
Now, you know very well that to have money

881
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,417
also is dangerous these days.

882
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:00,417
The whole reaction is building up

883
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,959
and this is where the whole

884
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,166
all the elements are reacting against you.

885
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:11,417
You have seen the wisdom of these people from Sierra Nevada,

886
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,792
and what they said is true

887
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:23,083
that when we try to acquire more money,

888
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,417
go on acquiring, go on acquiring

889
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:31,333
and getting a idea in our head,

890
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,999
then there are looters who come round.

891
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,125
I think the worst are those

892
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:42,417
who have got names as entrepreneurs.

893
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:44,999
For example, they'll say, "Now,

894
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,917
if you have a designer's watch",

895
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,417
then everybody ran for designer's watches.

896
00:55:58,417 --> 00:56:03,542
The other day I went to Italy, no, to Istanbul

897
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:07,208
and I found out that the T-shirts are made there

898
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:10,583
and sold in France as if they are French. They are not.

899
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:17,667
They are A to Z, they are made in there, which is Istanbul

900
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,917
and the name is on that Lacoste,

901
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,000
this that and all that.

902
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,083
And people pay any amount, but not in Turkey.

903
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:31,208
Whatever surplus is left we can get it for seven pounds.

904
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:36,542
Now the stupidity is that they can befool you.

905
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,667
Pierre Cardin, then there's another one,

906
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:45,917
I don't know, Armani - that's in Italy only,

907
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,458
but in America there are many.

908
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:51,458
Even, I mean, they come to you,

909
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:52,834
to your house.

910
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:54,583
England is much worse.

911
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:56,250
They're so unmannerly,

912
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,375
they'll come to your house for dinner

913
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:02,375
and they'll turn the plate to see where it is made.

914
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,375
Really. Openly.

915
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:09,667
And they'll discuss from where the cutlery has come.

916
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:16,583
So, though they think they're very rich,

917
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:20,458
stupidly they are being exploited by this kind of a nonsense

918
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,542
that you have this watch, you have this thing.

919
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:28,458
Now, in England we have something called Saville Row,

920
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,834
so that they put it outside, you know,

921
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,542
outside the coat - Saville Row.

922
00:57:34,542 --> 00:57:36,583
Can you imagine?

923
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,458
Branded.

924
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:43,333
See, everything is made into a big ado.

925
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,999
So on one side they are very intelligent

926
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,375
to understand this is the business,

927
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:52,000
this is the fashion all that.

928
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:55,083
The other side they don't know they are fools,

929
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,792
being befooled all the time by saying

930
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
this is the special thing, that is the special thing

931
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:05,125
and that it has a name and it has, what you call,

932
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:09,667
the - a great organization behind it.

933
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,458
Sahaja Yogis should understand this is all befooling

934
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:19,250
and stupid thing and they wear,

935
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:21,999
all of them will wear like that just to show off.

936
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,583
What is it?

937
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:28,333
Why should this impress anyone?

938
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:30,709
Think of it.

939
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:34,834
Now, intelligently think why should it impress you,

940
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,917
these befooling things that are going on?

941
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,125
Nothing special.

942
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,458
They are just the same.

943
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:46,208
They told Me in Istanbul that they make ordinary ones

944
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,792
and then they put on top of this mark

945
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:52,458
and the ordinary ones are for, say,

946
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:56,583
six dollars, so with this thing is for seven dollars.

947
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,999
There's nothing special,

948
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:06,125
but this special trickery, I think,

949
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:10,583
is coming from England and America especially

950
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,709
maybe also from France, but France are, you know,

951
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:17,208
queer people.

952
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:20,792
Now they have something. I showed them today -

953
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:24,458
So stupidly made thing,

954
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:27,917
which cost five hundred pounds,

955
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:32,250
but people accept because they have no wisdom.

956
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:37,333
Now see the difference between the intelligence and wisdom.

957
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,709
Why to show off, first of all

958
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,542
and to show off something which has no meaning?

959
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:51,542
It cost only one dollar in Turkey to put that thing on

960
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:54,583
and stupidly people are showing it.

961
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:04,125
Is it that we have intelligence,

962
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:07,458
but which has no divine power?

963
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:11,333
Anybody can befool you to do what you like.

964
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,709
Now six inches of skirt started.

965
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,542
All right, everywhere six inches.

966
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:18,667
You couldn't get one with the seven inches even.

967
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,000
That's not in the fashion.

968
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,208
That's not in - means 'in' in madhouse?

969
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:31,709
Now just look at Shri Krishna's style - so wise,

970
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,333
witnessing everything,

971
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:36,709
how He plays around

972
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:40,458
and how He wins over.

973
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,583
Now, supposing He was attached.

974
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:46,333
He could not have done it.

975
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:51,917
So to get over this, first of all, you detach yourself from this

976
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,999
anti-Shri Krishna culture.

977
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:57,125
It's very important.

978
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,834
This is the fashion. That is the fashion.

979
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:06,333
And all these fashions are extremely, extremely destructive.

980
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:09,333
Now, not to put oil in the hair

981
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,208
and end up with bald heads. All right.

982
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,542
Then there are specialists, you see,

983
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:19,583
again designers who make wigs, designer's wig.

984
01:01:19,834 --> 01:01:23,125
So you carry a wig on your head and write it down, 'designer's.'

985
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:30,333
My idea is to see

986
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:36,250
how stupid human beings can become with their intellect.

987
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:42,999
Today I don't want to describe the qualities of Shri Krishna

988
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,125
because you know them.

989
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:49,125
But how you people have gone away,

990
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:55,083
in the West, from Shri Krishna's styles,

991
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,125
His methods.

992
01:01:57,709 --> 01:02:00,709
Whatever He did was to destroy the evil,

993
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,875
to destroy the negativity

994
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:06,917
and to bring forth the joy,

995
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:11,999
which is Ras, He started. "Ras" - Ra is energy with that.

996
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,125
The Ras is the energy,

997
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:18,999
which you have

998
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:22,709
and that's how you play the Ras,

999
01:02:22,999 --> 01:02:24,917
with that energy and enjoy.

1000
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,583
He brought it Holi.

1001
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,542
Of course now "Holi" can be anything,

1002
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:34,417
but very sensible Holy he brought just to express your joy

1003
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,083
in mirthful, playful ways,

1004
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:41,125
because that was lacking in Shri Rama's life.

1005
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:44,917
So He said just allow yourself to enjoy,

1006
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:49,250
but this was only for Sahaja Yogis.

1007
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,583
Not for others.

1008
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:55,834
Others, you know that they go to the pubs

1009
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:58,667
and what happens. We have a certificate here that

1010
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:02,583
we are very peaceful, very good people, this and that.

1011
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:05,417
This is what Shri Krishna said

1012
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,417
and has done,

1013
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,709
that we have to enjoy everything,

1014
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,417
but in a dharmic way.

1015
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,291
We should not be adharmic.

1016
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,625
The Dharma should give you Joy.

1017
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:22,417
Otherwise, if you are dharmic, you know what happens,

1018
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:25,041
that you become absolutely austere,

1019
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,542
person, joyless person

1020
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:34,542
and sometimes cynical

1021
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:37,750
because you think others are adharmic and this and that.

1022
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,875
But Shri Krishna's ways were that you should be mirthful,

1023
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:43,542
you should be joyful

1024
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:46,875
and this joy will communicate with others.

1025
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,959
Without this joyous nature you cannot be communicator.

1026
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,750
But, as you know, when I went to French,

1027
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,834
they told Me, "Mother, you look so joyous,

1028
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,875
you should tell you are miserable."

1029
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,667
I said, "But I am not."

1030
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,999
"If you don't tell, then they won't believe you."

1031
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,083
I said, "Why?" "Because they are all miserable

1032
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,500
and they think they are very unhappy people."

1033
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:14,625
So I started my lecture with "Les Miserables"

1034
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:19,625
and I told them that at every fourth lamppost

1035
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:24,375
you find a prostitute and every tenth one a pub.

1036
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:30,375
And I see so many people sitting on the pavement,

1037
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,834
so I asked them, "Why are they sitting here?"

1038
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:35,041
Said, "They are waiting the whole world to be destroyed."

1039
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:38,959
I said, "Really?" After drinking, these ideas come in,

1040
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,792
that let the whole world be destroyed

1041
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:43,875
because maybe they don't have any more money to go to pubs.

1042
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,625
I don't know why.

1043
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,500
Now, think their level,

1044
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:52,166
just think of their level.

1045
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:54,500
Where are they

1046
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,500
compared to you all?

1047
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:03,959
So He's the one, as Virata,

1048
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,417
puts light into your brain.

1049
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:11,875
In that light you see what is stupid;

1050
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:13,959
what is unwise.

1051
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:17,041
This is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

1052
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:23,750
And He gives you the nirananda

1053
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:27,959
because if you don't have the light you cannot enjoy

1054
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:33,792
the joy of your mind

1055
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,333
or the joy of your brain.

1056
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:37,959
You cannot.

1057
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,208
And it is through His light

1058
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:44,417
that we see

1059
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:51,417
ourselves as something full of joy

1060
01:05:51,417 --> 01:05:53,999
and we don't know what to do with it

1061
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:57,750
and how to do it;

1062
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,792
how to express our joy;

1063
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,625
how to express our feelings.

1064
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,166
Because it's too much.

1065
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:08,792
This another fashion to say, "It's too much."

1066
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:12,542
Anything you tell them," Mother,it is too much."

1067
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:15,583
Because the brain is full of nonsense,

1068
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:18,250
so you tell them anything, nothing can go in their heads.

1069
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,125
"It's too much."

1070
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:24,458
So the wise person,

1071
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,208
as Shri Krishna is,

1072
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:29,542
wisest of wise,

1073
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,125
He's the source of wisdom,

1074
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:35,250
has to be Stitha Pragya.

1075
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,999
Means he has to be in balance,

1076
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,583
he has to be in dharma

1077
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:48,792
and, above that,

1078
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:52,000
he has to be in Joy.

1079
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,250
Now, you are not only in joy, but you know the truth.

1080
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,417
You know the absolute truth.

1081
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:03,834
And this absolute truth

1082
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:08,667
is the one that makes you understand

1083
01:07:09,709 --> 01:07:13,542
what is right, what is wrong and you develop your wisdom,

1084
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,333
not your intellect so much.

1085
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,834
You then see your intellect misbehaving sometimes,

1086
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,417
telling you negative ideas,

1087
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:23,709
sometimes too much of aggressive ideas.

1088
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:26,792
You can become a witness, "sakshi",

1089
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,375
and that's why Shri Krishna has said,

1090
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,250
"I am the sakshi of the whole world,

1091
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,583
the witness of the whole world."

1092
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:36,709
See, you can go on talking about Him,

1093
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:41,041
but what we have to see, where are we going wrong

1094
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,834
and how can Shri Krishna save us?

1095
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:48,917
Not by singing, "Hari Rama, Hari Krishna", like that.

1096
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:56,250
By becoming, day by day, wiser person.

1097
01:07:58,709 --> 01:08:04,959
Wisdom gives you definite ideas as to how you have to be.

1098
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:08,458
If there is still this thing going on.

1099
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:11,750
See, in the Western way they show like this.

1100
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:13,083
Ask them, "How are you?"

1101
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:15,291
"I'm like this." Means what?

1102
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:17,417
"Like this."

1103
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:19,417
If that is still there,

1104
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:21,875
then Shri Krishna is not awakened,

1105
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:26,959
but if it is that you know what it is,

1106
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,083
you'll have the same smile as Shri Krishna had.

1107
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:35,208
I know. I know that.

1108
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:40,792
Now we have to understand that our Vishuddhi

1109
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,959
has to be all right.

1110
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,959
I get Vishuddhi because I know what it is.

1111
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,291
This is America, should be all right,

1112
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:50,542
otherwise My Vishuddhi will never be all right. I think so.

1113
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:53,667
But for Vishuddhi,

1114
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,333
there are so many things we have in Sahaja Yoga

1115
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:58,542
which very few people do.

1116
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,333
At least if you Sahaja Yogis keep your Vishuddhi all right,

1117
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,667
I'll be much better off.

1118
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,875
But you never try to keep your Vishuddhi all right.

1119
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,166
Continue with it. Continue with it.

1120
01:09:09,417 --> 01:09:10,875
Even the president of America

1121
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:14,166
has the worst Vishuddhi I've ever seen,

1122
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,999
so you can imagine what good is he going to do.

1123
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:21,500
What wisdom will he have?

1124
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:26,083
Now you are a new race,

1125
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:30,166
blessed by the Divine,

1126
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,625
and you have Shri Krishna within yourself awakened.

1127
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:39,083
In His own glory, in His own light,

1128
01:09:39,999 --> 01:09:42,750
you should know what is to be done.

1129
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,333
One must communicate.

1130
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,083
That you have to do,

1131
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,667
but what I've seen that people don't even meditate.

1132
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:53,208
Even if they meditate,

1133
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,792
they don't want to communicate.

1134
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,875
And sometimes when they communicate,

1135
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,417
they think they have become Gods.

1136
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,041
It's very difficult.

1137
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:05,417
Human beings is very

1138
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,792
difficult commodity to handle.

1139
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:14,208
You have to communicate with complete humility

1140
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,750
the way Shri Krishna did.

1141
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:19,333
In His ras,

1142
01:10:19,667 --> 01:10:22,625
He spread the energy of Radha

1143
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,625
into all these people by holding hands.

1144
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,750
So His childhood where He killed so many people

1145
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:33,291
and did all that is over.

1146
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,208
Then even His adulthood,

1147
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,291
where He had to kill His own uncle, is also over.

1148
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:43,166
So He becomes the king.

1149
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:48,417
When He becomes the king then what does He do?

1150
01:10:48,667 --> 01:10:50,542
Is to communicate.

1151
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:52,500
Most of His,

1152
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,542
expressions of His qualities

1153
01:10:56,542 --> 01:11:00,166
are seen after He became the king.

1154
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:03,083
Before that He was busy killing,

1155
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,875
one after another, all these horrible people.

1156
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,625
After that He built,

1157
01:11:09,417 --> 01:11:10,542
built up people.

1158
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:13,291
He built Dwarika and

1159
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:17,667
He tried to communicate

1160
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,542
with people.

1161
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,542
Now your duty is to build up yourself

1162
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,667
and to communicate with others

1163
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:30,166
with all the sweetness, madhurya of Shri Krishna,

1164
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,792
all the beauty of Shri Krishna,

1165
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,667
with full understanding

1166
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,875
as to what stupid things are going round and around.

1167
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,417
Once you understand that,

1168
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,625
you'll not take it because you will become wise

1169
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:48,792
enough not to take to all these nonsensical things

1170
01:11:49,083 --> 01:11:50,500
that are going on.

1171
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,750
And it is so much,

1172
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,208
I mean, I, in this lecture, I cannot tell you,

1173
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,750
but now if you become the witness of the whole thing

1174
01:11:56,999 --> 01:11:58,750
you'll see what is happening.

1175
01:11:58,999 --> 01:12:03,625
Now we have to stop them from going to Hell.

1176
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:11,166
And we have to really develop a very, very good personality

1177
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:13,542
of a Sahaja Yogi. All of you.

1178
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:16,625
Now, there are many marriages that take place,

1179
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:18,875
then suddenly they decide to divorce.

1180
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:20,792
Divorce is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,

1181
01:12:21,083 --> 01:12:23,625
but this American style of nonsense

1182
01:12:23,875 --> 01:12:25,750
I don't want to have.

1183
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:29,208
Women are can be very dominating.

1184
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,625
One fellow ran away to Russia.

1185
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,542
They have no idea of a marriage.

1186
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,041
They don't know how to work it out.

1187
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,792
All the sweetness of the marriage is finished.

1188
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:41,083
If the husband is dominating,

1189
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:42,542
the wife is dominating,

1190
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,333
this happens, then you divorce.

1191
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:47,041
What is the achievement?

1192
01:12:49,041 --> 01:12:51,041
So we have to work out

1193
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:54,166
everything within us because we are conditioned,

1194
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,917
we are in an atmosphere.

1195
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,166
I would request all of you

1196
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,500
to try to understand these subtleties

1197
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,333
of Shri Krishna's personality.

1198
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:07,417
Try to become like that

1199
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,166
extremely peaceful,

1200
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:14,333
extremely kind, tender, helpful.

1201
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,083
And in humility,

1202
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:19,500
He had no consciousness of money.

1203
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,750
Nothing.

1204
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:25,291
And also, as you know, He was a dark person

1205
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:29,959
for some reason,

1206
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:34,041
but the way He led his life

1207
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:36,291
should be an example for us.

1208
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:42,875
I'm sure, now, when you go back to your countries

1209
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,750
you'll see all this nonsense.

1210
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,291
Please note it down.

1211
01:13:46,542 --> 01:13:49,083
Write it down what these nonsensical people are doing

1212
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:51,208
and send it over to Me.

1213
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,792
That's what it is.

1214
01:13:53,792 --> 01:13:57,083
So today is the puja of Shri Krishna.

1215
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,875
I need not tell you how many qualities He has, as I told you,

1216
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:04,500
but the greatest quality He has that

1217
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:09,333
He is the doctor of doctors.

1218
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:16,542
Now, in His name you will know how many qualities He has

1219
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,208
and you will understand.

1220
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,667
Try to understand that

1221
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:23,208
we have to have these qualities within us also.

1222
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,750
Whatever qualities are described or said,

1223
01:14:25,999 --> 01:14:28,333
try to see how many we have.

1224
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:31,875
That's the way the introspection will start.

1225
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,083
Once you start introspecting yourself

1226
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,083
and understanding yourself,

1227
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:39,500
the wisdom will grow - not by seeing faults in others,

1228
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,999
putting blames on others, but on yourself.

1229
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:46,166
That is how the things will work out.

1230
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,500
Though Krishna didn't have to do that because

1231
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,875
He was Sampurna, He was complete.

1232
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,583
But we have to do all this

1233
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:55,375
to see that we also become complete.

1234
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:56,959
Thank you very much.

1235
01:14:57,959 --> 01:15:00,041
May God bless you all.

1236
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:09,750
May God bless you.

1237
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:17,291
There's another point I wanted to mention about Sahaja Yogis,

1238
01:15:17,959 --> 01:15:22,750
that we introduce classical Indian music for you people,

1239
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:27,375
because I think it helps for vibrations.

1240
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:30,750
But as the nature is of western people,

1241
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:35,583
anything they take up they must go to the utilmate end

1242
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:38,458
'til they are completely lost.

1243
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:45,583
So what I find now all of them are buying tapes.

1244
01:15:46,999 --> 01:15:50,417
Some tapes ...

1245
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:09,667
Now some of them are buying tapes, I was surprised,

1246
01:16:09,667 --> 01:16:13,166
of very unknown people, just mad.

1247
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,834
Once I was traveling with a lady in America,

1248
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:20,083
was a disciple of Muktanand.

1249
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:24,417
She said, "I have a very nice tape," and she played the,

1250
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:25,999
the, lecture of Muktanand.

1251
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:30,166
Rajneesh's people will play the lecture of Rajneesh.

1252
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:33,750
But here now they've all gone to one side,

1253
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,375
so this one, that one,

1254
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:39,083
all kinds of music they have got.

1255
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:41,625
Tomorrow, we start

1256
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,999
telling you that you must understand Indian dancing,

1257
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:49,834
so all my videos will be replaced by Indian dancing

1258
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:51,542
from A to Z.

1259
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,417
You are Sahaja Yogis.

1260
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:58,959
It's all right, I am also fond of music,

1261
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,750
but it's not the way.

1262
01:17:00,999 --> 01:17:03,500
What is the main thing of your life?

1263
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:08,083
And I was surprised how people are lost in the music.

1264
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:12,959
I mean there should be some occasion.

1265
01:17:13,959 --> 01:17:17,999
They're all already in another world with the music.

1266
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,166
Don't do these things.

1267
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:22,959
You go to extremes of everything.

1268
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,667
That's not proper, even pujas, anything,

1269
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,375
you go to extremes.

1270
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:29,999
To go to extremes, you won't be in the center.

1271
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:34,875
You will not be in the place of Shri Krishna,

1272
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:37,250
where you have to be.

1273
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:39,709
On the contrary, you will be

1274
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,375
just in another imaginary world.

1275
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:50,959
So, as a matter of habit we create a world like that;

1276
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,500
somebody has music world;

1277
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,250
somebody has dancing world;

1278
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,083
another one has,

1279
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:02,417
world, I've seen with Sahaja Yogis who think

1280
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,625
no end of themselves.

1281
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:07,291
"We have a special relationship with Shri Mataji."

1282
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,959
Is a very common thing.

1283
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:11,959
But I cannot have any special relationship.

1284
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:14,166
Sorry,

1285
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:20,834
nobody has any special relationship with Me.

1286
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:24,166
This I would like to tell you very clearly,

1287
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,709
and you should not claim that,

1288
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:29,417
and then become, some people say, "we are deities."

1289
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:32,959
I mean this is something to be - horrible.

1290
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:38,041
I'll speak for two minutes in Marathi if you don't mind...

1291
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,166
Now I want to talk to the Maharashtrian girls.

1292
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,917
You have been married here,

1293
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:46,000
and have got rich husbands.

1294
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:48,458
But as soon as you came here

1295
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:51,959
you've started sending money to your parents.

1296
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,208
Does this happen in India?

1297
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:56,583
Can you send money to your parents from your in laws' house.

1298
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,875
Secondly is ornaments.

1299
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,792
You've started making a lot of ornaments.

1300
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:03,875
I asked a Sahaja yogi husband

1301
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:06,208
why don't you buy a shirt for yourself.

1302
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,250
He said, "what should I do,

1303
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,291
my wife is spending all the money on ornaments."

1304
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:15,166
This greed for ornaments does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

1305
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:22,083
This is a very serious matter.

1306
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:25,291
Recently I learnt that all the Indian ladies

1307
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:29,250
have made ornaments after marriage.

1308
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,542
Thus there is no money left with the husband.

1309
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:35,875
Those husbands who used to support Sahaja yoga before

1310
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:37,375
are unable to do so after the marriage.

1311
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:40,333
They have no money left with them.

1312
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:41,542
What has happened to you.

1313
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:44,125
you've come here from the land of saints.

1314
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:51,625
Shivaji Maharaj had a great respect for Shri Saint Tukaram

1315
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,875
and he took some ornaments for his wife.

1316
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,166
His wife must be somebody like you,

1317
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:02,291
as she immediately accepted the ornaments.

1318
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:06,250
Why should one be so much fond of ornaments?

1319
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,417
Even being a Goddess I am not fond of ornaments,

1320
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,083
then why should you be so fond of them?

1321
01:20:11,959 --> 01:20:15,333
Since they compulsorily offer me that's why I accept.

1322
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:22,625
So he gave and she accepted the ornaments,

1323
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,250
Saint Tukaram came and said,

1324
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:28,125
"What is the need to have the ornaments for saints like us?"

1325
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:32,750
So he returned back all the ornaments.

1326
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:36,542
Know that you've come here from land of saints

1327
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:40,667
and this attitude of yours is a sign of poorness.

1328
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,500
You've been sending money to your parents

1329
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:48,166
and I cannot explain to you how far this has gone.

1330
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:59,291
You've not come here to misbehave like this.

1331
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:01,458
You've come here to help Sahaja Yoga

1332
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:07,333
and not for making ornaments.

1333
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:09,542
If you do them once in a while it's all right

1334
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:15,250
but if you put all the attention on ornaments

1335
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:18,583
you might lose your husband and he might leave Sahaja Yoga.

1336
01:21:18,917 --> 01:21:21,875
This would be good deed (meant not good), you will achieve!!

1337
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:24,500
Without My permission henceforth,

1338
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:26,959
nobody should make any ornaments.

1339
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,333
We'll have the Pooja now.
