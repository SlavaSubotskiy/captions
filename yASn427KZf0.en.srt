1
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:10,193
Now regarding the Spirit,

2
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:15,916
the last and the highest thing 
that it is the source of joy.

3
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:20,672
Joy has no duality, it doesn’t have 
happiness and unhappiness.

4
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:25,026
That is the ego; when the ego 
is pampered, it feels happy,

5
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:27,974
when it is hurt it feels unhappy.

6
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:34,088
So it (the spirit) has nothing to do 
with that duality; it’s in joy.

7
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:40,386
Say a sensible man is watching a tragedy 
or a comedy as a drama he enjoys both,

8
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,876
he doesn’t get involved into it.

9
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:51,189
In the same way, you enjoy life 
without getting involved into it

10
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:57,283
and the life becomes 
a source of joyous living.

11
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:04,841
So the joy that you feel is rather late 
in the western minds,

12
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,795
(the) reason is the mind of the 
western people is over-developed,

13
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,681
and the heart is less-developed.

14
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:15,216
But say in a place where people 
are developing now,

15
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,891
they’re developing their brains now,

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,419
developing countries, 
the heart is more developed.

17
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,959
So they feel the joy first

18
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,462
and they are not bothered 
about knowing about the brain.

19
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:31,178
But the Western mind will first of all see: 
is it true or not?

20
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:34,245
Yes, it’s true, then it will go and see this fellow,

21
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:37,691
let me see the vibrations of a tree, 
of a doggy, this, that.

22
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,277
They go on analyzing everything,

23
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:43,596
see with the vibrations of this photograph, 
of this sari, of that clothes.

24
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:47,098
They go on like mad, they go on, 
first analyzing it,

25
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:51,756
then when they get out of it, 
they settle down

26
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:58,563
then they find the kundalini is fixed here 
and the source of joy starts pouring,

27
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:04,048
just like the river Ganges.
It pours actually physically.

28
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:10,503
You feel that what we call the (…?)

29
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:16,724
is the rising of the hair when you feel 
that joy falling from your head,

30
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:21,152
just like the Ganges falls on Shiva.

31
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:28,482
When you see a beautiful picture, 
say  you see a Mona Lisa, you think:

32
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,379
this Leonardo Da Vinci, 
what he must have done,

33
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:34,096
how much it will cost, this, that, 
all those things.

34
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:37,102
But a realised soul does not think, 
he just looks,

35
00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:39,581
looks at it without thinking.

36
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:46,747
The joy of the creation of that beautiful painting

37
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,001
absolutely is reflected in his mind

38
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:57,586
like in a ripple-less lake; all that 
is surrounding, it is completely reflected.

39
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:02,577
That’s how the sense of beauty 
and aesthetics change absolutely.
