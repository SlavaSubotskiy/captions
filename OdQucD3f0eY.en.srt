1
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:46,948
Yesterday, you had asked me for the status
of a Guru.

2
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:54,792
It’s a state, it is not a status

3
00:05:54,993 --> 00:06:01,388
because status is external, can be bestowed
upon anyone,

4
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:08,511
and anybody can say that, “This is
your status.”

5
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:15,555
For something external merit, or something,
you can give a status to a person.

6
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:22,009
It is a state. ‘State’ means the innate
being,

7
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:32,580
evolved to that level that you become
the master.

8
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,685
Of course,

9
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,543
you have to be your own master to begin
with. No doubt about it.

10
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:48,245
If you are not even your own master,

11
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:55,721
then how you can achieve that state?

12
00:06:56,865 --> 00:07:03,302
Now as I say it is innate; then one starts
thinking,

13
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:09,701
“If it is innate, in a Sahaj way, how do
we achieve?”

14
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:25,363
There are certain faculties which we have
to develop to begin with.

15
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:37,756
The first faculty is if we can become
thoughtless.

16
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:46,544
In meditation you can become thoughtless
for a short time.

17
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:52,803
Gradually this short time should go on
increasing –

18
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:56,368
that you are without any thought.

19
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:03,021
This happens also as we can say is a state,

20
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,608
but how do we achieve that, again?

21
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:13,959
Because human beings cannot understand
that anything can happen spontaneously,

22
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,524
it has to be done some - something has
to be done.

23
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:27,345
For that, in Sahaj, we have something
very, very simple,

24
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:36,327
that you have got a mantra as ‘nirvichar’.

25
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,912
So now you watch anything saying
the mantra,

26
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:47,663
“Twameva sakshat nirvichar,”

27
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:57,491
then you’ll start seeing that, witnessing
that, without thinking.

28
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,926
Just see, witness.

29
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:11,756
Just seeing itself creates that state
within us, the first state,

30
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:18,422
is very important, that you become
the witness, the sakshi.

31
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:28,174
As soon as you become a sakshi,

32
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:34,731
the whole thing whatever you are seeing

33
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:46,557
gives you the complete idea, subtle
as well as gross, of that thing.

34
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:51,707
You see it and you know it

35
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,027
and, as a Sahaja Yogi, it becomes
your knowledge.

36
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:05,929
We can say, in the modern terminology,
that you see something,

37
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:14,544
it gets recorded in your mind and it
manifests joy,

38
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:24,505
it manifests knowledge, it manifests
compassion, whatever may [be] the situation.

39
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:32,252
Because now you have many dimensions
which you have to develop,

40
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,979
these dimensions are to be developed.

41
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,556
Now supposing you go and meet someone
with whom you have to deal.

42
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:51,130
He’s talking, talking, talking. Just become
thoughtless.

43
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:55,122
So now, what is the thing that will happen
as soon as you become thoughtless?

44
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:59,437
First his thoughts, his bombardment,
will not touch you

45
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:02,917
because you are in a different realm
altogether.

46
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:11,906
But in that realm your power will manifest:

47
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:17,664
it may cool him down, it may shut him down

48
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:24,647
or maybe he may just feel tremendous
love for you.

49
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:35,968
So the word ‘guru’ means gravity:

50
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:40,901
that the Mother Earth has gravity.

51
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:47,908
In the same [way] a person who is a guru
has to have the gravity.

52
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,537
But how do you develop this gravity?

53
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:57,283
Some people just artificially become
very grave

54
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:03,595
and sometimes show that they are very
serious or something like that.

55
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:08,450
Gravity is within yourself.

56
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:18,347
In the second state, we should say, of guru
pada, is your gravity must manifest.

57
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:24,599
As you become the witness your gravity
starts expressing itself.

58
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,443
It will not show as temper or seriousness
or anything like that.

59
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:36,965
But it will manifest in a way that

60
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:44,077
the whole thing will become extremely
dignified and majestic.

61
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,671
It will just manifest by itself.

62
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:57,017
So the state in which you rise, now becomes
effective.

63
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,599
Before this it was not.

64
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:09,029
You had to all the time manipulate,
say this, say that.

65
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:16,998
But in your silence you can manifest
your gravity,

66
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:25,183
and this gravity is extremely… it acts like
a magnet.

67
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:28,699
As you know there’s a magnet in the Mother
Earth.

68
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,420
That we call as the gravity, by which
people are attracted.

69
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:40,366
We are resting on this Mother Earth because
of her gravity.

70
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:46,856
Everything is attracted to Mother Earth
because of her gravity.

71
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:54,898
So you get a magnetic temperament,
magnetic character,

72
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:58,514
magnetic personality.

73
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:04,572
And this magnetic personality that you
develop,

74
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:10,397
immediately shows that it is manifesting
its power.

75
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:16,401
Just try to understand. Like the light now
is coming on me:

76
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:22,298
it’s just giving light, but it is not
manifesting anything.

77
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,568
We can see the sun’s rays, is the best
example.

78
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:35,556
Sun’s rays when they fall onto the leaves,
the rays, which look simple,

79
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:41,577
manifest their power of making it
into chlorophyll.

80
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:50,006
In the same way, when you are at that
height or at that state,

81
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:57,780
then without saying anything, without doing
anything, even a glance –

82
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:06,656
you manifest. But not only that, but you
record everything.

83
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:15,358
So many people must have noticed that
I seldom forget things.

84
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:24,344
Like once I was travelling and I saw some
red stones near Sangamner.

85
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:28,873
And when I said that “Why not we have some
red stones for Pratishthana”.

86
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,848
They said, “But there are no red stones
in the whole of Maharashtra.”

87
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,259
I said, “There are.” “Where?”

88
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,552
I said, “Go on the way of - you’ll find
them near Sangamner.” They said,

89
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:42,394
“We have travelled so much that way,
we’ve never seen it.”

90
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:45,435
I said, “I don’t know what you are seeing,
you know,

91
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:48,369
what you are watching, I have definitely
seen.”

92
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,050
When they went there, they saw mountains
and mountains of these red stones,

93
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,820
and they never noticed it even.

94
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:08,080
So now, when you start witnessing something
without thought

95
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:13,312
there’s no obstruction for absorbing
the knowledge about that thing,

96
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,474
because there’s no thought.

97
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:25,145
It’s complete absorption takes place.
And then it manifests.

98
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:36,403
This is how the Divine Power works
within us.

99
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:46,503
So with our gravity

100
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:51,998
what we do is to touch that depth
within us,

101
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,826
which can carry the Divine Power and
manifest it.

102
00:16:57,027 --> 00:17:00,641
Unless and until we touch that depth
within us,

103
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:07,864
Sahaja Yoga is like ‘Hare Rama
Hare Krishna’.

104
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:16,638
Nothing better than that. And that’s why
I find so many Sahaja Yogis, sometimes,

105
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,592
really go off their rails suddenly.

106
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:28,943
Because they have no gravity to go down
into their own being

107
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:33,261
and to feel the beauty and the glory
of their own being

108
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:41,714
and to use that gravity for manifesting
Divine Power.

109
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:53,087
We could say that, supposing there is
a vehicle which is very weak,

110
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,886
which is not yet properly fixed,

111
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:04,607
cannot be used for something substantial.

112
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:11,373
And the most substantial thing in your
lives is this Divine Power;

113
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:19,901
which looks very light. You never feel
the weight of this Divine Power.

114
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:24,732
You’ll never feel the pressure of this
Divine Power.

115
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:34,113
But if you are not clean, if your channel
is not clean,

116
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:40,296
then this Divine Power cannot flow
properly, it cannot manifest.

117
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:44,922
So when we say that we are the instrument
of God Almighty,

118
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:49,195
then like this instrument we are; now we
are connected to the mains.

119
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:52,504
If this instrument is not all right

120
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:58,814
then it cannot manifest whatever it is
supposed to do.

121
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:05,833
But we are much above all these ordinary
instruments,

122
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:14,734
even the most complicated, even the most
advanced and developed by science.

123
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:22,063
Because we reach a state where we ourselves
become the science.

124
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:27,140
Science of Truth, an Absolute Truth.

125
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:35,084
So what is needed for a Guru is
self-esteem.

126
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:41,476
This is a very important point [which]
people don’t realise: the self-esteem.

127
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:47,655
To achieve the self-esteem we have
to introspect

128
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:54,436
and know that, “Today I am not what
I was before.

129
00:19:54,637 --> 00:20:01,415
I’m a realised soul. I have got powers.
Of course I have powers.

130
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:08,932
Powers of love, powers of compassion,
powers of grasping things,

131
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:20,405
powers of creativity, powers of giving
realisations to others.”

132
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,569
Nobody had these powers!

133
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,277
But somehow or other in Sahaja Yog we are
not self-conscious.

134
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:32,551
And we should not be self-conscious because
that can give you ego,

135
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:36,722
but we should have self-esteem.

136
00:20:36,923 --> 00:20:44,309
“I’m a Guru. I’m a Guru. I’m not
an ordinary person.

137
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,790
I’m not on the street. I’m something
special.

138
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:54,647
I’m on the shores of Truth.

139
00:20:54,848 --> 00:21:04,154
I have to salvage the people who are blind,
who are mad,” all kinds of things.

140
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:09,454
In a most chaotic conditions this world
is today.

141
00:21:09,655 --> 00:21:18,401
So at that time a kind of a silence will
come within you.

142
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:23,964
When there will be any such crisis,
immediately you’ll become extremely silent.

143
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,560
But this is again a state I’m telling you.

144
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:38,924
So now if there is something that makes
you upset or makes you unhappy,

145
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:47,115
try to reach that point, that axis,
which is just silence.

146
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:51,756
And this silence will make you really
powerful

147
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:56,391
because this silence is not only yours.

148
00:21:56,592 --> 00:22:02,334
When you are in that silence you are
in the silence of the cosmos,

149
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:12,845
silence of the cosmos. And the silence
of the cosmos works for you.

150
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,993
You are in connection

151
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:22,582
with that Cosmic Power we can call it,

152
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:26,657
but it’s more than that, is Divine Power
I should say -

153
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:31,311
Divine power which is working
all the cosmos also.

154
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:44,046
So, if you just become silent within
yourself,

155
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:49,367
know that you are sitting in the Kingdom
of God.

156
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:58,801
It’s like this: when, say,

157
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:10,756
you get the great honour of becoming
a king,

158
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:18,113
then you walk up to your throne and you
sit down

159
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:25,864
and look around and you feel the silence

160
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:33,526
of this state that, now, you are the king.

161
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:42,159
This silence is the sign that you are
definitely, definitely,

162
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:51,833
you are now in contact with the Divine.

163
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:57,322
You are silent because the Divine is going
to look after everything.

164
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:03,205
You don’t have to do anything: just
keep silent.

165
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:07,809
But not forcibly. It’s, again, a state.

166
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:12,975
You see, if any turmoil takes place,
any problem takes place,

167
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:18,360
suddenly your attention will jump onto
that silence,

168
00:24:19,104 --> 00:24:22,763
and once you jump onto that silence

169
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:27,152
you [are] being in contact with this
whole All-pervading Power.

170
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:33,524
And when I talk about All-pervading Power
we still don’t understand what it is,

171
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:37,149
what it means, this All-pervading Power
of love.

172
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,148
Is it some sort of an energy floating
around?

173
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:52,085
Or is it some sort of a river? Or some sort
of a ether?

174
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:06,718
It is the complete, the totality
of Reality.

175
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:15,367
Complete totality of Reality, is this
All-pervading Power.

176
00:25:15,568 --> 00:25:19,352
Other things are unreal.

177
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:27,053
And the Reality is so efficient…

178
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:43,343
It is so efficient, It never fails,
like this mic.

179
00:25:50,165 --> 00:26:00,388
It’s such a tremendous, we can call –
the intertwined process;

180
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:10,119
which we cannot even imagine with this
human understanding,

181
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:15,833
how It controls, how It works.

182
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:23,338
I mean, for example [if] you see the trees.

183
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:29,472
The rose bush will give roses only,
it won’t give apples.

184
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:36,140
It will grow up to a certain height,
it won’t grow like a coconut tree.

185
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:48,495
All the characters of this nature is
maintained, nourished, looked after,

186
00:26:48,696 --> 00:26:57,415
controlled absolutely, at the right time,
at the right seasons -

187
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,520
that’s why in Sanskrit this is called
as ‘Rutambhara Pragya’.

188
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:08,680
‘Rutu’ means seasons, and the One which
looks after the seasons,

189
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:15,392
that knowledge which is enlightened:
simple definition.

190
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:19,941
But still it doesn’t explain,

191
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:28,104
because it is so complicated for a human
brain

192
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:32,445
that they cannot understand how it works.

193
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:36,446
Now all the miracles you have described
I’ve seen.

194
00:27:36,647 --> 00:27:41,144
I mean, there are so many still to be
recorded.

195
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:46,966
Is just a play of this Power

196
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:55,358
which thinks, understands, co-operates,
co-ordinates and loves

197
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:05,543
and looks after you. [It] is at your
disposal, at your disposal.

198
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:10,206
Wherever you go the connection is
maintained.

199
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:15,176
It’s like a governor travelling, you see,
the security travels with him.

200
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:18,605
So they are all around.

201
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:24,915
Not only with Me but with you also.

202
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:31,469
You are already booked there.

203
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:35,708
And They know you are the one they have
to look after,

204
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:39,006
They won’t look after anybody else,

205
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:42,747
They won’t do anything for anybody else
but for you people.

206
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:45,522
Now try to understand the self-esteem part.

207
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:49,553
You are Sahaja Yogis, means you are
such special people

208
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:56,239
that this Divine Power, wherever you may be,
whether you are sleeping, you are walking

209
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,956
or you are sitting under the tree or
in your house, wherever you are,

210
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:09,625
that connection is maintained. Like a
talkie-walkie you can call it, at the most.

211
00:29:09,826 --> 00:29:12,916
But you don’t have to talk, you don’t have
to say anything,

212
00:29:13,117 --> 00:29:17,492
you don’t have to command, you don’t have
to request,

213
00:29:17,693 --> 00:29:22,476
nothing - it is at your disposal.

214
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:30,609
Because already you are one
of the governors in the Realm of God.

215
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,193
So all the protocol, that is yours. Anybody
who tries to insult you or trouble you

216
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:42,582
has to pay for that kind of an action.
So you should never worry.

217
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:47,475
You should never think of those things
on the mundane level.

218
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:50,240
On the contrary I would say, better
forgive,

219
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:55,206
because God knows what will happen to that
person who misbehaves.

220
00:29:55,407 --> 00:30:02,954
It is not only compassion, also It is
wrathful,

221
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,355
It is wrathful.

222
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:15,784
You are special people; only thing [is]
you have to have your self-esteem

223
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:25,135
and you must try to maintain your balance.

224
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:32,599
Once you come in balance, the job of
a Guru is to give balance to others.

225
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,717
It balances everything. It will balance
the nature,

226
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:41,498
climate, atmosphere, society, human beings.

227
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:45,131
It is there to balance you.

228
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:54,528
And that balance comes from the Guru
Principle which balances you.

229
00:30:54,729 --> 00:31:01,030
If you have Guru Principle in you, you get
into balance – automatically!

230
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,788
Automatically you become a balanced
personality.

231
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:10,888
Nobody has to tell you, “Now you balance,”
you are balanced.

232
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:16,165
So now, how do we develop that balance?

233
00:31:20,863 --> 00:31:27,328
Of course in the ancient times they had
very severe methods –

234
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:32,466
is not to eat much, to starve yourself

235
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:37,167
and go to Himalayas, stand on your heads
and do all kinds of things.

236
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:42,325
This will bring great imbalance.

237
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:49,021
If you become an austere personality
it will make you such a dry person

238
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:55,416
that nobody would like to stand near you;
I mean, you’ll be burning, absolutely.

239
00:31:55,617 --> 00:32:01,185
So the ascetic ideas, I don’t know from
where it has come, whatever it has come.

240
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:08,332
Maybe because they wanted people to pay
more attention to their Spirit.

241
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:16,027
But a Guru is not ascetic by nature.

242
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,991
But he is so detached that he is ascetic.

243
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:25,775
He may be the king or he may be a beggar

244
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:29,906
or he may be a big personality somewhere

245
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:33,887
or he may be just an ordinary person.

246
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:44,771
If he is a Guru then in every state he is
in complete balance.

247
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,969
Nothing can disturb him.

248
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:56,831
Supposing you put a crown on his head –
so what?

249
00:32:57,032 --> 00:33:05,922
Whether it is a cardboard crown, silver
or gold or diamonds or anything,

250
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:14,501
it can never impress him and he can never
go into imbalances.

251
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:30,271
Food for example; food is one of the weak
points, I think.

252
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:39,551
A Guru who might eat quite a lot, he may
not eat at all;

253
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:48,139
may like something to eat, something not
to eat, whatever it is.

254
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:55,703
But nothing can dominate this Guru.

255
00:33:56,318 --> 00:34:03,315
So the symptom is that you are in balance

256
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:09,319
and you cannot be dominated by food
or by power

257
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,035
or by wealth or money or anything – nothing
can dominate you.

258
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:21,279
You are above all these things.

259
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:28,112
And once you know that you are above
these things,

260
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,838
then you are not afraid. No more you
are afraid.

261
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,617
Fearlessness comes into you, you become
absolutely fearless.

262
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:50,503
Nothing can, nothing can put you
into imbalance;

263
00:34:50,704 --> 00:34:57,379
nothing can dominate you; nothing can
weaken you;

264
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:06,071
nothing can make you an addict; nothing
is tempting.

265
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:13,841
There’s nothing like temptation left
anymore.

266
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,865
When you reach that state, beyond
temptation,

267
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:26,266
beyond any greed, beyond any lust,

268
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:38,906
then there is no problem;

269
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:44,873
nothing, nothing can really bring you down.

270
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:57,070
You may wear an ordinary tulsi [Indian
basil] garland, or you may wear

271
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:04,323
pearls, or diamonds, or anything.

272
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:13,130
That doesn’t touch you. But you don’t run
away from anything.

273
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:17,638
Because when you run away from something
you become an ascetic artificially.

274
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,477
Asceticism is within yourself – innate.

275
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:29,191
So nothing can hamper you, nothing can
matter.

276
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:40,269
That state we have to see. But mostly what
happens with people [is]

277
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,172
they’ll say, “Mother, I don’t think I’m
a Guru.” I said, “Why?”

278
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:48,091
“Because what symptom you told me,
all they are there.

279
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:52,342
I still want to eat this food, I still -
this thing.”

280
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,966
You are going the other way round.

281
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:01,416
You shouldn’t try to weigh upon what
I’m telling you

282
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:06,865
or try to judge yourself. Don’t judge.

283
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,259
You just gradually rise - appreciate
yourself.

284
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:22,865
And gradually you rise and settle down
on the position that you have achieved.

285
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:32,125
Instead of that you’ll feel very diffident
and you’ll feel very much depressed

286
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:36,335
if you start judging, “Oh, Mother has said
that we must have this,

287
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:39,830
Mother has said we must have this.”

288
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:49,598
If you all the time start judging yourself,
this will not help you.

289
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:57,054
You are self-assured! You are sure about
yourself.

290
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,766
There’s nothing to judge yourself
or to tally.

291
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:09,702
Sometimes I see some people go on saying,
“Mother said so.”

292
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:13,551
I might have said, might not have said,
out of reference,

293
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:20,958
whatever it is. What is it? Now, I have
said so. What are you saying?

294
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:27,079
Because this is a very good way
of troubling others:

295
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,041
“Mother said so.” “What did she say?”

296
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:38,512
“That you should not take your food
every day.” I never said it.

297
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:42,866
But somebody can start something like
that, stupid.

298
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:47,915
Supposing even if I’ve said it – doesn’t
matter – what do you have to say?

299
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:57,451
So you even out-grow, into your own
experience, what is good.

300
00:38:57,652 --> 00:39:02,709
You wouldn’t believe that I, as a human
being I’m useless.

301
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,302
Really, it was very difficult.

302
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:08,329
Actually my Father used to tell me so many
things about human beings.

303
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,792
What sort of a things they are and how
I should appear.

304
00:39:12,993 --> 00:39:17,472
And it’s very difficult to be a human
being, very, very difficult.

305
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,762
First I didn’t know why the reactions are
like this,

306
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:25,758
why people behave like this and what to do
with them, how to manage them.

307
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:33,442
It’s quite difficult. You can say even
William Blake had the same problem.

308
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:38,407
But when you reach that state,

309
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:47,084
then you’re just enjoying yourself.

310
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:53,860
For you, you have a greater enjoyment
than mine.

311
00:39:55,507 --> 00:40:04,321
Because you are already human beings,
so you know about human beings.

312
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:14,644
And then you see your ascent and it’s much
easier for you to appreciate [that].

313
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:20,201
For me it is… I don’t know, because I’ve
never known temptations,

314
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:23,737
I’ve never known all these qualities
that you had,

315
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:31,575
so I don’t know how to judge what is coming
out of it, you see.

316
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:37,375
If you don’t have any problems,

317
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:44,611
if you never had any, say, temptations.

318
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:50,259
As you were you are – what is so great?

319
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:57,682
But from something human you have come
to a higher level,

320
00:40:57,966 --> 00:41:04,362
is very creditable. And you can enjoy
much more than I could enjoy

321
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:10,806
or Christ could enjoy or Shri Krishna
could enjoy.

322
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:23,261
Because the one who has risen, has grown,

323
00:41:23,462 --> 00:41:30,041
now feels the fragrance of his virtues
and qualities and greatness;

324
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:33,252
then he enjoys himself.

325
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:42,066
“So what? I’m sitting here,” he’ll say,
“all right, I’m sitting here,

326
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:46,908
why are you bothered? I’m all right!”

327
00:41:50,906 --> 00:42:05,103
To him a proper understanding of this
change comes.

328
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:10,877
And he understands other human beings
much better

329
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:18,922
who don’t have your capacity, your
knowledge, your depth, your gravity.

330
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:23,697
Because you have been a human being.
Now you are Divine.

331
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:32,480
Because you have been a human being,
you understand other people.

332
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:40,767
So a Guru like me, I don’t know,

333
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:49,793
it’s a very different situation here
because I’m a Mother

334
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:58,300
and I have seen these Gurus, the real Gurus;
they are very harsh people, I must say.

335
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:02,875
I couldn’t understand how they beat people,
how they thrash them,

336
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:06,378
they hang them on the well, do all kinds
of things;

337
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,702
I couldn’t understand why do they do it.

338
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:16,826
But they have come out from the human
level, with struggles and fights,

339
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,570
so they think that, “Why should others
get it so easily?

340
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:23,351
Why not they also have the problem?”

341
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:26,598
But you didn’t get it on to all these
problems.

342
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:29,845
You are different from those gurus.

343
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:36,213
You got it sahaj. In a very simple manner,
you didn’t do anything.

344
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:43,046
Sahaj you got it, absolutely sahaj. You
didn’t do anything about it.

345
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,022
So your role as a guru is different from
those gurus

346
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:55,274
who struggled so much to become a evolved
soul.

347
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:00,072
So your attitude towards things

348
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:07,480
has to be more compassionate, more
understanding,

349
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:13,419
more loving. As you got it sahaj,
others can also get it from you.

350
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:18,795
You don’t have to do something horrible,
you don’t have to shout at them.

351
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:22,858
Some people who met me told me,
and which is very sad,

352
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,868
that some sahaja yogis said something
harsh to them

353
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:28,871
so they had to leave Sahaja Yoga.

354
00:44:29,072 --> 00:44:35,404
A sahaja yogi should never say anything
harsh to anyone; he has no right to say.

355
00:44:36,726 --> 00:44:40,037
Because without saying anything to you,
you got your realisation,

356
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:45,609
absolutely free. Without doing anything
you have got your realisation

357
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,729
and if somebody is coming to you
for realisation

358
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,555
you must do in the same manner.

359
00:44:52,756 --> 00:45:04,300
You didn’t get it through some sort of
a austere, austere - we can say - training.

360
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:07,506
So this attitude must be changed.

361
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:11,439
And I’ve seen that if you have this
attitude

362
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,526
then you could be a guru, but not sahaj.

363
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:23,176
So now try to understand that there is
a difference between a sahaja guru

364
00:45:23,377 --> 00:45:31,305
and a non-sahaj guru. They are very
hot-tempered, very.

365
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:37,565
And a sahaj guru has no business to be
hot-tempered.

366
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:47,184
Everything so nice, so beautiful we have,

367
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:54,064
all enjoying this beautiful atmosphere.

368
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:59,340
Such love, such compassion, such respect
for each other.

369
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:03,553
No competition, no politics.

370
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:11,711
Just if you understand one thing that you
have got everything in sahaj manner,

371
00:46:11,912 --> 00:46:15,841
and in the same sahaj manner you can
give it to others

372
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:23,095
and you’ll respect others [in] the same
manner, I think you’ll be able to…

373
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:25,788
[There’s a gentleman who’s taking
photographs, see who he is,

374
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:29,468
he is not supposed to take photographs
of all these things.

375
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:39,146
Without permission he should not take.

376
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:50,094
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

377
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:58,285
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

378
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,482
These are mischievous people, you know].

379
00:47:16,307 --> 00:47:20,346
So now we are in a sahaj style.

380
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:26,672
You all know that you’ve got all
the powers, that you are all gurus,

381
00:47:26,873 --> 00:47:31,987
that you have achieved so much, you can
do so much.

382
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:36,410
Then you have to be sahaj.
You got it sahaj,

383
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:44,242
so you have no business to be harsh,
horrible, hot-tempered or strict gurus.

384
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:47,317
But it crawls up. I’ve seen sometimes

385
00:47:47,518 --> 00:47:51,328
quite a lot of military business starts
in Sahaja Yoga also:

386
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:57,163
military sort of treatment. That cannot be.

387
00:47:57,618 --> 00:48:03,455
No disciplining is needed. They’ll be
disciplined by themselves.

388
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:07,310
They are gurus, who can discipline a guru?

389
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:14,984
And then they are sahaj. So your style
is very different.

390
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:20,782
None of these gurus knew how to even
give realisation.

391
00:48:20,983 --> 00:48:23,987
I’m telling you frankly.

392
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,630
They never knew that Kundalini can rise
with their hands.

393
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:36,910
Very few people historically have given
realisation – so far.

394
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:41,176
But you people are giving left and right
to anybody who comes, sit down.

395
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:44,189
Just now I said, “All right, come along,
look at this person”.

396
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,230
So all of you sit down, “Now, this is it,
this is it.”

397
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:53,036
You have crossed the limits of science now.
You have become science yourself

398
00:48:53,237 --> 00:48:55,831
of the Divine and you know each and
everything about it,

399
00:48:56,032 --> 00:49:00,507
“This chakra is catching, that is catching,
I’m catching, you are catching.”

400
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:05,442
But the way we deal with others is
the guru pada:

401
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:11,157
kindness, sweetness, concern.

402
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:18,160
That’s what your Mother has given you -
concern.

403
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:31,875
The concern that flows; about each
and every person.

404
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:35,757
You have to have concern.

405
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:44,547
But these gurus: “Now you go!” They’ll
[say]: “Die, kill yourself! Eat grass.”

406
00:49:47,213 --> 00:49:49,807
No, not that way.

407
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:57,315
So you also have to be a motherly guru,

408
00:49:59,628 --> 00:50:06,865
a sweet guru, extremely sweet, kindly

409
00:50:09,922 --> 00:50:14,762
and understanding, forgiving.

410
00:50:16,424 --> 00:50:23,995
Because what is the purpose? What is
the purpose?

411
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:27,408
The purpose is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

412
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:30,849
That’s the main thing we miss out:
that the purpose

413
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,554
of our realisation or of our birth

414
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:38,054
is to give realisations to others,
to spread Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:42,023
to emancipate others, by that to emancipate
the whole world.

416
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:49,241
It’s our responsibility. If you are
responsible then how do you behave?

417
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:56,633
So no more we have priesthood, no more.

418
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,324
Nor that one person says so,

419
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:03,411
that person says so, this has happened -
nothing of the kind.

420
00:51:03,612 --> 00:51:08,224
What you have to say, you say it
to that person.

421
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:12,488
And you yourself will see how you are
reflecting

422
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:16,348
your personality on another person,

423
00:51:16,896 --> 00:51:23,033
how he reacts and he, how he behaves.

424
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:28,325
Gradually I’ve seen our collectivity
is learning all this.

425
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:32,509
Gradually I find all those horrible
dominating people

426
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,309
have run away from Sahaja Yoga.

427
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:42,557
Also I find that people are extremely
loving

428
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:48,802
and kindly to each other and also
to others.

429
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:55,562
Because you are embodiment of goodness,
embodiment of righteousness,

430
00:51:55,763 --> 00:52:02,452
you are embodiment of patience,
compassion, love and concern.

431
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:13,240
So it is not how you can do it, you are
already.

432
00:52:14,074 --> 00:52:21,262
But you shouldn’t just give up. I said,
“Just look at something and watch.”

433
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:25,237
Nobody can do that, but you all can do it.

434
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:33,776
So the self-esteem, and then assumption.
Assume your powers.

435
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:40,904
If you are a guru, then assume your power.

436
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:47,793
You do not assume your power.
You still think,

437
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:52,911
“God knows if I have the powers or not”,
this, that.

438
00:52:53,112 --> 00:53:00,137
That means you are just a beginner still.
“No, I’m the guru, all right.”

439
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:06,613
We do say, “Mother, I’m my own guru,”
that’s all.

440
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,361
But is just saying from the lips.

441
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:14,660
Not only that you are your own guru
but of the whole world.

442
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:23,130
It’s a collective ‘gurudom’ we have,
I should say collective.

443
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:29,666
And nothing can escape us now, we are
formidable, absolutely formidable.

444
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:32,871
Nothing can escape us.

445
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:45,473
If this is understood that we have
to assume.

446
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:50,818
Here now, they elect somebody who is
a very cruel man,

447
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:57,850
put some clothes on him and say he is
the pope. All right, he’s the pope.

448
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:00,776
But he is not!

449
00:54:01,649 --> 00:54:06,246
He is just acting, but inside he is not.

450
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:12,246
That he is infallible - he is fallible!
100 times.

451
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:19,998
That is not with us. We have all these
things within ourselves.

452
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:27,141
We’ve got them, they are there, we are the
possessors of that, only thing you assume.

453
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:30,908
Once you start assuming, all badhas will
run away, everything will run away

454
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:35,730
and you’ll be surprised. Who can stand
a person

455
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:39,112
who is a saint, who is a guru and who
knows he is a guru?

456
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:43,090
Nobody can stand. They’ll run away.

457
00:54:45,888 --> 00:54:51,425
But you have to have introspection

458
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:59,573
to see that your self-esteem is completely
correct.

459
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:03,430
It’s not just [that] you are thinking
you are a guru.

460
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:10,973
I have known some real gurus and I would
never allow you to go to them

461
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:16,887
because God knows if you can come back
in one piece or not.

462
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:23,963
And I’ve told them, that they are real
gurus, I know, but don’t go near them.

463
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:30,836
Because what they lack is this compassion,
this sahaj style.

464
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,264
Because they think they have worked
very hard,

465
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:37,479
so why should these people not work
very hard.

466
00:55:40,277 --> 00:55:46,925
You may be anything. You can be doing
this work, that work.

467
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:51,262
You may be educated, not educated,
makes no difference.

468
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:56,405
Whether you are rich, poor, makes
no difference at all,

469
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:05,549
as long as you know that you are the guru
and you assume your power.

470
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:13,551
In that assumption as if any talent, if you
know music, you know you know music.

471
00:56:14,192 --> 00:56:17,777
If you know how to cook, you know
how to cook.

472
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:20,876
If you are an administrator and if you know
administration,

473
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:27,770
you know administration. But that could be
also not totally absolute.

474
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:34,664
But you are already Absolute Totality
of Reality.

475
00:56:34,865 --> 00:56:40,193
The Reality is at your disposal. But you
assume it!

476
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:43,733
You are not ordinary at all.

477
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:48,402
We can say you are extraordinary
in ordinary.

478
00:56:51,936 --> 00:57:00,021
In that you will just drop out all that
is nonsensical, you’ll just drop out.

479
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:09,241
Others will see you and will be surprised:
what sort of people these are.

480
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:16,862
What sort of a life they lead, how nice
they are, how kind they are.

481
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:20,129
And the knowledge is so subtle and so
great

482
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:28,294
and of such a highest degree. But you never
feel bloated up with ego.

483
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:31,970
I have not seen any sahaja yogi who says,
“Oh, I know all about chakras,

484
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:38,360
this and that. How dare you say like that!”
With the moustaches upward.

485
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:45,765
No! With all this knowledge you bend down

486
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:50,542
like the tree which is laden with fruits
bends down.

487
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:56,722
And that humility, that simplicity and that
humility

488
00:57:56,923 --> 00:58:08,101
gives you the special edge which can
pierce into any heart.

489
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:15,669
Thus you became apostles of Truth.

490
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:22,020
You can become prophets like William Blake.
You can.

491
00:58:23,495 --> 00:58:29,892
So many things you’ll be manifesting
and you won’t believe yourself.

492
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,958
But believe,

493
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:48,536
you are one with that Great Power which
is God Almighty.

494
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:57,452
They were discussing for ages I think,
about the immaculate conception of Christ.

495
00:58:57,653 --> 00:59:05,908
Such stupid people I’ve never seen.
But He is God!

496
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:13,527
He is God Almighty, He is not a human
being! He can do anything!

497
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:27,577
How can you judge Him? And judge
His powers and His working, how can you?

498
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:32,768
To discuss about God, have you got
His brains?

499
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:39,599
I mean, it’s something, a person like me
discussing about banking.

500
00:59:43,308 --> 00:59:49,755
Say, I - after say one or two sentences
I go off.

501
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:55,454
In the same way, when you start
discussing God,

502
00:59:55,655 --> 01:00:04,318
you must know you do not have that capacity
to discuss about God,

503
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:09,822
what His relations are, how He got a son,
this and that.

504
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:19,618
Who are you? What’s your own position
that you can discuss?

505
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:27,565
And then in that humility you realise:
He’s God Almighty.

506
01:00:28,683 --> 01:00:38,004
He’s Almighty. He can do anything!

507
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,672
Then that faith, not blind,

508
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:52,202
but a real faith in that feeling that God
is Almighty

509
01:00:52,638 --> 01:00:57,007
and that now you have become the messenger
of that God Almighty,

510
01:00:57,208 --> 01:01:04,715
gives you all the strength, all
the courage, everything.

511
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:12,893
And His compassion, His love, His attention
and His understanding.

512
01:01:13,094 --> 01:01:21,170
So this faith should be absolutely one
with you.

513
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:27,170
Once I went to meet one real guru.
Oh, he was a very horrid fellow otherwise!

514
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:31,766
He has slapped so many people, thrown
so many people down from the hills

515
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:34,598
and all that kinds of things he has done,
no doubt.

516
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:40,759
But still for me he has tremendous regards.
I went to him,

517
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:46,312
so he just started talking to me as if he
would talk to a Goddess.

518
01:01:46,513 --> 01:01:49,094
He said, “How do you find these worldly
people here?”

519
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:53,370
I said, “All right, after all I have
created them.”

520
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:02,598
“Ah but,” he said, “Still but, you are God,

521
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:07,352
with your power why don’t you change
them a little bit?”

522
01:02:08,114 --> 01:02:11,990
I said, “That’s what is the problem. I have
given them freedom.

523
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:17,019
I’ve said, ‘All right, it’s freedom to you.

524
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:23,854
You can choose if you want to get
transformed or not,’ I cannot force.”

525
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:29,003
He said, “But God Almighty you are,
you can do anything.”

526
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:34,811
I said, “I can do everything, but I do not
want to do certain things;

527
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:41,635
and one of them is to take away the freedom
from them.

528
01:02:41,836 --> 01:02:44,697
That is their freedom to choose.

529
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:48,239
That’s given to them because, if they have
to have the ultimate freedom,

530
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,320
they should have their, this little freedom
intact.”

531
01:02:54,449 --> 01:03:00,304
So he was quarrelling with me about this.
He said, “But when you are God Almighty

532
01:03:00,505 --> 01:03:06,845
there could be some other method!
These horrible people, what to do?”

533
01:03:07,908 --> 01:03:15,858
I said, “Your concern is all right and I
understand because you are a guru,

534
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:23,328
but when I’m God Almighty supposing,
then my style is different.

535
01:03:23,529 --> 01:03:32,013
I can’t be like you.” Then he said,
“That’s true. You can’t be like me.”

536
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:36,510
That is what I found in him.

537
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:43,645
He was talking to me only as if I’m God
standing before him.

538
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:51,950
And then see, he told all the disciples,
“You see, you praise, you praise the Lord,

539
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:59,948
you praise Her, ‘suti kara’, because God
is fond of praise.”

540
01:04:00,774 --> 01:04:04,494
I said, “Really?” “Yes!

541
01:04:04,994 --> 01:04:08,423
If you praise the Lord then He gives you
everything, I’ve seen that.

542
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:12,887
I always praise Him. Whenever I want
something to be done

543
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:16,417
I just praise Him and He does it for me.”

544
01:04:18,203 --> 01:04:26,117
So, I said, “It’s true, I must accept.”
Because He’s bhakti gamya.

545
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:32,292
You cannot get to Mother unless and until
you have really bhakti from your heart.

546
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:40,656
Is all already sort of a built-in
restriction. What can I do?

547
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:45,932
If you don’t have bhakti you cannot get
to Mother, no, you cannot.

548
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,825
You cannot get to God.

549
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:58,208
But if you have bhakti, then you can get
to Mother. Is written “bhakti gamya”.

550
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:02,432
If somebody says, “All right. Raise
my Kundalini!”

551
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:04,923
I cannot raise his Kundalini, not
[only that]

552
01:05:05,124 --> 01:05:09,194
but for seven lives he won’t have
realisation!

553
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:15,822
But if somebody says, “Mother, will you
please give me realisation?” Once!

554
01:05:16,242 --> 01:05:23,011
So not only humility but bhakti. And bhakti
is only possible if you have your faith.

555
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:26,910
That’s the thing is the faith, which is
challenged nowadays

556
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:31,245
by all kinds of stupid people;
intellectuals, these horrible people

557
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:35,001
who are taking out yarns out of their head,
or also by science

558
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:40,816
and this so-called ‘Catholic Church’ and
this Church and that Church.

559
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:54,482
So your faith in God has to be absolutely,
absolutely untarnishable.

560
01:05:54,683 --> 01:06:00,997
Nothing can disturb that. That’s very
important.

561
01:06:01,316 --> 01:06:03,613
You have seen all the miracles of God,

562
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:10,503
you have seen how you’re working out
His powers,

563
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:18,682
you have known all these things. But still
the faith in God is missing.

564
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:23,383
The person who has complete faith in God
is called as the one…

565
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:31,012
is God himself they say. Is called
as Paramachaitanya.

566
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:42,198
The guru is called as the one who is
himself Brahmachaitanya.

567
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:53,455
So when this faith in God is absolutely
established in you

568
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:59,518
that, “There is God Almighty, He’s
Almighty,

569
01:06:59,726 --> 01:07:05,334
and that I am the messenger of that God.”

570
01:07:05,762 --> 01:07:11,591
Just this understanding, when it becomes
absolutely firm in you,

571
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:15,496
then you are in the Gurupada.

572
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,911
I bless you today that all of you achieve
that state

573
01:07:20,112 --> 01:07:24,901
that you reside in that Gurupada state.

574
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:33,173
And wherever you are, whatever may be
your position, whatever you may do,

575
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:43,372
the faith in the God Almighty that is
so truly within you will express itself.

576
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:51,501
Not only [that] but that it will manifest,
it will act; just like God.

577
01:07:55,929 --> 01:08:01,037
So many things can be said. I’ve said
so many things before.

578
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:05,363
And so many can be said later on also;

579
01:08:05,564 --> 01:08:12,437
but today we have to remember one thing,
that we must have complete faith

580
01:08:12,638 --> 01:08:17,260
in the Kingdom of God and in the powers
of God Almighty,

581
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:23,910
complete faith, and then in ourselves.

582
01:08:24,676 --> 01:08:27,520
May God bless you all.
