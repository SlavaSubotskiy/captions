1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,160
Barbara: Thank you, Mother.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,580
Barbara: Before we begin, I would like to
introduce myself to those of 

4
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,750
you in the room. My name is Barbara Schuler
and I do a radio program on a station from

5
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,660
Monterey called Discovery which is usually
on Wednesdays from 1 to 2:30. And, is going

6
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,990
to be now on Thursdays from 11 to - 11:30
to 1 o’clock. And, it’s my privilege to

7
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,860
be here to do a taped interview for my listeners.

8
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,860
So, for the listeners I would like to say
that we are at the Kennolyn Campgrounds in

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,610
Santa Cruz and this is an interview with Her
Holiness Mataji.

10
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:01,290
Mother, today there are many, many things
said about Sahaja Yoga, about Your philosophy,

11
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,100
and very little is said about who You are
as a person. [Shri Mataji laughs] And, I thought

12
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,640
it would be good to start out with some, some
questions about who You are; who were You

13
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,640
as a child; what people influenced You; what
brought You to the place You are today as

14
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,530
a Luminous Being sitting before me and before
us.

15
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,260
Shri Mataji: I am a very ancient being – that
problem is like this. [laughter] I had to…

16
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,260
what can I tell you about Myself? I just don’t
know what part will interest you, but only

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:44,240
thing I can say that I was born with this
understanding and awareness that I have to

18
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,830
find out a method by which I could give en
masse Realization to people. I was a Realized

19
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,420
Soul, of course. I knew all about it from
My very childhood. But the problem was that

20
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,420
how to make many people get it, because if
one person gets it or one person has it; if

21
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,990
one person is an incarnation, people don’t
understand it. Not only that but they may

22
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,210
even try to destroy such a person. That’s
what happened to all the saints who came on

23
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,660
this earth. Christ was crucified; Mohammed
Sahib was given poison - because they were

24
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,250
ignorant. They did not know what it was, what
was He saying.

25
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:41,250
So, it was important first of all to find
out a method how to give them en masse Realization,

26
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,850
and from that angle I just thought that “this
is why I am on this earth and I have to do

27
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,850
this job” for which I wanted to study about
human beings. I took My birth in a Christian

28
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,959
family and that too a family which was Protestant
family, because I felt that Protestants are

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,040
fanatics but very sophisticated. [laughter]
And, they rationalize everything to such an

30
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,840
extent that nobody can see beyond it. So,
I better take My birth in them and My father

31
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,030
and mother had already taken birth whom I
had chosen as My parents. They were great

32
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:39,030
people, realized souls and specially My father
was a person who knew why I was on this earth.

33
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,180
Even My mother knew about it.

34
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,180
So, a special rapport was between them and
Me and they could understand why I was busy

35
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,440
meditating or finding out about how to give
realization to others. Then, I would say My

36
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,740
father was a very learned man, who knew about
fourteen languages, who translated Quran-e-Sharif

37
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,490
into Hindi, who was a member of the Constituent
Assembly. He made our Constitution. Also,

38
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,490
he was the only Christian to be elected in
those days. And, then My mother was a honors

39
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,050
in Mathematics. All very well-educated and
nice people!

40
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,480
They dedicated their life to the cause of
freedom of India. And, I also felt that that

41
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,800
was very important, because if we are not
free we cannot do anything on religious basis.

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,800
There’s one thing is to be free from this
level. And, that’s how I also helped them

43
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,280
a lot and our whole family suffered a lot.
And, I went through terrible times, terrible

44
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,600
times since very young age.

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,350
I was with Mahatma Gandhi also because he
liked Me very much as a child. So, I stayed

46
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,100
on with him then I used to come back to study
again, go back to him. He used to call Me

47
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,250
“Nepali” because My face is a Nepali face.
And, he used to talk to Me as if he is talking

48
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,320
to his grandmother sometimes. [laughter] It
was very sweet and he was a very sweet man

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,770
– extremely sweet person to children. Very
strict with himself and strict with others

50
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,770
- elderly people - but with children he was
very, very sweet and kind and would try to

51
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,639
learn from children lot of things. It was
surprising how he understood that there’s

52
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,639
lot of wisdom with the children sometimes
than with the older people who are mixed up.

53
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Now, we got our independence and we had a
very bad setback because of the partition

54
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,729
we had in our country. And, I was studying
in Lahore Medical College there because I

55
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:05,620
wanted to know about medicine – what these
people call such and such thing. Because I

56
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,870
knew all this but … I knew about the body,
I knew about everything, what you call the

57
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,410
complete nervous system, but I did not know
what was the vocabulary attached to it, so

58
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,610
I studied there for two years. Now after that,
this war broke out. So, I had to discontinue

59
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:29,310
with My studies and My parents wanted Me to
get married. And, then I found that My marriage

60
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,310
was important, I agreed to marry and I married
this gentleman, Mr. C.P. Srivastava.

61
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:41,310
Then during all that time, My only pastime
or the full-time work was to find out about

62
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:51,850
human beings – what’s the problem they
have. How they avoid reality? How they shun

63
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,660
it? How they run away from it? What are their
problems? How are they seeking? What do they

64
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:05,660
have to offer? What will they accept? How
to handle them? It was quite a intricate question.

65
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Every person provided a new sample of problems
and I had to fight it out. In a way that it

66
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:20,259
was a system which I knew how to do it, because
to enter into somebody subtly, to understand

67
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,090
the problems of the Kundalini – you can
go into the journey and find out about a person.

68
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,709
And, then I found out the permutations and
combinations of their problems. So, like it

69
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:38,789
is like, you can say that like periodic tables.
You had to divide them into three, then into

70
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,209
seven, then into their permutations and combinations.
So, you can imagine – three into seven,

71
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:48,679
raised to power eternity – it was like that.
But doesn’t matter! It worked out and in

72
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:55,679
the year 1970 on the fifth of May. I was little
bit hesitant at that time. I thought I should

73
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:09,800
wait but certain circumstances made Me to
open the last center.

74
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,800
And, when I opened the last center, it started
working with others on en masse scale. But

75
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:24,309
still I gave Realization only to one lady
who came to My house. I tried if it works

76
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:31,309
out with her and she … I gave her Realization
by touching her centers one by one - six centers

77
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:36,550
and then bringing out the Kundalini on top
of the head.

78
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,519
Barbara: What does it mean to open the last
center?

79
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,980
Shri Mataji: The Sahasrara. Last center is
the center which is the limbic area where

80
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,619
is the seat of all the seven centers. It’s
all integration there. So far, everybody who

81
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:56,749
has come – like, Christ has come on this
center what you call the Agnya Chakra. Or,

82
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:01,279
Krishna has come on this center which is the
Vishuddhi Chakra. Like that, they have been

83
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,110
appearing on every center of ours – giving
us a new dimension to our awareness. And,

84
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,179
that’s how our awareness has improved to
this extent and now the time is for you to

85
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:21,179
get your Absolute; to get your Spirit – that
your Spirit must shine into your attention,

86
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:30,679
that you should have your Self-Realization,
that you should have your second birth. That’s

87
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:39,189
the time! And, that is only possible if baptism,
the real baptism works out - real. Not artificial

88
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:44,360
- somebody coming and putting the hand on
your head and saying, “Now, you are baptized.”

89
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,540
That’s not the way. But it is a real thing
that happens that you start feeling the Cool

90
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,009
Breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out.

91
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:59,009
So, then I started giving first of all Realization
without confronting any kind of a position

92
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:06,369
or anything. I started with one lady. Then
I went ahead with it. Then the first twelve

93
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:12,569
people got Realization. Then I was very happy
because en masse Realization has started.

94
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:19,089
Then gradually it started working out. I went
to Indian villages. I thought they are better

95
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:23,889
simple people. First work on the simpler people
and they got Realization. Now, we have thousands

96
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,910
of people in the villages who have got Realization.
They have dropped out all their bad habits.

97
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:35,470
They have become very creative. They are doing
very well. They are very happy. And, they

98
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,249
are experts. So many of them are experts,
I can say, in India now whom we call as Sahaja

99
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:46,259
Yogi, maybe in thousands. Some are working
in the villages; some are working in some

100
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,739
cities. So, we have lots of people now in
India who can do this job.

101
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,709
Barbara: This all happened since 1970?

102
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,949
Shri Mataji: I started it.

103
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:55,369
Barbara: You started?

104
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:55,779
Shri Mataji: Yeah.

105
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:02,779
Barbara: I have a question that’s important
to me and to many people who are searching

106
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:09,269
for something or seeking perhaps, what you
call, Self Realization or Sahaja Yoga or something.

107
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:16,269
Some of us don’t know exactly what it is.
But we find that there are many teachers.

108
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:22,170
How do we recognize those teachers that you
might call fraudulent from the real ones?

109
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,910
It’s so difficult because they all seem
to be able to inspire us in certain ways and

110
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,790
give us experiences. How do we know who is
teaching something that’s true or who is

111
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,059
being deceptive?

112
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:41,199
Shri Mataji: First and foremost thing is,
anybody who lives on your earnings is not

113
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:48,199
a guru. A guru will never live on the earnings
of his disciples. But here there are people

114
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,209
who have built palaces, bought aircrafts and
cars and this. I mean, this is something one

115
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:02,209
should understand. It’s so, so open to you
to understand. I mean, I cannot understand

116
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:08,819
more obvious thing that this one is that it’s
a parasitic living. And, you cannot have a

117
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:14,249
parasites as your gurus. They can be parasites
but not your gurus. That’s one of the things.

118
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:14,879
And if you… [laughter]

119
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,879
I mean, you can retain some people, you know.
If you want because you are rich people, you

120
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,239
can retain some. That’s a different point
but you cannot have them as gurus. Guru has

121
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:33,239
to be a higher personality, you see. Now,
you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

122
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,279
He didn’t take any money from anyone. He
was a carpenter’s son and He used to do

123
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,239
carpentry Himself and He lived like a modest
man. He never lived with big cars and big

124
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:49,069
houses. It’s not necessary because such
a person is Himself is a very big king, you

125
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:54,399
see, like a big emperor. He doesn’t need
anything. An emperor doesn’t need anything

126
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,040
because nothing can give him comfort except
that he himself is in complete comfort. So,

127
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,790
such a person doesn’t want anything. So,
you must see that such a person has no needs

128
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,949
of comfort at all. He can sleep on the grounds,
he can sleep anywhere.

129
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:17,949
Now, in this life, I should say I come from
a quite a wealthy family or married to another

130
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:25,069
wealthy man, you can say that way according
to your own relative ideas. But to Me, I can

131
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:31,779
sleep anywhere. I have no problem. I have
no problem of food, no problem of sleeping

132
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:38,069
anywhere, no comfort. And, I find it is beyond
My self-respect to live on the earnings of

133
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:42,769
others. It’s not proper. But you are My
children. Supposing now you bring a flower

134
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,629
to Me or something, it’s all right but I
can’t have a palace out of your money and

135
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,660
all those things. It’s absurd. Absolutely
absurd! So, this is one thing one should know

136
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,559
that it pampers our ego that we can purchase
our guru. We can purchase our Self-Realization.

137
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,559
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.
And, that’s how people accept, you see.

138
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:09,149
They don’t want to accept a person who says,
“You cannot offer anything.” It’s too

139
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:10,359
much for them.

140
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:17,359
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people
think that if you pay something then you get

141
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,709
attached to it, you go through it whatever
it is. Say, you have paid for a ticket and

142
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,220
you find that the whole play is horrid, you
can’t bear it but you have to go through

143
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,669
it because you have paid for it. That’s
the human nature, you see.

144
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:30,160
Barbara: Yeah

145
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,999
Shri Mataji: That’s the human nature. I
have seen that. They do it. And that’s what

146
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,910
it works out. But this is very gross level,
I’m telling you. But another should be that

147
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,499
in these modern times, it is promised that
you will become prophets. You have to become

148
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:52,230
prophets. So, you must see have you become
prophets out of these? Easiest is to see the

149
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,790
disciples of this man.

150
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,279
Any XYZ who says he is a guru – now what
is happening to the disciple? Is he a free

151
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,290
person? Has he got any knowledge? Has he got
any mastery? What has he achieved by being

152
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,929
with that person?

153
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:09,889
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.
One better than the other! You talk to them,

154
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:16,449
they are knowledge. Some of them have met
Me only for a say, eight day or so. They have

155
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:21,119
become knowledge. So, what have they achieved
you should see. What is their style of life,

156
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:26,389
their pattern of life, how they behave? And,
there cannot be any privacy about it, you

157
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,869
see, like mafia – you don’t tell that
and you don’t say that and you shouldn’t

158
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:37,869
do that. Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, the truth
is exposed gradually, but it is not like this

159
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:43,040
that if you give some money, nobody knows.
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga,

160
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,230
you see. Now, supposing we have to build an
ashram, say for example. All right, you build

161
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,619
your ashram; you collect your money, do what
you like and know about it. I have nothing

162
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:56,350
to do with it. Also, among yourself you should
know how you got the money, how you spent

163
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:03,350
it, what is the expense and all that. Because
ashram you can pay for but not for your Realization.

164
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,420
This is one thing is very important that what
you get out of it is important that you should

165
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,350
become a prophet.

166
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,810
Have you become a prophet?

167
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,620
Then, thirdly, you must know that if you are
going from one to another, what we call guru

168
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,380
shopping business – that means you have
not found it. Otherwise, you would just settle

169
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,230
down. But some people are so weak that they
do settle down with one and are finished with

170
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,400
them. You must always see the people who go
to these gurus, what have they got. Have they

171
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,370
got their transformation? Because this is
the age of transformation.

172
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:48,370
Barbara: Mataji, what about teachers or gurus
who produce miracles. You go to a guru who

173
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:52,770
will materialize something out of the air
and say, “This is divine.” That’s a….

174
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,020
Shri Mataji: This is all jugglery. It’s
all jugglery. And also, you see, now supposing

175
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,850
somebody says, “I produce a diamond.”
Now, these people come from India, why don’t

176
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:08,220
they solve the financial problem of India?
[laughter and applause]

177
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,320
Secondly, you see, at every point they can
be challenged. You should say that … then

178
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,440
all right, one gentleman came to Me and said
that, “He gave me a diamond.”

179
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,810
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you
have?”

180
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,060
He said, “Hundreds.”

181
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,910
Then I said, “Why did he give you? He should
give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond.”

182
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:31,780
You see, that is what it is. So, it is all
jugglery. You should see those who materialize,

183
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,190
what have they given you? They have to give
you something eternal. If they talk about

184
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,520
God, God is not going to give you diamond.
Which God has given diamonds to people? Have

185
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,520
you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No! [laughter]
So, you should ask for something which is

186
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,420
the highest, which is the supreme most.

187
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Now, the fourth thing which is very important
that whatever experiences you get, for example,

188
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,030
some people start just like jumping, some
start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

189
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,860
And, they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming
out. We are taking out, you see.”

190
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,890
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,
they get into troubles and they get into pains

191
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,850
and all sorts of things and contortions. They
say, “Now your subconscious is coming out.”

192
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,090
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one
thing you must know. The subconscious, as

193
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,290
I told you, is on the left hand side and the
supraconscious on the right hand side. What

194
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:36,290
you have to do is to ascend in the center
and come up. Above your head is the superconsciousness

195
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,550
and when you become that, then you develop
collective consciousness. So, those who want

196
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:48,830
you to become like frogs again, you must know
that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

197
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:55,830
That’s not anyway evolution. The evolution
has to go higher, not becoming frogs or earthworms,

198
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:04,190
you see. And if you start crawling, it is
simple mesmerism. Anybody mesmerizes can do

199
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,080
these tricks, you see. It’s simple mesmerism.
And, then to believe that now you are surrendered

200
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:16,080
and all that is all nonsense, you see. It
has no meaning to Realization. In Realization,

201
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,100
you just become the master. You become the
master of it.

202
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:27,070
There are many people in this country who
came and lured you by their talks also. Talking

203
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,260
big about Brahma, Atmatatva, this that and
everything – that is not the way you can...

204
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,970
That is what is just the pendulum moving from
Christian sermon to Hindu sermon and from

205
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,660
Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon, from there
to the Rabbi sermon. It goes on like that,

206
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,830
you see. That’s not the way. You have to
rise higher within yourself. And, that’s

207
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:55,040
why those who lecture about these things are
really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

208
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,660
And, so many have died of cancer, this, that.
I don’t know what to say that people who

209
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,410
go to these people get into very bad troubles
and suffer so much. And, then on top of that

210
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:10,710
when all this happens, they say that, “You
must suffer.” That’s a very good excuse.

211
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,990
[laughter] “You must suffer.” You must
pay to suffer. Pay money to suffer. [laughter]

212
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,680
And, then people go on suffering.

213
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,660
Now, one thing I have to tell you that Christ
has suffered for us. We don’t have to suffer

214
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,920
anymore. Those who deny His sufferings will
have to go for suffering. All right, have

215
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,510
it! But He suffered for us. There is no need
for us to suffer anymore. When He is awakened

216
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:41,800
within us, He takes away all that is our ego
means our karmas, our superego, that is our

217
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,980
conditioning completely removed and you become
one with the Divine. There is no need for

218
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,020
anybody to suffer and this idea of suffering
is all nonsensical. You should not suffer

219
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,500
at all.

220
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Barbara: Good! [laughter] I’m glad it’s
over. Mataji, You are called “Mother.”

221
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,290
And, it seems in the Hindu tradition there’s
a special context or meaning of the word “Mother.”

222
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,080
What is this meaning?

223
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Shri Mataji: You see, in the Indian philosophy,
even in the Christian philosophy it is so,

224
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:27,570
but it has been little bit changed. If you
read the books of Essene, you will find they

225
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,460
have described the “Mother.” You see,
the Holy Ghost is the Mother. When they say

226
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,880
about the Holy Ghost, She is the Mother. But
how can you have… You must reason it out.

227
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,760
How can you have a father and a son without
a mother? [laughter] It’s a, you see, simple

228
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,970
thing like that. You see, so it’s the Mother
only. Holy Ghost is very important. So, Holy

229
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,190
Ghost is the Mother, you see. It’s absurd
thing, I mean, to have such a thing. Even

230
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,770
homosexuals cannot have children. It’s funny
thing, isn’t it. Absolutely absurd! But

231
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:58,690
Christians accepted this. I don’t know why.
Why didn’t they go into find out what is

232
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,840
this Holy Ghost business is? They said, “It’s
a mystery.” How can you say it’s a mystery?

233
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,270
When you cannot explain then better not say
anything about it. So, Holy Ghost is something

234
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,510
hanging in the air. No one knows; it’s a
mystery, and the rest of it is the father

235
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,400
and the son. It’s absurd!

236
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:20,300
Now, the principle of Mother is in every,
every scripture - has to be there. Now, the

237
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,300
Mother’s character is that She is the One
Who is the Womb, She is the One Who is the

238
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,810
Mother Earth and She is the One Who nourishes
you. She nourishes us, you know that. And,

239
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:41,070
this feminine thing in every human being resides
as this Kundalini, as you have seen. And,

240
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:48,010
when She rises, She gives you this new awareness
which becomes compassion, which is flowing,

241
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:55,010
which becomes soothing, nourishing energy
of love. And, that’s what today people are

242
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,440
saying feminist this thing and all that. That’s
again a pendulum – a man becoming a woman,

243
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,970
woman becoming man – all this problem there
are because of this. But when you move spirally

244
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:13,970
upward, then where do you move? You become
a personality full of compassion, of love,

245
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:24,970
of universal understanding through collective
consciousness. And, then you rise up to a

246
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:31,730
position where you become universally conscious.
So, that is what should happen to you, and

247
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:38,560
if that happens then we should say that your
motherly qualities within you have risen and

248
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,860
that’s what we have so far neglected. You
do not become a woman but you become motherly.

249
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,450
First the father, then the son, and now the
mother! All right?

250
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,990
Barbara: What is the role of woman in this
world, the role of the feminine principle?

251
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,460
Shri Mataji: I would say … I don’t say
that women as women who are born as women

252
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,730
only have the role, even the men have, everyone
has because everyone has Kundalini within

253
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:10,680
them. But the women must know that if they
are women, they have a greater responsibility.

254
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,590
Not that they should sit at home and only
look after children and brood and then nag

255
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:21,590
the husbands when they come home. [laughter]
That’s not their role. The role is such

256
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,590
that they have to be forbearing. Any person
who is the mother has to be like the Mother

257
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:36,590
Earth - how much She is forbearing, how much
She suffers! We dig Her out, we torture Her

258
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,830
life. Still, She is giving all the time; She
is soothing, forgiving, bearing it out. We

259
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,470
are doing so many sinful things, I mean, She
should explode real with anger, the way it

260
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,680
is but She does not. She is very careful.
She slowly, slowly informs that “Now get

261
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,280
out of this place, it’s rumbling.” She
is so kind, you see - that all should come

262
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,750
to us.

263
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,670
So, it’s not that it is only the women who
should settle down with these qualities, but

264
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,810
the time has come that men have to have these
qualities. Otherwise, there will be always

265
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:13,680
an imbalance. So, now the men have to become
extremely kind, affectionate, compassionate.

266
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Give up that competitive spirit, that fighting
spirit like Napoleon had - all those ideas

267
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,690
are outdated. Now, whom do you respect? People
like Mahatma Gandhi or Abraham Lincoln. Everyone,

268
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,690
an American should think of Abraham Lincoln.

269
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:38,330
Barbara: Yes, indeed. Mother, what are we
doing here? What is the purpose of life on

270
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,630
earth? What are human beings walking around
on this planet for?

271
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,110
Shri Mataji: You are specially made by God.
You are specially chosen by God to be human

272
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:53,760
beings and you are here with a very great
purpose. The first purpose of God is that

273
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,760
you should become the vehicle of God’s powers,completely.
So that He flows through you, He flows into

274
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:10,080
this atmosphere, into this universe, to make
it a divine place. When you get Realization,

275
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,080
what happens? These - all your abnormalities
drop out and you become very normal person

276
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,900
and these vibrations of Cool Breeze start
flowing. With this now you can give it to

277
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,780
Mother Earth, you can give it to the plants,
you can give it to the trees. The whole thing

278
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,780
becomes a “Garden of Allah” where you
reside in complete joy and happiness.

279
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,600
The second purpose is that God has prepared
you now to settle into His Kingdom. That’s

280
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,320
your throne. That’s your right to be there.
It could have been short circuited at a time

281
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,850
when Adam and Eve were called and told not
to go into this so-called “book of knowledge”

282
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,590
or the “fruit of knowledge.” But they
didn’t listen, you see. If you give freedom

283
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,440
to someone then, “What’s wrong?” So,
they started doing things which were brought

284
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,880
to them by a satanic force and they accepted
it. So, that was the original sin we have

285
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,309
committed. So, they had to take incarnations,
do all those things and now brought it to

286
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:18,309
this level where human beings have to be brought
again back to the position where they were

287
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,880
to go.

288
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,620
Barabara: Mother, what is the true nature
of death? Is it possible that you can choose

289
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,590
not to die? What’s the purpose of death?

290
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:35,010
Shri Mataji: See, death is just like changing
your clothes. So sometimes when you use too

291
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:40,260
much of your clothes you get tired. You want
to change it. Like that death is. Nobody dies,

292
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,730
there’s nothing that dies except that the
part that is the Mother Earth and the part

293
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:52,240
that is the water falls off, and you remain
as you are. But if you are a realized soul,

294
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,440
then you have a choice. If you want to be
born again, you would like to be born. If

295
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,130
you don’t want to be born, you will not
be born. But after Realization, it becomes

296
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,630
your choice. If you want to die, you can die.
If you don’t want to die, you need not die.

297
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:14,630
But you want because you think that “Let
us die and come back as new people again to

298
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,870
help Mother.”

299
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:24,870
Barbara: Many of us have heard discussions
or read in books about the evolution of matter,

300
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,150
the evolution of substance. What are Your
views on evolving matter and how does this

301
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,030
relate to our own physical matter in our bodies,
in our cells?

302
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:42,350
Shri Mataji: For the matter did go into evolution,
you know that, and when the carbon was established,

303
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,809
actually our first Chakra was established.
That’s carbon which is tetravalent and carbon

304
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:53,880
is the one which started producing amino acids,
you see. When amino acid started manifesting

305
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,880
itself this, then the other processes took
place by which the evolution of,say, from

306
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,960
amoeba to human stage took place. That also
we understand very well after getting Realization,

307
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,960
how we became from amoeba to human stage;
and after human stage we have to achieve our

308
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:23,390
Self Realization, means the Spirit which is
in our heart has to manifest in our attention,

309
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:29,380
or we have to feel it on central nervous system.
But what is the relationship between matter

310
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,550
and this? We should see that point. It’s
important.

311
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:38,030
Now, through the matter all our centers are
made. For example, the two centers that are

312
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:44,790
down below are made of the Mother Earth principle.
And, then another one and another one like

313
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:51,330
that. All these elements have contributed
to make the centers. And, these centers are

314
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,860
just like mirrors made and the reflection
of the Divine falls on them. Then, at a human

315
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,860
level the matter improves so much, goes into
such evolutionary processes, that the reflection

316
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,160
at the heart level improves so much that the
Spirit shines there,and the Kundalini is properly

317
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,970
set for your evolution which is the epitome
of evolution. Like this instrument that is

318
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,110
made one by one first collecting this part,
that part, that part then put together. Now

319
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,070
the time has come for you to be put to the
mains. Now, this has nothing to do with the

320
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,630
electricity if you see. It exists without
electricity but it can carry the electricity.

321
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,720
In the same way, we become the lamp and when
we become the lamp, the light can be brought

322
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,290
in and we become enlightened. So, there is
a big relationship between the lamp and the

323
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,890
light but light cannot exist without the lamp,
so lamp has to be there.

324
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,420
Barbara: Mother, can I ask you a question
about sex?

325
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,670
Shri Mataji: Yes please. [laughter]

326
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,190
Barbara: It was stated today that sex has
nothing to do with evolution the way it’s

327
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,550
been described in Sahaja Yoga. What does this
mean?

328
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:08,700
Shri Mataji: You see the thing is that we
think that by doing sex or by going into sex

329
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,730
we can evolve. It’s absolutely falsehood.
You have not become a human being from amoeba

330
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:20,540
to this stage by doing sex. Because animals
all do sex; everybody does sex. If they do

331
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,550
it or not, makes no difference! The thing
is the evolution takes place only through

332
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:32,340
your seeking. When you start seeking something
then only you evolve. And, the seeking first

333
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,900
was for food. If you see in the animals was
for food. You see, sex was spontaneous, they

334
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,570
don’t think about it, they don’t read
about it, they don’t have any education

335
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,220
about it – nothing. Sex comes out spontaneously,
just like your breathing you see. You don’t

336
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,090
have to have as you have in your schools now
teaching sex. What is there to teach I don’t

337
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:52,950
understand, I mean? It is such a spontaneous
thing. On the contrary, the more you talk

338
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:58,380
about it, the worst it becomes, you see. And,
the more it becomes the brain thing, you cannot

339
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,240
do sex with your brain, you see. [laughter]
So, it’s all a nonsensical thing. All these

340
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,880
things have added to your problems of impotency
and all sorts of things in this country. Too

341
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,140
much thinking about sex, at the time of sex
you are nowhere, you are lost. So, what’s

342
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:18,240
the use of such a life, you see? So, the people
who think about sex too much are really very

343
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,840
unnatural people, they are very unnatural.

344
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,780
To be natural is to keep it spontaneous, to
live very spontaneously. Of course, as an

345
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:32,429
Indian lady it is too much to speak on details
but I would say that… [laughter]. We are

346
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:38,990
not supposed to even say the word “sex”
in Indian life, you see, it’s like that,

347
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,280
you see, but I think we are very potent people.
The amount of children we are producing, you

348
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:51,280
can never produce even if you want to. [laughter]

349
00:33:53,530 --> 00:34:00,530
So, now the thing is that as a Mother I give
all sort of grace to these people, grace marks

350
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,069
I should say, when they said that the sex
can take you to Kundalini. Because you know,

351
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:18,069
in the beginning they must have tried something
like that and they must have seen the expression

352
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:27,099
of the deity which has got a trunk, you see,
which is settled on this center. We call it

353
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:34,269
as Ganapati who actually incarnated as Christ
on this earth later on. But He is the Ganapati.

354
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:39,519
And, there you see just the trunk and they
must have misunderstood that this trunk is

355
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,720
the Kundalini because it has a shape like
that. And, that’s why they might have said

356
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,859
it, but it’s the most dangerous thing. If
you go through sex, then you are open yourself

357
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:56,859
absolutely to hell. If you go towards sex
and try to come to God, it’s absolutely

358
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:58,390
wrong, you see.

359
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:04,099
Christ has gone to such a limit because Christ
was born here and He looks after our all optic

360
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:10,650
lobes and all this part of the eyes. And,
what He said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous

361
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,769
eyes.”

362
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:18,749
Just see. What does that mean? That means
you have innocent eyes. He was innocence.

363
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:23,549
He was the embodiment of innocence. “Thou
shalt not have adulterous eyes.” No lust

364
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:28,829
and no greed in your eyes. Now, is only possible
is if Christ is awakened within you. Once

365
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:34,630
He is awakened within you, then you will have
your innocence and you will also lose the

366
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:41,359
lust from your eyes. Eyes will be absolutely
looking, but not getting involved. That sort

367
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,960
of a thing will happen to you.

368
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,960
So, the sex which is a normal thing to do
has to be sanctified by collective people.

369
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,519
Should be done in a proper way so that you
get good children. The marriage should be

370
00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:01,380
sanctified collectively and should be done
in a proper way and should be looked after.

371
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,239
Because now of course people are on a different
line but when I had come ten years back, when

372
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:12,269
I told them that you have to have sanity about
sex, they were very angry and they said, “You

373
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:16,400
are Victorian.” They called Me Queen Victoria.
[laughter]

374
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,009
But now I think they have learnt a lesson
because I had told them, I had told them that

375
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:26,680
“You will get a disease which you will not
be able to work on. Don’t do all this nonsense

376
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,940
of perversion. It’s very nonsensical.”
But even now they are trying to evade the

377
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,739
issue. Don’t try to evade the issue. You
can be cured of that disease if you can awaken

378
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:41,089
your innocence within yourself. Through the
grace of Christ only we can do it.

379
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:48,089
Barbara: Mother, we have learned, heard that
when we learn love then we shall have will.

380
00:36:49,789 --> 00:36:52,910
What is the relationship between love and
will?

381
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:59,910
Shri Mataji: When we’ll have love, then
we’ll have will. Good! Love is when you

382
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,690
become the Spirit, because Spirit is nothing
but God’s love. – is All Pervading Power,

383
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:13,109
is Spirit. So, when you know that love which
is not attachment - it’s not attachment,

384
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:20,109
you see, like a sap rises in the tree, it
goes even to the trunk, and then to the branches,

385
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,920
to the leaves, to the flowers, to everyone.
It doesn’t settle down into one flower.

386
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,450
If it does, then the flower dies and the tree
also dies. So, it is not attached, but it

387
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:42,450
is nourishing. It does what it has to do.
That kind of a love which is absolutely without

388
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,239
any conditions, unconditional, without any
lust, without any greed - that kind of a love

389
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:53,170
when you will know. That is only possible
when you will become the Spirit. Then you

390
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,690
will know the Will of God. The Will of God
- what is to be done, because you don’t

391
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:58,940
know.

392
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:05,930
When you get your Realization what happens
is this Cool Breeze is like a computer working.

393
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,989
You ask the computer, “Now, should I do
this work?”

394
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:14,150
If it is yes, you will have cool vibrations.
If not, no vibrations. So, you will know His

395
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:21,150
Will. Thy Will be done, you see. How do you
know His Will? Then you just know. You become

396
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,549
the knowledge. When you become the knowledge,
when you become the love, then you become

397
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:30,170
the knowledge also. Even in everyday life,
if you love somebody you know a lot about

398
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,489
that person.

399
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:37,359
Barbara: Mother, this afternoon You said something
very interesting in response to a question

400
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:44,359
by a woman. And, the response that You gave
was, “Service and sacrifice are a myth,

401
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,349
or is a myth.” Can you describe what You
meant by that?

402
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:52,099
Shri Mataji: Yah. You see, when I said that,
when you become a saint, in the sense when

403
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:57,140
you become a realized soul, you find that
you are collectively conscious. Then what

404
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,890
happens that if somebody has got a problem
you feel it on your fingertips. Now, you rub

405
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,089
your fingertips and the person feels all right.
Now, you have done no service, you have done

406
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,759
no sacrifice. It’s your finger that is in
trouble. Now, if you rub your finger, who

407
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:17,630
is the other? You see this comes out of ignorance
and those … in India actually, they knew

408
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,849
it so well that those people who talked of
sacrifice and service were called as Shudras,

409
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:29,009
means untouchables. That means they had no
knowledge about it. Those people who talked

410
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:33,249
that, “We’ll serve you; we’ll do this
dirty work of yours, that dirty work of yours”

411
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:37,349
– they were called as Shudras. They are
not the people who should be touched because

412
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:44,349
they have no awareness that the All Pervading
Power of God is there which does everything.

413
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,309
What you have to do is to just become one
with It.

414
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:53,200
And, once you are one with the whole Primordial
Being, say, on your body if there is a pain

415
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,880
somewhere, you just rub it. All right, you
rub it and it’s all right. There’s no

416
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,289
obligation on it. In anyway you have not served
anyone, you have not obliged anyone. So, the

417
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:08,289
concept that you are one with the Whole itself
is the noble’s concept. And, those people

418
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,460
who do not have that concept cannot understand.

419
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,829
They think, “We are serving others; we are
looking after others.”

420
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:19,069
“Who is the other?” I ask them. Who is
the other?”

421
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:23,509
That is why this is the concept with which
Indians have always lived. And, that’s something

422
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:27,630
good they have. But they also picked up - you
see, when your missionaries went there they

423
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,799
also started their missions, this, that, serving
and serving and all that.

424
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:39,109
Now, to the poor people, now how do we serve?
We serve in this way in Sahaja Yoga that once

425
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:43,539
they get their Realization they don’t remain
so poor at all. You see because first of all

426
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:48,599
the poor people have bad habits of drinking
- all those things drop out. So, all that

427
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,489
money doesn’t go into nonsensical thing.

428
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:58,489
Secondly, they get those vibrations. Now,
whatever work they are in they become dynamic.

429
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:03,999
They have no health problem. They don’t
have to go to the doctors. They become healthy

430
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:08,339
people. Mentally, they are so alert that they
do better than any other.

431
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:14,309
We have seen people who came to Me and said
that, “Our children are very bad at school.

432
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,450
Must do something about them.”

433
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,640
When they got their Realization, now they
stood first. They got all the scholarships,

434
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,529
everything. They are doing so well. So, such
people become also materially better off.

435
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:30,549
They don’t become extraordinarily rich but
they become materially well-off, satisfied

436
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:35,940
people. You see, also dissatisfaction is another
poverty because you are dissatisfied. I think

437
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,130
those are the greatest poor people because
they are never satisfied. But the people who

438
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:48,130
are realized souls are satisfied souls. They
know how to live well and they are helped.

439
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,009
Like Krishna has said it, “Yogakshema Vahamyaham”.

440
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,869
He said, “I’ll give you Kshema after Yoga.”

441
00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:00,940
First He said “Yog.” “Kshema” means
your well-being. So, well-being acts after

442
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,279
Yoga, not before.

443
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:09,470
Barbara: Mother, in the West there is a great,
especially I would say in this part of the

444
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:16,470
West – in the West Coast, there is a great
interest in subjects such as kabala, tarot,

445
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:24,640
astrology, spiritual alchemy. How does Sahaja
Yoga relate to these? What are Your views?

446
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,739
Shri Mataji: I can’t understand. That means
they are not seekers those who have such interest,

447
00:42:27,739 --> 00:42:30,430
you see, because these things relate to a
material life.

448
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,180
Barbara: How do they relate to material life?

449
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,470
Shri Mataji: You see, because kabala will
tell you when will you get married, or how

450
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,339
much money you’ll have, what race you’ll
win. All those things, you see. God has no

451
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:45,710
interest in these things, you see. All these
things are … spiritual alchemy – how will

452
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,509
you change this into gold. And, what does
it matter? Gold and all those things - what

453
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:57,509
are so important? Isn’t it? The most important
thing is to be your Spirit. And, those who

454
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,970
are seeking the Spirit are real seekers. All
others are seeking money in some other form,

455
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,950
you see, and then when they go to these people
- actually these are nothing but spirits and

456
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:13,619
they get possessed by spirits and they have
horrible time, you see. One should never indulge

457
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:19,049
into these things. Christ has warned the most
of all and we are doing it. So often, it’s

458
00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:24,420
very wrong to ask for anything material like
that. Why should we have easy money like that?

459
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,069
It’s not good I think, through some spirit
helping you or something. I don’t know if

460
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,539
it really helps. It may little bit help but
give you later trouble.

461
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:39,539
Like, one lady had a problem with her husband,
you see. She said that, “He is a bad man;

462
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:40,690
he‘s a flirt and all that.”

463
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:45,419
She went to such a women and he became as
far as she is concerned, he gave up flirting

464
00:43:45,419 --> 00:43:50,079
- but he started racing. And, he got lost
in racing. Then she went there and she said

465
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,739
that, “Now, he should be all right from
racing. He should get out.”

466
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:58,269
So, he started drinking. And, after sometime
he started doing all the three things, you

467
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,470
see. So, it was too much.

468
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,930
So, this kind of a nonsense you should not
indulge into if you are seekers. But there

469
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:09,160
are category of people who are seekers. That’s
what I feel, and those who are seekers are

470
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,369
getting into it should get out of it and get
to your Spirit.

471
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:18,279
Barbara: What’s the role of the artist in
this work, this Sahaja Yoga?

472
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:19,289
Shri Mataji: Who?

473
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,650
Barbara: An artist, artistic work like music…

474
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,119
Shri Mataji: Oh, great, great! Tremendous
it is! You see, those people who have been

475
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:33,119
realized souls have created eternal art. Like
we can say, Michelangelo was a realized soul.

476
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:38,910
So his work is eternal art. And, they produce
art which creates vibrations. You can feel

477
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,329
vibrations from him. In the whole church if
you go you feel horrid, but when you go to

478
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:49,269
Sistine Chapel and see his work, the whole
thing fills you up with vibrations. They are

479
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:56,269
creators of vibrations. Imagine! The musicians
like Mozart - Mozart creates vibrations but

480
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,499
Wagner… [laughter]

481
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:05,499
You see. So, they are the people who are realized
souls. You have some tennis players who are

482
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,140
realized souls also, perhaps you…

483
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,140
Barbara: Tennis players?

484
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,559
Shri Mataji: Yah! MacEnroe is a realized soul
and Borg is also. And, My grandchild told

485
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:20,979
Me, “You know, why Borg has retired? Because
another Sahaja Yogi has come now, the younger

486
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:25,509
one, so give chance to him and that’s why
he is very honorably retired.” [laughter]

487
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:29,640
Is because when MacEnroe speaks, you must
have seen, he tells himself “John, now behave

488
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,190
yourself.”

489
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,329
They are in the third person. And, that’s
why people don’t understand him and he doesn’t

490
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:41,150
like to be insulted. And, that’s very true.
Anybody who is a saint doesn’t like him

491
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:43,989
to be insulted. So, like that you have so
many people who are realized souls, we can

492
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:50,299
say. Even the Princess of Wales is a realized
soul and the new child is a realized soul.

493
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:53,869
So, there are so many people like that who
are realized souls.

494
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:59,150
Barbara: The listeners who will be tuning
in to this program on the radio won’t have

495
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,089
had the experience of being in Your presence.
Some of them may have who were in this room.

496
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:09,989
What can you say to them about how to become
a realized soul, how to achieve this Cool

497
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:11,349
Breeze that comes from…

498
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:15,059
Shri Mataji: At the beginning of My lecture,
if you tell them that they should put their

499
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:21,630
hands towards the radio. Just on the radio.
They might feel the Cool Breeze. If they don’t

500
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:25,200
feel it, then tell them to put the right hand
first till they feel the cool breeze, and

501
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,630
left hand up as if ventilating out. And, then
the left hand towards the radio and the right

502
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,489
hand up. It might work out because it has
worked in Hong Kong. [laughter]

503
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:41,539
Barbara: I’ll tell You something interesting.
I interviewed Danny and Doug before You came

504
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:46,039
so that listeners would have a chance to come
here. And, one of them called me and said

505
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,849
that he went into meditation in the afternoon
and felt the Cool Breeze just by hearing them

506
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,339
talk.

507
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:58,339
Shri Mataji: See, if Sahaja Yogis can do it
then when I’m talking it should happen.

508
00:46:59,239 --> 00:46:59,739
[laughter]

509
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:06,309
Barbara: We are about at the end of the interview
and what I want to do now, Mother, is give

510
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:11,849
You a chance to say what’s in Your heart
to say. What is there that You wish to share

511
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,049
that has not been said this evening?

512
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:20,150
Shri Mataji: I have to say that America is
a great country in the universe. It has the

513
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:27,150
place of the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is the
center of responsibility and discretion. And,

514
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:33,999
they have been so responsible. So far they
have given such noble ideas of democracy and

515
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:40,999
of freedom and all those things which are
really all belonging to God’s ideas. And,

516
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:48,099
when they talk of all these things, we must
know that there is something much more that

517
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:52,759
they can give to the whole world. So many
saints are born in this country because they

518
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:57,969
realize that this is the country where they’ll
be able to prosper better into their spirituality.

519
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:04,809
So, it is a very great responsibility of Americans
to understand that we have had great leaders,

520
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:09,769
we have had great noble ideals, we have had
got great saints living here. So many are

521
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:15,319
anxious to come down here. Only thing what
we have to do is to establish within ourselves

522
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:20,910
our Spirit, and to be ready and prepared for
this great, tremendous work that is going

523
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:27,910
to come now. And, this is what the world has
to do. If emancipation of the humanity has

524
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:33,049
to take place, it has to take place only from
inside out and not outside in.

525
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:38,769
Another thing, I would like to tell that the
danger is not from outside for America, not

526
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:44,619
from anywhere else. It is from within themselves.
So be careful. We have to be careful about

527
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:49,940
ourselves - the way we are destroying. When
we say, “What’s wrong?” we go head long

528
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:56,180
into our destructions. Human beings should
not take freedom as abandonment, but freedom

529
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:03,180
to enjoy completely and fully. The freedom
that takes you to a destruction is not freedom.

530
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:08,680
The right idea of freedom must be taken. And,
people should know that freedom, ultimate

531
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:15,680
freedom, is when you become your own master,
when there are no habits, when you cannot

532
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,989
be dominated by anything. You are above everything.
That’s the freedom you have to achieve,

533
00:49:21,989 --> 00:49:26,549
and that is why people talked long time back
in this country about freedom. They helped

534
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:32,579
all the countries to get their freedom, and
now it is their job to get them their own

535
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,369
freedom within themselves so that others will
also follow.

536
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:43,369
May God bless 

537
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:59,499
you all.

538
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:06,499
Barbara: Thank you, Mother.
