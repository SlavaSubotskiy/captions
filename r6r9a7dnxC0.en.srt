1
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:04,209
I bow to all the sahaja yogis of the world.

2
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:19,083
It is very heartening

3
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:25,209
to see so many of you assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

4
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:47,417
To worship your Guru in person is regarded as the highest blessing.

5
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:04,584
But in My case it’s a very different combination

6
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,876
that I am your Mother and your Guru.

7
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:23,792
So you can understand how Shri Ganesha worshipped his Mother.

8
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,209
You all are created in the same image of Shri Ganesha

9
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,417
who worshipped His Mother

10
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,918
and then He became the Adi Guru, the first Guru.

11
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:57,792
He is the primordial essence of mastery.

12
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:08,250
Only the Mother can make the child a master.

13
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:15,542
And the motherhood in any Guru – whether male or female –

14
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:20,042
can only make the disciple a Guru.

15
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,501
So, first you have to become the prophets

16
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:37,584
and develop that motherhood within yourself,

17
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:44,083
then you can make others also prophets.

18
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:01,209
Now, to become a Guru,

19
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:08,876
what do we have to do after our realisation?

20
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,584
Guru word means gravity.

21
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:26,542
Gravity means a person who is grave

22
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:32,000
who is deep, who is magnetic.

23
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,918
Now as you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga

24
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,417
that realisation takes place in complete effortlessness.

25
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:02,959
So normally a Guru tries to make his disciples effortless,

26
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:16,751
which is called as prayatna shaytilya – means ‘relax your efforts‘.

27
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,584
Without doing anything you got

28
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,959
your prayatna shaytilya, otherwise Kundalini would not have risen.

29
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:48,334
Then the second stage is vichara shaithilya – the thoughtless awareness.

30
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,417
This also you got it without doing anything.

31
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:10,709
And the third is complete negation of thought, abhava,

32
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,209
and the bliss of peace.

33
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,042
So one has to understand that

34
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:28,125
you have to pass then, through three stages.

35
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,709
First, when you get your realisation

36
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:40,999
all these things come spontaneously, for that moment.

37
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,417
When you raise the Kundalini of others,

38
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:54,584
these things happen to them spontaneously.

39
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,250
You too have that power now

40
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:05,999
to raise the Kundalini of people and to establish it in them.

41
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,626
But we must understand why it has to be done that way,

42
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,751
why we have to have vichara shaithilya –

43
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:33,250
because when you project any thought,

44
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,250
it is artificial,

45
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,459
it is not reality.

46
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:48,375
Thought always stands between you and the reality.

47
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:59,918
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

48
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:15,334
For example, if I have to cure you

49
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,834
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

50
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,334
because I am that.

51
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:34,999
You get your realisation because I am that.

52
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,959
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

53
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:52,876
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

54
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,751
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

55
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:11,792
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

56
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:21,000
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

57
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,167
You can get an example from gold.

58
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,000
Now gold is untarnishable

59
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,083
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

60
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:41,250
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

61
00:15:54,083 --> 00:16:00,959
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

62
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,042
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

63
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:19,626
If you look at the sun – it shines.

64
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:24,918
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

65
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,918
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

66
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,918
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

67
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:55,667
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

68
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,417
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

69
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:11,083
if you are that,  if you have already become,

70
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,000
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

71
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,959
But when we say these things, you see,

72
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,751
then people think you have to be lethargic,

73
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,709
that you need not do anything,

74
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,250
you become a Guru without doing anything.

75
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:56,709
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

76
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,501
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

77
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,999
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

78
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,834
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

79
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,417
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

80
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:27,584
but surrendering means the worship,

81
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,792
the respect of the higher,

82
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,876
the obedience to the higher.

83
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:55,751
Not to argue it out,

84
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:03,125
not to react, acceptance,

85
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:10,876
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

86
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,125
without questioning, without reasoning.

87
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,959
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

88
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:31,792
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

89
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,542
So first is the state,

90
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:39,083
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

91
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:47,709
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

92
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:58,292
If you can develop childhood first,

93
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,876
then everything takes proper course,

94
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,999
because maturity cannot take place unless

95
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,876
and until you start from the very beginning,

96
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:29,584
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

97
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,959
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

98
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:41,459
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

99
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:50,876
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

100
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,876
So try to develop your discretion power

101
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:11,584
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

102
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,083
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

103
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:31,959
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

104
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:42,334
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

105
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:46,999
or anti-innocence must be negated.

106
00:21:54,542 --> 00:22:02,375
So the negation of effort

107
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:08,792
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

108
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:17,999
means the effort of negation.

109
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,375
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

110
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,834
you will have to put in effort for that.

111
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,918
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

112
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,876
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

113
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:10,000
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

114
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:16,501
from effort that makes it adulterous.

115
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,834
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

116
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,792
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

117
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:46,626
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

118
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,000
So those people who have come now,

119
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:03,000
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

120
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,626
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

121
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,375
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

122
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,083
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

123
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:29,334
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

124
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:42,501
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

125
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,918
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

126
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,417
Some people have an attention

127
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,626
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

128
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,209
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

129
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:31,918
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

130
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:41,375
So the effort that you put in

131
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:46,083
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:25:54,584 --> 00:25:56,667
Another thing is very common, in the West,

133
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,834
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

134
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,834
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

135
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:20,709
Or if they are really blunt

136
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:25,709
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

137
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,876
Such people should stop talking

138
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:38,334
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

139
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:46,709
Now watch your mind – is it

140
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:50,709
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

141
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,375
So, this watching also requires effort.

142
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,292
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

143
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:20,375
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

144
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:38,667
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

145
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:50,834
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

146
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:54,334
against the mind which you have built in,

147
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:56,459
through your ego or superego,

148
00:27:56,626 --> 00:28:00,918
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

149
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:20,792
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

150
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:35,125
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

151
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:38,709
never go to any extreme of anything.

152
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,459
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

153
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:55,542
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

154
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,542
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

155
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,667
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

156
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,167
There is nothing wrong in those things,

157
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,876
but whatever you achieve in all these things

158
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,209
must be brought back to the collective

159
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:25,751
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

160
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,083
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

161
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:51,667
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

162
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:03,959
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

163
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:14,459
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

164
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:26,959
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

165
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,000
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

166
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:51,709
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

167
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:56,250
– suggest, autosuggestion,

168
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:08,751
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

169
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:14,334
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

170
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,709
of these virtues and righteousness,

171
00:31:32,751 --> 00:31:37,375
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

172
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:42,083
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

173
00:31:54,876 --> 00:31:57,667
For example, somebody is a miserly person

174
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,083
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

175
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,417
then you can call him a hypocrite.

176
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:13,000
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

177
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:16,125
then he is not a hypocrite.

178
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:32,626
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

179
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:38,792
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

180
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:43,459
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

181
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:45,999
then you become that.

182
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,751
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

183
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:25,667
and you know what’s wrong with you.

184
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:32,000
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

185
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,918
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

186
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:43,501
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

187
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:51,125
But in this also human brain has an escape.

188
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,417
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

189
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:02,542
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

190
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:16,375
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

191
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:18,751
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

192
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,209
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

193
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:30,918
to get all kinds of filth in it

194
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,417
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

195
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,792
It’s like any lousy housewife –

196
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,542
she takes all the dirt of the house

197
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:53,584
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

198
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,250
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

199
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,292
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

200
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:19,709
And that’s how you become powerful.

201
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,042
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

202
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:27,417
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

203
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:34,501
And when your machinery is out of gear,

204
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:36,209
you put it in a lock and key,

205
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,834
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

206
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,834
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

207
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,751
something else other than you.

208
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,250
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

209
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:08,501
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

210
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:20,459
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

211
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:26,834
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

212
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:31,751
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

213
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:44,459
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

214
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:50,000
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

215
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,959
and they think they are big gurus,

216
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,000
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

217
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,042
And if you ask them,

218
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:09,834
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

219
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,959
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

220
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,626
that I should really keep you clean.

221
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,709
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

222
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:44,834
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

223
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:49,417
and give those flowers to the Deity.

224
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:59,584
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

225
00:37:59,999 --> 00:38:02,375
but once you become the guru

226
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:05,542
then I become your Deity.

227
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:17,125
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

228
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,542
Till they reach that state.

229
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:24,167
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

230
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:39,834
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

231
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,375
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

232
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,125
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

233
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:54,501
He talked of the resurrection,

234
00:38:54,876 --> 00:38:57,667
because He was a Guru.

235
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:02,417
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

236
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,250
pointing out towards the point where

237
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:09,709
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

238
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,167
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

239
00:39:29,876 --> 00:39:33,709
So till you become your own guru,

240
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,709
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

241
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,959
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

242
00:39:55,918 --> 00:40:00,000
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

243
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,626
but you can verify it.

244
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:10,250
A person who is discrete –

245
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:14,167
in his presence others become discrete.

246
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:26,792
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

247
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:35,834
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

248
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,459
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

249
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:49,250
When you are the guru, you are the example.

250
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,999
You have to be the example.

251
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,250
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

252
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,250
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

253
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,999
types of life: like professors, teachers,

254
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,417
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

255
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:21,792
They too, when they try

256
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,417
to follow a mundane type of life –

257
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,999
not of something exceptional –

258
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:32,584
then their disciples lose faith in them.

259
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,334
Even political leaders, when they…

260
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:54,125
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

261
00:41:54,709 --> 00:42:03,250
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

262
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:17,250
So they too have to have a personal character,

263
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:20,292
a personal value system.

264
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:32,834
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

265
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,125
They have to be excellent people.

266
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:48,709
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

267
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,751
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

268
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:11,584
and that is what one has to do –

269
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:18,125
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

270
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:27,375
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

271
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:31,250
but inside has to go outside.

272
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:38,751
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

273
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:47,209
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

274
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:53,999
This is very important in the West

275
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:58,417
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

276
00:43:58,751 --> 00:44:00,918
of a gross nature.

277
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,667
For example,

278
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:17,167
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

279
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:28,042
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

280
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,792
everything clean, you see,

281
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:33,042
very particular about keeping every place clean.

282
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:46,542
All the gross things they keep clean,

283
00:44:56,334 --> 00:45:05,250
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

284
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,584
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

285
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,626
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

286
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:28,000
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

287
00:45:31,626 --> 00:45:33,375
it’s poison inside.

288
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:37,292
And they like that poison to be taken out –

289
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:40,334
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

290
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:49,501
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

291
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:59,626
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

292
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:08,417
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

293
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,626
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

294
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,167
they are fighting for.

295
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:25,709
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

296
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:29,918
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

297
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:44,459
This filth is very sophisticated.

298
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:51,417
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

299
00:46:51,667 --> 00:46:55,834
artificial things to get a fragrance.

300
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:02,083
Inside has to be clean

301
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:08,999
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

302
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,250
Watch your mind –

303
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:21,999
how does it think about others?

304
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:28,876
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

305
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,334
I have seen people who are very well placed,

306
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:41,167
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

307
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:48,042
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

308
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:54,250
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

309
00:47:54,626 --> 00:48:00,167
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

310
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:21,417
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

311
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:31,167
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

312
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,459
So the mind is dirty,

313
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:50,667
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

314
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:59,167
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

315
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:02,834
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

316
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:12,542
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

317
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:18,501
Like the other day I asked someone,

318
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:21,542
“Why the father is angry with the son,

319
00:49:28,626 --> 00:49:31,626
and with his own brother?”

320
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:34,000
So the answer was, “Because

321
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:38,584
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

322
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,417
Normally any person should be thankful

323
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:08,125
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

324
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,042
But the fellow is jealous

325
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,250
because of possessiveness

326
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,792
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

327
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,667
and insecurity comes within us

328
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:32,167
because we make others insecured.

329
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:43,709
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

330
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:48,000
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

331
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:04,083
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

332
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:07,709
with greater effort than the outside filth,

333
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,918
and that inside filth

334
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:22,584
you can watch and see within yourself.

335
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:36,626
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

336
00:51:36,876 --> 00:51:39,584
just for the bossiness of it.

337
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:56,542
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

338
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,209
Have you mastered yourself enough?

339
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:12,459
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

340
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:23,667
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

341
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:26,501
to master them.

342
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:39,209
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

343
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:45,125
He becomes the master.

344
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:49,042
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

345
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:56,999
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

346
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:06,334
so many things by which he can correct.

347
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:18,751
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

348
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:29,667
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

349
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:42,792
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

350
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,626
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

351
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:53,375
simple, innocent looking,

352
00:54:03,709 --> 00:54:08,834
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

353
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:16,876
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

354
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:33,751
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

355
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:46,292
I mean, the way things happen in life,

356
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:51,125
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

357
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:04,209
someone knows everything.

358
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:11,918
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

359
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:24,792
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

360
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:35,501
who is a Sat Guru.

361
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:45,918
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

362
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:54,167
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

363
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:03,584
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

364
00:56:03,918 --> 00:56:06,292
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

365
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:10,000
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

366
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:15,167
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

367
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:40,375
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

368
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:50,999
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

369
00:56:54,167 --> 00:57:00,709
It’s such a short method – just to become.

370
00:57:02,792 --> 00:57:04,918
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

371
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:08,334
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

372
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:16,167
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

373
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:19,751
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

374
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,959
not about yourself.

375
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,876
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

376
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,792
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

377
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:51,999
Now, that is very important

378
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:58,000
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

379
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:12,751
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

380
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:17,709
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

381
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:20,834
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

382
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:25,709
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

383
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:46,918
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

384
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:51,918
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

385
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,918
their power of innocence.

386
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,292
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

387
00:59:15,834 --> 00:59:18,425
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

388
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:22,769
Not only by becoming but now,

389
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:26,769
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

390
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:42,978
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

391
00:59:56,435 --> 01:00:00,936
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

392
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:12,894
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

393
01:00:13,227 --> 01:00:16,310
had control over elements.

394
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:27,894
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

395
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:37,644
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

396
01:00:38,477 --> 01:00:41,060
He is born,

397
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:46,519
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

398
01:00:57,894 --> 01:01:05,561
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

399
01:01:12,894 --> 01:01:18,978
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

400
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,561
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

401
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:42,269
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

402
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:46,894
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

403
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:58,310
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

404
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:01,477
you control all the elements.

405
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:15,227
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

406
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:22,435
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

407
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:36,102
And one should understand whatever we are today,

408
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:42,686
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

409
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:56,686
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

410
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:03,185
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

411
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:15,686
The lotus will invite many insects

412
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:20,519
and will convert them into lotuses.

413
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,477
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

414
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,978
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

415
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,644
the… what do you call? – the honey.

416
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:53,644
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

417
01:04:02,978 --> 01:04:10,686
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

418
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:23,894
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

419
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:34,394
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

420
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:47,852
She resides in the heart on the platform,

421
01:04:48,143 --> 01:04:51,352
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

422
01:04:56,811 --> 01:05:01,978
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

423
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:12,059
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

424
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:18,519
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

425
01:05:18,978 --> 01:05:22,435
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

426
01:05:29,435 --> 01:05:33,394
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

427
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:40,019
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

428
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,310
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

429
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:45,310
should shine through you.

430
01:05:55,394 --> 01:05:57,185
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

431
01:05:57,394 --> 01:06:01,227
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

432
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:13,143
Then you ascend.

433
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:18,978
Then you become one with the Viraata

434
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:26,019
and then you can give Dharma to others.

435
01:06:30,852 --> 01:06:34,352
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

436
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:37,102
and you do not become a hypocrite.

437
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:47,019
But you become real

438
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:55,102
and the reality is shown by its own being.

439
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,769
That is how you become.

440
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:06,310
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

441
01:07:06,644 --> 01:07:09,185
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

442
01:07:09,352 --> 01:07:10,769
“No, Mother I am not like that.

443
01:07:11,019 --> 01:07:14,227
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

444
01:07:28,686 --> 01:07:31,310
Some such people would like to sit in front

445
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,811
or sort of try to show off or anything,

446
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:35,059
but that is not important.

447
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:37,477
What is important is how much you know yourself,

448
01:07:37,644 --> 01:07:39,477
it is Self-realisation.

449
01:07:51,102 --> 01:07:55,602
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

450
01:07:59,978 --> 01:08:01,727
and not artificially,

451
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,059
and then the enjoyment is complete.

452
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:13,936
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

453
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:20,852
But human beings have to become the bee.

454
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:34,059
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

455
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:40,852
Today I bless you.

456
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:51,059
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

457
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:57,852
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

458
01:09:12,978 --> 01:09:20,477
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

459
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:29,019
everything, has spared no efforts

460
01:09:30,852 --> 01:09:38,143
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

461
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:41,894
into this becoming of you people.

462
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:58,769
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

463
01:10:02,978 --> 01:10:06,852
Look at yourself, help yourself

464
01:10:08,644 --> 01:10:14,644
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

465
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:22,686
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

466
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,185
And once you become the Guru,

467
01:10:28,394 --> 01:10:33,060
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

468
01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:45,477
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

469
01:10:46,269 --> 01:10:49,602
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

470
01:10:55,019 --> 01:10:59,686
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

471
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:10,936
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

472
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,936
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

473
01:11:19,394 --> 01:11:22,519
to understand.

474
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:28,394
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

475
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:37,435
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

476
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:43,102
