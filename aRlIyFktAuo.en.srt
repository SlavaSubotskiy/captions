1
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:12,949
After seeing this love,

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,660
my heart is filled.

3
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:30,376
And I am thinking

4
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,273
that love is such a big power

5
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:39,691
by which so many people are attracted

6
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,938
and become happy.

7
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:48,902
This is such a surprising thing.

8
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,286
In this Kali Yuga,

9
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:57,461
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

10
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:08,539
I think that after seeing this,

11
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:14,918
all of you should learn to increase your love.

12
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,589
And this thing is very easy.

13
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,225
And you can do it in this way-

14
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:33,085
by meditating morning and evening,

15
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:40,233
then the bad thoughts in your mind

16
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:47,391
which cause jealousy and anger

17
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:52,336
and you get hurt by small things,

18
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:55,980
all such thoughts will end.

19
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:02,346
And after that whatâ€™s left

20
00:02:03,094 --> 00:02:06,237
its Nirmal prem.

21
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,176
With this love

22
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:12,930
you can give the whole world

23
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:17,116
a new life.

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,280
I have told them in Hindi language

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,880
that love, you can see one person's love

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,560
manifested in so many eyes here.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,480
And when I saw the enthusiasm

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,800
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,800
So one can see how powerful is this love.

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,320
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,880
and also self-destructive elements

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,600
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,000
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

34
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,000
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,800
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,920
That will give you such a strength to love others,

37
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
to forgive others;

38
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,080
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,600
you feeling irritated

40
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,840
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

41
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,600
or else sometimes

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,200
we become aggressive towards some people,

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,360
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

44
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,520
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

45
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,280
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

46
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,040
it will create more confusions.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,240
A person who has very bad vibrations,

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,280
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

49
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

50
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,720
you should not try to pacify him

51
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,800
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,880
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

53
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,040
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

54
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,360
So the best thing is to show your love

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,440
in very sweet and different manner.

56
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

57
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,760
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
who was living on a very high mountain,

59
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,680
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

60
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,360
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,680
I said, "You see the vibrations.

62
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,640
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

63
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,600
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

64
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,840
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

65
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,240
So they told us.

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,320
So I said, "I must see this man,"

67
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,880
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

68
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,960
He could control the rain. So he was

70
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,080
sitting there on a stone

71
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,320
and he was moving his head with great

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,720
agitation when I reached there.

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,920
And it was raining so heavily

74
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

75
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,960
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

76
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,360
and he came back

77
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,960
with great anger towards the rain.

78
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,760
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

79
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I said, "I didn't do that."

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

82
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,160
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,920
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,400
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,720
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

86
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,600
See, you have bought a sari for Me

87
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,280
and you are a sanyasi,

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,720
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

89
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,160
so the rain has made it convenient.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,080
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,080
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

92
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

93
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,800
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,160
what is the greatness of love,

95
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,120
how it takes you away from mundane things and

96
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,960
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

97
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,440
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,680
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,560
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

100
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,080
that you should try your love,

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,520
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

102
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,160
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

103
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,080
You should not give up.

104
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,200
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

105
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,680
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

106
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,040
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

107
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,400
and lots of friends and friendship,

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

109
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,280
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

110
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,360
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

111
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,600
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

112
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,400
Bombay people must have told them, something

113
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,320
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

114
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,200
little, little bottles - oh, my!

115
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,880
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

116
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,400
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

117
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,480
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

118
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,400
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,040
I saw them with their flags and

120
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

121
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,160
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,720
But how they were enjoying each other!

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,840
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

124
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
you won't enjoy anything else

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,640
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

126
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,240
On the contrary you will see that your body,

127
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
your mind, your thoughts,

128
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,120
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

129
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,240
and not for yourself.

130
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,000
The whole attitude changes.

131
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

132
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,760
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

133
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,200
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

134
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,440
all over," but it does.

135
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,360
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

136
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,920
you are all enlightened with love;

137
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,240
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

138
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,720
spontaneously, sahaj.

139
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,320
I was also very much

140
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,720
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

141
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
I think it's a very great blessing,

142
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,320
because these days our young children,

143
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,880
our young people are getting astray.

144
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,400
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

145
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,400
but quite a big trend is going on

146
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,920
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,320
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

148
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,640
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

149
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,000
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,840
and enjoying each other's company.

151
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
This is something has to happen

152
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
in this country and in every country;

153
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,520
that we should all feel oneness

154
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

155
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,040
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,640
which can be dried any time.

157
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,880
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,720
then what happens is that every

159
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,160
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

160
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,200
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

161
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,200
because you do not have separate identity.

162
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,320
All these things that make a separate identity

163
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,960
in our society or in our culture

164
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,880
all should be completely curbed down.

166
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,040
And this will settle many problems,

167
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,600
from family life to national life, to international life.

168
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,680
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

169
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,200
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,160
separate nation.

171
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,200
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

172
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,720
because great times are coming,

173
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,680
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

174
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,760
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

175
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,800
then things will be very much different.

176
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,040
Today it is not with them,

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,880
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

178
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,960
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

179
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,920
so they want to have separate of everything.

180
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,640
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

181
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,120
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

182
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,000
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

183
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,600
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

184
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,720
In different families we are born - after all,

185
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,280
all cannot be born in one family.

186
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

187
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

188
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,880
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

189
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,800
or separate speciality.

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We are all one with each other,

191
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,280
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

192
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,600
I was really very much touched,

193
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,560
because now the new year is coming with

194
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,440
a new challenge for all of us

195
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,800
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

197
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,920
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

198
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,520
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

199
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,200
What are the problems in another country?

200
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
Put your attention outside, not inside

201
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,800
this way that you should say

202
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,000
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

203
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,800
We should know what other people need:

204
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,880
what is their need,

205
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,520
what the people in our society, in our nation,

206
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,040
in our world require?

207
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,640
Better write them down: what do they require?

208
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,240
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

209
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

210
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,840
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

211
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,320
It will be a nice idea for all of you

212
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,240
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

213
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,360
that we have here today.

214
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,240
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

215
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
that we will be the ones who will guide

216
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:56,400
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

217
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,320
So it's very important time,

218
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,720
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

219
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
