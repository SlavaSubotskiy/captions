1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:04,333
To all the seekers of truth I bow

2
00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:11,291
I must say Dr. Warren has done a good job.

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:21,500
Perhaps you don't understand that the situation

4
00:00:21,709 --> 00:00:27,583
is quite different in the western countries.

5
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:34,125
I don't have to have any introduction in India,

6
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:38,291
nor anybody has to give any apologies all the time, you see

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,041
trying to convince getting this that into the

8
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:49,000
whole argument to prove that I'm the truth

9
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:54,166
and that I'm genuine, that there's no hanky panky about Me.

10
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:58,083
It's very embarrassing for Me to say and

11
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:02,166
the background is like this: when I came to Australia this time

12
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:06,500
from all over the world all the Sahaja yogis who are in the west,

13
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,999
we have many in every country

14
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,999
and they are known that this time Mother must say who She is

15
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:16,125
is important because the questions like this then how can You do it

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,375
how can it be easy

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,959
are You the one who is doing all kinds of questions coming

18
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,041
and I just don't help, please don't do it,

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,583
it's not easy for a western mind to accept it you see,

20
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,250
they all come on you and you see and so I told you the same

21
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,792
and it was

22
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:41,625
accepted by many people because they felt the cool breeze

23
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,834
they did feel the cool breeze coming out of their heads

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,458
but some did not and because they did not feel it, they challenged

25
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,917
and they were angry about it

26
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,917
now the position is like this

27
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:02,250
that so far if your mind has been guiding you properly

28
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,583
there was no need for Me to say it.

29
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:12,458
We are living in the atmosphere of great confusion.

30
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,458
Tremendous confusion exists.

31
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,500
We don't know what is good what is bad.

32
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,542
Some people say that it's better to have a unmarried life.

33
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,917
Some say it's better to have the married life, some say it's better

34
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,792
to keep the children out in the school, some say it is not.

35
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,625
The governments don't understand whether communism is all right

36
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:38,000
or capitalism is all right, economics is dwindling

37
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,125
they don't understand what is happening. So the result

38
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:45,542
of all our enterprises is very confusing.

39
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,750
And we don't understand really what is right and what is wrong.

40
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,166
So we use whatever we think right as the right.

41
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:59,166
But whatever we think as right, is it coming

42
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,709
from something absolute or from relative

43
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,709
because we are conditioned people?

44
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:08,542
For a lady who, say, comes from a catholic church

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,083
she won't like me to tell her that

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,834
I'm the comfort or I'm the Holy Ghost, she won't like it.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,875
But I would ask her one question:

48
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,333
supposing if I am how will she recognize me?

49
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:25,166
If supposing tomorrow Christ comes in

50
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:30,041
how would she recognize Christ? It's a very apologetic you see

51
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,875
low based stuff which really I didn't want to start it

52
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,208
because it takes you down to such a level that

53
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,333
you just don't want to talk about it but it happens.

54
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:42,583
With the western people you have to stoop down too low

55
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,792
to convince them who you are.

56
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,041
Of course you are not going to crucify Me, I know

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,917
but you'll crucify yourself if you don't accept,

58
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:54,375
that's the point, because I have a concern,

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:58,750
I have to do this job and I have to do it with great care

60
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,500
that you are very great seekers

61
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,792
you have been seeking truth for ages now

62
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:08,166
and the time has come for you to get it.

63
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,417
And this is the time your western ego stands up and says that

64
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,166
how can that be, why it is You, you see.

65
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,667
So I said all right you do it, I don't mind

66
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,750
if you can do it nothing like it

67
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,834
the problem is this ego is such a thing that

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,625
we are never aware of it that it's the ego that is working it out

69
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:34,125
like Hitler, when he destroyed people he was never aware

70
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,667
that he was doing it just to satisfy his ego.

71
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,792
He thought that what he was doing was right and all of them

72
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,083
will do such things always believing that it is right.

73
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,166
So this is a problem and then the question comes in that

74
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,291
"Mother you might be also doing it out of ego", possibly one can say.

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,959
That could be so, but what is my gain out of that ego is nothing

76
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,291
As it is you know I'm a very happily married woman

77
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,333
of a very rich family, I don't need anything from you

78
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:09,250
and in a very great position.

79
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,375
But why am I concerned is the point.

80
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,208
Now put your mind on this position

81
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,000
that just now we do not ask any questions,

82
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,875
let's have it first of all, let have your Spirit

83
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,375
if she is saying I'm going to give you the Spirit

84
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,999
all right have it no harm.

85
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,250
After all I have done no harm to anyone so far.

86
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,458
There's no one who can say that I harmed any one or

87
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,333
somebody has loss. Today with me there was a little child

88
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:38,166
with a limb hand. The child would never

89
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,667
have been cured so meningitis

90
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,750
she would never have, all the life the child would have had the limb

91
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,375
but within ten minutes with Sahaja Yoga the child was cured.

92
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:50,792
It's a fact, I'm telling you the truth but that doesn't mean

93
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,959
that you should believe Me but by believing Me you are not the loser

94
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,875
On the contrary it is just the other way round

95
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,375
the whole situation is the other way round thing.

96
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,333
It's like the river Ganges is flowing

97
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:07,667
and you have to fill your pitchers now

98
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,041
they don't expect Me to fall at your feet, all right.

99
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,542
You take your realization it's too much.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,542
But I've heard one thing that the way other incarnations

101
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,959
came and talked. Human beings are not easy people

102
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,500
they are really complicated full of their ego

103
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,959
they live with their ego, morning till evening they float with their ego

104
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,625
so they are not going to accept anything

105
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:37,000
unless and until somehow you bring it down

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,125
to a point where they receive their realization.

107
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,750
This is exactly my father told me

108
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,083
that you have such and such wishing them to do it

109
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,834
but don't write about it and don't talk about it

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,709
till you have found out an en masse method

111
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,375
by which you can give en masse realization.

112
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,625
This is my job for which I have come on this earth

113
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,333
and he told me that if you write a book it will become another bible.

114
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:03,041
If you say anything it will become another saying

115
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,959
and people will just use it to pamper their ego

116
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,709
and they have crucified all the people like this.

117
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,291
Now why in India you see

118
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,709
people understand because they are educated as I told you.

119
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:19,750
There's this book which is a prediction written by Brighmuni

120
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,667
who is the I should say the

121
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,709
originator of astrology in India.

122
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:29,875
Thousands of years back and he wrote a book called Nadi Granth

123
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,917
which was the original book he wrote in which

124
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,417
he has mentioned about these things happening.

125
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,083
Was revised 300 years back

126
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,458
and was said that in 1970 this work will start

127
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,333
by someone and I started my work in 1970.

128
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,667
Because you do not know it is so

129
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,417
describing details how to recognize a Holy Ghost.

130
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,792
Christians don't know much about Holy Ghost at all

131
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,750
I would say they don't want to know also they have never read any

132
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,333
other book to know what is the Holy Ghost is.

133
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:03,959
But there are all the descriptions in details given

134
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,333
as to how to recognize the Holy Ghost.

135
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:09,417
But I must admit that this work

136
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,917
I have never done before of giving en masse realization.

137
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,166
This is the first time I have been able

138
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,667
successfully to do this job which I have

139
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,333
to work out. It's a great penance I have to go through

140
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:29,166
by which I learned what problems human beings have.

141
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,792
Their permutations combinations everything

142
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,583
and they are so many that now you see you have

143
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:40,000
seven chakras and three gunas so 21

144
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,125
then raised to power say all these centres

145
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,166
have got different number of petals

146
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,291
raised to power all these

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,583
you have permutations and combinations

148
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,999
so you can imagine how many permutations and combinations you have

149
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,542
so first you have to be [BROUGHT?] the basic points

150
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,875
You see where the problem into the basic thing

151
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,208
and then to realize what can one do

152
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,375
to take the kundalini

153
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,792
out here

154
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:16,625
by which method one can do it, it's a technique.

155
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,999
It's the technique of the divine laws you see this is too

156
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,875
subtle a work within us but the movement

157
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,125
of the kundalini stops at the first point or at the second point

158
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,667
or at the third point.

159
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,333
now what is the method by which you can raise it you see.

160
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:35,583
Now this I had to first find out.

161
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,166
What's the problem with the human beings are.

162
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,875
So I did not only study human beings

163
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,750
but I also went to all these horrible boots

164
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,750
to find out what they are doing to you

165
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,417
how they are and very close I went to find out

166
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,959
how they are spoiling your chakras.

167
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,959
Then the drugs I studied with some people who had taken

168
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,208
drugs and all that what is going wrong with them

169
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,917
what is spoiling them. Then there are people

170
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,959
who had problems, physical problems.

171
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:07,000
To study the physical problem was very easy for Me because I know

172
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,709
what is this physical body is, but I did not know what

173
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,417
you say it in the medical terminology because these are your words

174
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,875
not of God. So I studied medicine for that.

175
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,500
Then the psychologists, I thought the psychologists are creating

176
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,166
another problem they are not understanding what they have to say

177
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,750
except for you I would say the rest of them were

178
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,792
half baked something wrong with them.

179
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:33,125
So then I realized that they are treating

180
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,709
people who are pathologically upset

181
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:39,500
or who are pathological cases

182
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,959
and they do not know how to protect themselves

183
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,375
from these pathological things you see and

184
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,875
they just handle the situation as they have.

185
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:50,750
It's like putting your hand into the hole of a snake, you see

186
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,750
and they get bitten by it and because of that you see they become

187
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,458
exactly the same what their patients are

188
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:03,208
and then they start universalizing that pathological problem

189
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:06,834
to the whole world that the person they meet a man who is a pervert.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,417
Say for example himself Freud was a perverted man

191
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,999
He had relations with his mother, so first he must

192
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,583
have met somebody, I give him all the chance you see

193
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,083
maybe he is born like that I don't know

194
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,208
but he must have met someone whose

195
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:24,083
mother must have had bad relation or something like that

196
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,375
and he must have treated this fellow.

197
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,834
By treating him he must have got that upon himself.

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,250
Now he made it a universal truth

199
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,417
for everyone that everybody has this within them.

200
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,834
It's absolutely wrong it's an absolutely wrong step. I mean in India

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,375
if you tell anybody they laugh they say God,

202
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,834
we have nothing to do. There was a gentleman, Freud fellow,

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
he came and started criticizing so he wrote an article

204
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,083
and people wrote him back answer saying that

205
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,000
“now you the Freudian you go back to England you are not wanted”.

206
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,375
He's an Indian but they said: “We don't want you here.”

207
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,834
We understand all these things better because traditionally

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,999
Indian mind has understood so many things.

209
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,834
And this trial and error method that

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,375
we know that this is all nonsense people are talking about

211
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:13,834
but because you people are naïve and great seekers.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,834
Moreover there is also ego problem

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,083
I have to balance it somehow and that's why

214
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,250
today because I told Dr. Warren

215
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,834
that I had told you that I don't want to tell these people and

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,291
you and the people who telephoned to Me

217
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,834
after called to Me that “Mother should be clear” and we did it

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,500
and there is an opposition so now you pay for it

219
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,625
and that's why he wanted to make an apology for everything.

220
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:39,709
There's nothing to be apologetic.

221
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:44,625
It is for you to receive it.  The position is very different.

222
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:50,291
It is you who have to ask for it. It's my

223
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,208
no gain for Me, I have nothing to gain. I have to give you something.

224
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,583
and when I have to give you something then you have to get it

225
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:03,834
yourself and not to doubt another. What will you get by doubting?

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,417
What are you going to get out of it

227
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,999
So first of all to put down your mind in proper shape

228
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,834
because it was too much of a shock yesterday to many people.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,834
There are people who said that all right today get Warren

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,875
talk about these things and pacify them, you see,

231
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,542
it's like pacifying a son-in-law who is angry.

232
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,041
All right, so this has worked out. I hope you people understand

233
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:34,542
that there is no need to feel disturbed.

234
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,250
we have to get our realization on the contrary if you do not get it

235
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:43,792
you must worry about it, that's not a good thing.

236
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,917
You must all get your realization.

237
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,667
Now this is the seventh chakra we were talking about.

238
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,959
Seventh chakra is the chakra where the limbic area in the brain

239
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,291
you see the limbic area is there. This limbic area is covered

240
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,458
with all the seven chakras. For example if you start from here

241
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,458
from the back where the protrusion is there

242
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:12,417
is the Mooladhara chakra which is down here.

243
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:18,375
So when you people have problems with sex.

244
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:23,750
Say, a person who has led a perverted sex life.

245
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,917
Gradually, this chakra gets influenced

246
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:33,125
and a person becomes mentally soft as you can say.

247
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:37,375
He starts getting you see hallucinations and

248
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:41,166
sometimes he loses his balance also,

249
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,166
The scent. Because the effect is on the brain.

250
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,083
So I'm just trying to explain to you these seven chakras

251
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:52,792
around the limbic area which is the Sahasrara, the last chakra

252
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:58,834
and how it affects. So now the second chakra is Swadisthana

253
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,083
which is round that Mooladhara here at the back.

254
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:08,834
Now Swadisthana is the chakra which as he said

255
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,834
on the gross looks after your liver, kidney

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,834
spleen, pancreas and your uterus

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,583
on the gross, on the physical level. Also is responsible

258
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:30,041
for giving you more creativity

259
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,959
future thinking

260
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,709
and also can be damaged if you overdo that

261
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,000
or if you try to take to something

262
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,834
that is unauthorized as God is concerned.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,917
So it affects both ways.

264
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,458
Now when this happens what are the problems, let's say.

265
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,208
First problem comes in that when you

266
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,834
the central portion is out of gear

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,458
this center shows results on the brain here.

268
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:06,375
and the effect on the brain is that. For supposing you are suffering

269
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,000
from diabetes take one example of diabetes,

270
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,375
your eyes will be affected.

271
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,875
You have seen diabetic people go on losing their eyesight gradually.

272
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,834
And they become big because it is on the optic lobe

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,417
sitting here and controls the optic lobe

274
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:29,083
so when you get diabetic that oppression of this centre

275
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:33,834
or you can say the

276
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:40,166
lethargy of this center makes your eyes weep gradually

277
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,792
because there is something wrong in the void

278
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:48,041
something wrong with the  Swadishtana chakra,

279
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,208
I will tell you shortly, because seven chakras we have today.

280
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,500
So now the higher chakra than that is the Nabhi chakra.

281
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,917
Nabhi chakra is left and right on your head here at the back, here.

282
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:08,083
Now this is the centre of, as he said, of your seeking.

283
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:13,041
and you are seeking money

284
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:18,291
or you are seeking power or you are seeking love,

285
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:23,250
all these things get indicated in this part of your head

286
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,625
and that's how the Nabhi chakra gets caught.

287
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,917
Now you can see when the kundalini rises

288
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:35,208
also in the brain you can find out what chakra is catching because

289
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,834
that is the portion if you put your hand you'll find is still very hot

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,083
the chakras which are all right

291
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:49,375
that portion in this line where all the centers are placed is soft

292
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:53,208
but where the chakras are wrong you can see it there.

293
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:56,250
Now this is tallied also that you feel

294
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,333
on the left hand this is the Nabhi chakra's finger or the right hand

295
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:03,834
some sort of a sensation of burning, maybe numbness or whatever it is

296
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,375
to show that these chakras are out.

297
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,500
Also you can see that the kundalini is rising

298
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,959
that the kundalini has stopped there and

299
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,125
she is moving here and there and you see the pulsation like that.

300
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,291
So it's all tallied you can see for yourself clearly.

301
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:23,917
So this is the Nabhi chakra which is very important

302
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:29,000
because it is your seeking, so it has to be put in balance

303
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,250
after that comes the higher chakra called the heart.

304
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,792
Is a very important chakra because

305
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,834
this chakra is placed in the center here

306
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,583
this is actually is the fontanel bone area just in the center, here.

307
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,834
Now the pulsation of the kundalini

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,709
is felt here first when she has not pierced through.

309
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:56,500
but when she pierces then you start feeling actually

310
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,834
the cool breeze coming out of that portion

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,250
but in the beginning maybe due to the

312
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,834
little friction between the kundalini and

313
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,834
this portion of the head maybe you might feel hot

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,792
or because of other things also inside the chakras.

315
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,208
But gradually kundalini corrects you and you find the cool breeze

316
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:18,834
coming out of your head so this is a very important chakra is heart

317
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,792
now this heart chakra is so made you'll be amazed,

318
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,166
that heart is the one which has the Spirit,

319
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,667
also it has the center heart

320
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:34,625
which is the Mother's, so this chakra is the most important chakra

321
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:38,834
in the last happening of the kundalini and unless and until this

322
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,834
breaks through it won't work out

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,834
so motherhood is important, motherhood in your temperament

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,333
and motherhood as a blessing to you,

325
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,792
all these things play a big part.

326
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,875
now that's why motherhood is very important

327
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,834
that you have to respect motherhood

328
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,500
Freud gave just the opposite of incentive

329
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:04,208
I mean this is anti-God activity

330
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,542
because the kundalini won't come up

331
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,834
if you have no respect for motherhood

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,500
maybe your mother may be a bad woman, all right, but

333
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,750
in general you must have respect for motherhood

334
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,375
or if you are a mother or if you are a woman

335
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,667
you must have respect for yourself as a mother.

336
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,917
The men should also have respect for mother.

337
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,583
Motherhood is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga,

338
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,083
where you find that the heart chakra

339
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:34,792
is this called as the Brahmarandra. Randra means the hole

340
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:37,667
and the Brahma is the divine power that is spread out.

341
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,542
So this is the hole which has to be broken

342
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,709
or is to be pierced through

343
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:47,458
and this is what is the actualization of baptism.

344
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:51,792
This is what is the real baptism. It is not just artificial

345
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,834
that anybody can put hand on your head

346
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,834
and say: "All right now you are a christian" or "You are a muslim"

347
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,667
or "You are a jew". It is not so, this has to actualize within you.

348
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,000
Now this happens when it comes up through this one.

349
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:13,834
In front of that here, if you find, is a part of the

350
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,291
Nabhi chakra a little bit here, you can feel it sometimes.

351
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:22,500
But here actually is the Vishuddhi chakra, if you see. This is

352
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
the Vishuddhi chakra means at this point your throat is controlled.

353
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,834
But it is the center where this Vishuddhi chakra Shri Krishna

354
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,709
becomes the primordial Being, the Akbar.

355
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:42,333
So when you are not one with the whole,

356
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:47,458
when you are detached from the whole, this becomes very problematic.

357
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,083
Now I have to tell you something about cancer,

358
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,375
because it is threatening the world today.

359
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,917
Is very simple can be cured, a little bit I will have to tell you

360
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,417
about cancer how it develops in a person,

361
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,208
whether he may be a good man or a bad man is not the point.

362
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:08,041
As it is cancer is built up every moment and is broken up

363
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,125
because when the sympathetic nervous system which

364
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,917
is looked after by these two powers within us

365
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,750
goes into overactivity,

366
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:19,583
like the left and the right, the movement is so strong

367
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:22,542
that it breaks the chakra,

368
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,667
and the chakra moves apart.

369
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:28,959
And the relationship with the whole, which is here

370
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,875
in the hole, with the Medulla oblongata gets disconnected.

371
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,000
Then anything on the left or the right,

372
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,208
it is triggered by something, which I have told you before.

373
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:43,333
This triggering when it takes place, it really gets seperated

374
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:48,834
and the cells starts growing on their own, they become malignant.

375
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,041
means they are separated from the whole.

376
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,458
Any man who behaves like that,

377
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,208
who is broken from the whole, doesn't understand of the whole

378
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,333
is a malignant person.

379
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:04,291
So the malignant cell starts growing in such a way that that cell

380
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,750
whenever it touches another cell, that also becomes malignant.

381
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,875
You may develop a nose very big or

382
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,834
ears very big or a tongue very big

383
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,792
not related to the general growth of your body,

384
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,792
so the controlling point of the whole is lost.

385
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,792
Now this is come when it starts, you see this [thing] really

386
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,333
becomes a very big obstacle here the Vishuddhi chakra.

387
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,959
Is very important, but when it starts developing here the whole

388
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:38,083
what you call the pressure comes up here.

389
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:44,583
which starts spreading on the sides, moreover to add to the problem

390
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:49,041
if you have been to wrong gurus, and wrong people

391
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,875
your void gets caught up.

392
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,792
The ten centers, these are the ten centers here.

393
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:59,000
So we have eleven centers and these are the destroying forces of

394
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:04,542
Shri Kalki means our Lord Jesus Christ when he's going to come again

395
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,208
on the white horse, is this one and this is called as sambha.

396
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:14,542
At the equal level of the head and here there are eleven forces

397
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,291
which are the destructive forces which come into play.

398
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:22,208
Sometimes this side is more or sometimes this side is more,

399
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:26,083
but when it starts working out they start destroying you

400
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,291
and you may get any disease

401
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,917
which is really destructive gradually to you. It can work out as any

402
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:38,834
incurable diseases, any disease that eats you off, all those things

403
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,834
will start and this portion of the head is a very important one.

404
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,583
You are not supposed to bend this before anyone.

405
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:51,458
You should not bend this before anyone, but

406
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:54,999
when you have found out the right person, you can do it.

407
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,834
Before realization, I do not allow anybody to touch my feet

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,834
at any cost but if they are realized and approved

409
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,542
as people who have started their vibrations cool,

410
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,291
then only they are allowed to touch my foot.

411
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,250
That has to be very discretely seen because

412
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,291
maybe the force is so much there that you might faint.

413
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,667
So one has to be careful as to see if you can bear it.

414
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,542
So I was saying it is the other way round thing that works out.

415
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:28,959
Now what Sahaja Yoga does is that it's the power that is flowing

416
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,834
through these Sahaja yogis who are here.

417
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:36,792
And even my photograph has the power. If it has it has.

418
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,041
This can be used

419
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,834
for giving vibrations to that part which is suffering.

420
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,542
or that center which is not all right.

421
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,875
People don't talk in the language as the doctors do,

422
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:54,542
they just say what center is out. If they say ekadesha is forming

423
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,999
that means there's a possibility of it turning into a cancer.

424
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,375
Because cancer as I told you is built in all the time with

425
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,291
overactivity and again neutralised by parasympathetic nervous system

426
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:08,959
But the cancer that is going to settle down

427
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,667
is indicated here and you start feeling the throbbing  over here

428
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,000
of the parashakti as it is called but not necessarily, it can be

429
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,834
the other way around also and it is one of the symptoms, I would say

430
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,542
But can be that if you feel here that kind of a

431
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:29,041
heaviness or that kind of a pulsation here not necessarily

432
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,291
that you are going for a cancer but

433
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,375
it's one of the symptoms one can feel.

434
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:37,917
But the best way is not to talk about the diseases,

435
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,875
but better to talk about thesubtle thing which are the chakras.

436
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,583
If your chakras are in perfect state,

437
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,250
if you can correct your chakras properly,

438
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:50,000
then you will have no problem of any kind.

439
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,999
So now we are here up to Vishuddhi chakra,

440
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,417
and this is the Agnya chakra

441
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:58,458
about which I have told you yesterday.

442
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:01,458
So we have all the seven chakras in the brain.

443
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:06,458
Now the kundalini is brought up through this Agnya chakra

444
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:09,959
and enters into this limbic area which is the kingdom of God.

445
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,667
But here all these seven chakras get related to each other,

446
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,166
because these are the seats of the chakras

447
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,792
and that's how the integration start taking place.

448
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,917
When little bit of integration is worked up,

449
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,625
this opens out and the Kundalini passes out.

450
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:29,500
This is what is the real knowledge, but people are so much enamored

451
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:34,041
by their ego, by their own ideas that anybody who says all right

452
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,208
you wear this dress you become a yogi,

453
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,417
you take this name you become a yogi,

454
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,917
like this falsehood with which they live,

455
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:44,709
you should not live with falsehood, because

456
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:48,792
falsehood is not the way, life is. Life is reality.

457
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,750
And it is such a beautiful thing to know the reality,

458
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:54,792
because reality is nothing but glory and beauty.

459
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,166
One should not be convinced if somebody says

460
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,792
all right you take this name. Your name is swami such and such.

461
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:04,875
or they say you are a Falana and [Makada].

462
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,417
This is not to be believed in because you are deceiving yourself.

463
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,333
There is no need to change your name.

464
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,291
Nothing is needed, the change comes within.

465
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,166
You should not be satisfied with this changing of the dress.

466
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,667
Supposing you wear a [dai... ] coat or you wear an ordinary coat

467
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,875
makes no difference inside, does it?

468
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,625
In the same way, if you color your clothes

469
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,417
and go 'round saying that: "I'm such a yogi" and all that

470
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,625
Remember that this is misleading

471
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,500
Don't take to these things. You should not mislead yourself.

472
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:37,208
You must face yourself up to. Now if you take drugs also,

473
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:40,375
in the same way it harms you very much in your awareness

474
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,583
and your brain and you find that there is a problem

475
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,333
on the right hand backwards. Most of the [ ]

476
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:48,834
also give you on the right hand side a problem

477
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,750
Because here the superego touches on the right head

478
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,166
Now those people who are extremely aggressive

479
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,542
and have taken to aggressive methods and all that,

480
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,041
this left side gets caught up.

481
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,709
Now you must see the nature has built within us

482
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:06,875
a beautiful balancing phenomenon.

483
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,709
Supposing you are a person who is very hard working.

484
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,000
You work very hard, you go for the future and

485
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,834
you do all kinds of things with your mind and all the time you are

486
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,625
planning and this and that, the right side you are working on.

487
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:21,166
Actually, you are working through your brain and your brain must go out.

488
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:24,667
But no all such people even till the end they go to their grave

489
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:27,875
they are very alert in the brains. Nothing goes wrong with the brain

490
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,542
but the heart.

491
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,834
Heart is the one that is caught up. You'll be surprised that never

492
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,959
a person who is mad gets a heart attack.

493
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:43,834
Because he's on the superego. Now, he's using his left side.

494
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:48,458
She should get his heart, but he gets its brain out.

495
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Just imagine the balancing forces that are working in you.

496
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,709
Actually when you get your first attack

497
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:58,041
remember that you are overdoing it, stop it at that moment.

498
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,583
It's a indication coming to you from nature.

499
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:04,709
But we know we have an operation and again go like big horse.

500
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,834
There's no need. But another thing

501
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,625
is that in Sahaja Yoga you really settle down in the center.

502
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,959
You don't have this problems of going to extremes

503
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,291
or getting to extreme behaviors.

504
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,458
And you get to a point where you really realize

505
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:27,875
that you are the Spirit and you are the absolute being.

506
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,083
It's not any ego and superego

507
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:33,333
because then you don't say that I did this.

508
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:38,417
Like supposing there's a lady who came with me to America

509
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,125
and she called herself [a moanor] and she said:

510
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,917
"Mother, You must give him realization." I said: "I'm trying".

511
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,625
So breaking my hands on the working morning till evening

512
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:49,583
I'm trying but what to do I can't do it now.

513
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,500
I said: "All right you are a realized soul, you give a certificate."

514
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,875
She said: "How can I give a false certificate?"

515
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:58,583
"Because it is not there." You start speaking in the third way.

516
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,000
You say: "It is not there." "It is not coming."

517
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,834
"It is not working." You don't say: "I'm not working it out."

518
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,458
You don't say that "I'm not doing it" or "I am doing it."

519
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,583
What you say that "I'm trying

520
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:13,834
but it doesn't come"; it, you start talking in a third way

521
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,834
and that is what happens to you, you lose your ego. In Sahaja Yoga

522
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,458
also we have seen some people who come to Sahaja Yoga

523
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,667
get into ego trips, because it's a habit.

524
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:28,834
It's a very bad habit in the West, you get into ego trips, you see.

525
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,375
They jump into some imaginary balloons, I don't know what.

526
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,583
And they start thinking: "I'm this, I'm that".

527
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:37,166
I'm quite frightened to see this fellow was quite a normal person

528
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,750
till yesterday. Now what has happened.

529
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:43,667
So you see this ego is such a thing that if one egoistical person

530
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,375
comes in another can take up from that person.

531
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:50,583
It's such a horrible stuff is very contagious.

532
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:53,500
and that's how you will find that one egoistical nowadays

533
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:56,333
the husband shout the wife will shout. And the wife shouts

534
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:59,458
and the husband breaks. If supposing one person just stops

535
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,125
not shouting, it will calm down, definitely.

536
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,458
But the contagious disease goes on

537
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,375
including that the children become shouters, it goes on like that.

538
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,875
So the ego is a thing that one does not feel it,

539
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,875
does not understand it and it goes on destroying you, all the time.

540
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:20,291
And the ego gives you a self-importance, but not self-esteem.

541
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,333
It just gives you self importance and weight

542
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,709
but what have you achieved? So to be the Spirit

543
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:31,542
you become humble yourself. You become absolutely humble.

544
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,667
One gentleman once told me

545
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:38,875
that I've heard you are doing such great things.

546
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,291
And I've known you for 25 years I did not know that you are

547
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,333
Mataji Nirmala Devi, I only knew you as Mrs. Shrivastava wife of

548
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:49,625
such and such and he was the

549
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:54,417
high court, Hague high court's, German he is.

550
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:58,834
So I said all right, he said no you are coming tomorrow to my house.

551
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,375
You have to give me realization. I never knew. So I said

552
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,834
"How did you come to know?" They said we have a,

553
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,041
he is from royal family, another maharadja who had your photograph

554
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,625
in his pocket and he took it out and put it to his head so I said:

555
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:13,834
"What's the matter". He said you see I had a very bad heart trouble

556
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,625
and Mataji cured me, so he simply took the photograph

557
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:18,834
and he said Oh God this is Mrs. Shrivastava

558
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,166
I knew her for 25 years, I never knew she could even speak.

559
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:26,375
So oh she speaks and not only she speaks to all them

560
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:28,834
He said we can't believe it this woman could speak.

561
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,667
Because what I known her for this thing she's a very quiet person.

562
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,041
So for all practical purposes I'm a very quiet person.

563
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:40,166
And then he came and he got his realization

564
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,834
and he's such a humble man, you won't believe he's such a humble man.

565
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,083
He said I found it, it's a very learned personality.

566
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,250
There is so many like that, we have an ambassador

567
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:55,291
of Spain who was another humble man you see and he came to me

568
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,000
and he said Mother give me realization I've come to know about it.

569
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,458
Of course on that level I don't talk to people.

570
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,834
He got his realization and if I'm sitting, say, on a chair

571
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,667
he will not sit, he will sit on the ground

572
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,917
the governor of Kashmir, I tell you.

573
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,375
This is a very different style thing in India

574
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,834
is I must tell you we people are very different.

575
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,417
even a garbage cleaner becomes such a big

576
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:20,166
governor here that it's impossible to talk, it's a very funny thing.

577
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:23,834
I'll tell you a story once a garbage cleaner came to our house you see

578
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
and I said all right this is an extra garbage you throw it away

579
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,458
So he said all right I'm willing to throw it away

580
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,166
the garbage, but how much are you going to pay me?

581
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,999
I said all right I'll give you some 10 pounds or something.

582
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,834
He said you Indians you don't know any laws, rules, regulations

583
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,834
and started shouting at me. And this gentleman of the

584
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,250
Hague high court the chairman of Hague high court, the judge was

585
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,625
standing there he came out he said why are you talking so loudly

586
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,625
to her, this is not the way to talk to a lady.

587
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,625
He said: "What do you know about laws?" He's the one who's in charge.

588
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:58,875
"Oh you Indians, I know how terrible you are,

589
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:00,999
you have no idea of laws". You see he was the one

590
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,750
who was taking [br...] from me actually

591
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,917
and he was telling off this fellow like this. There is no humility,

592
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,834
there's no respect. A garbage cleaner talking

593
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:13,834
like to the head of an organization which is dealing with

594
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,417
law, who has written so many books on human laws.

595
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:20,083
There is no sense of proportion out here

596
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,834
that, what are we? Why should we be so boastful, arrogant

597
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,834
and rude it's not good it's not human it's like animals behaving

598
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,583
it's not a good thing, we have to be gentle,

599
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,834
absolutely gentle, because we are human.

600
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,917
God has given us so much, what blessings God has given us.

601
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,999
I find Australians [tend] very much better than any other western

602
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:44,333
people I must tell you whatever people may say about you.

603
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,667
That's my experiencing and I always tell everybody

604
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,709
you have to learn a lot from them because they are innocent.

605
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,875
They're simple, they're innocent and all the time they want to know

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,458
what's wrong with them. They are simple people.

607
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,875
They want to know about it.

608
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:59,667
But I'm just telling you be careful of all these mister ego.

609
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:03,834
He's a horrible stuff, it always comes up for nothing at all,

610
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,667
and is of no use it's an empty vessel that makes too much noise.

611
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:12,375
So now today, we are going to again have the session of realization

612
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,417
and this is the seven chakras on the limbic area.

613
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,458
When you get the realization, all these chakras

614
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:23,834
get completely enlightened within you as you progress.

615
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,417
And all your centers get absolutely enlightened.

616
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,375
And you get all these different deities awakened within you.

617
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:35,667
Then the power that, you see, you receive first

618
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,834
is that you receive complete bliss and joy.

619
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,542
Of course in the west, people feel joy the last I will say.

620
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:47,417
But mentally they understand, they become very equipped mentally.

621
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,750
Dr. Warren who is sitting before you he was the same.

622
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,834
I've seen it all of them first they become mentally very equipped.

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,291
They know so much because the whole knowledge comes into their head

624
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:59,417
first but their brains are more developed.

625
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:03,166
While the people who have heart more developed they first feel the joy.

626
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,125
You know the Fiji people who were here yesterday, day before,

627
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,792
I said: "How are you feeling?". They are feeling the joy

628
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,834
"ananda rama" that is the joy coming up because their hearts

629
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,792
are open, so that is what happens to people

630
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:18,542
who are too much mentally involved this is what happens to them

631
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,500
and those who are involved in the heart

632
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,333
they start feeling the joy, doesn't matter.

633
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,583
But the growth takes place, a transformation takes place.

634
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:30,625
Overnight people have given up their drugs,

635
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:34,667
their diseases, so many things have happened. But you must know

636
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:39,583
that truth can be little shattering to your preconceived ideas.

637
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,375
But God can not remain with you as he wanted to.

638
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:48,834
He is what He is, He will be what He has to be.

639
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,333
you cannot command God that You stay

640
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,834
like this now I'm going to organize you.

641
00:37:54,917 --> 00:37:59,959
He is organized everything for us, we cannot organize for Him.

642
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:04,375
He works the way He works, every time, every minute

643
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:10,709
for Him is all perfect and for you also it will be because

644
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,333
you will be living in the present.

645
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:18,041
When you start living in the present, every moment is dynamic.

646
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:22,917
You really become a dynamic person, not a cabbage, not a madman

647
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:28,041
but a dynamic wonderful person, who's rid of all his problems.

648
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,375
Dr. Warren himself had blood pressure,

649
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,125
I don't know all sorts of problems he had and it's all got corrected.

650
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,458
But there are so many who are sitting here at this,

651
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,834
there are 30, 40 people who will tell that,

652
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,667
how they got cured of there problems. So

653
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,834
you all should think that here is somebody

654
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,583
who is just here for your benefit

655
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,458
and there's nothing to worry, that's all he was trying to tell you.

656
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,166
and I have to tell you the same.

657
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,709
But this Sahasrara has to open out

658
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,166
in a way if you start doubting Me Sahasrara doesn't open,

659
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,834
because I'm there. I must tell you I'm in the Sahasrara.

660
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,208
That's the way, I am there.

661
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,583
You can find out later on when you find pressures

662
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,542
on you head, you have to take my name, otherwise, doesn't open up.

663
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,250
What can I do about it, I am there.

664
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,792
So you have to just not accept me or surrender.

665
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,999
What are you going to surrender except for ego what do you have?

666
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,834
So there's nothing to be surrendered, nothing to be

667
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,291
given to me nothing, just you have to take more, become deeper

668
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:33,291
and deeper and deeper and a personality who is [envished].

669
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
But in Sahaja Yoga there are no courses,

670
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,667
nothing of the kind, you have to work it out.

671
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,542
Come to the center, it's a collective happening,

672
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,458
it's not a single person sitting at home.

673
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,667
You all have to come,

674
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,458
make your progress, progress further and further.

675
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,333
You'll be looked after very well with love

676
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,291
and you will see how people are transforming.

677
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,792
How gentle they are, how nice they are, how kind they are.

678
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,792
Maybe one of them may turn out to be egoistical,

679
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,999
so you just treat him as a madman, can be.

680
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:05,291
You see, who is used to this thing they go mad, for again circle.

681
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,667
and again they come back, but doesn't matter.

682
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,917
So I have to request you that you must come on a Sunday

683
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:14,166
where I would like to meet you all and today let us see how many

684
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,125
of you feel the cool breeze.

685
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,834
Now I would request you to take out your shoes and sit

686
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
in a way that you are touching the Mother earth with both the feet.

687
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,959
Sahaja Yoga is only meant for true seekers, not for people who

688
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:49,375
are false people or who want to satisfy themselves with falsehood.

689
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,000
You have to ask for truth and if you ask for truth, you'll get it.

690
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:08,834
Now the first thing as I told you before, you have to understand

691
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,583
that you should not feel guilty, that is very important.

692
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,125
Now somebody started arguing with Me,

693
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,583
that God has told me to feel guilty.

694
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:21,417
Now I don't know which God has told you.

695
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,333
All these ideas you you give up.

696
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,834
Please do not feel guilty at all, because I'm saying that God is

697
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,834
forgiveness, God is love, He's anxious to give you realisation.

698
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,458
He's extremely anxious that you should get it,

699
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,834
the time has some, this is the Last Judgement.

700
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,583
You see the resurrection time, you have toget it, there's no

701
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,834
other way out for Him also because He has to save His creation

702
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,250
and His creation are human beings, so

703
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,834
please for Heaven's sake do not feel guilty.

704
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,750
This is a very important time.

705
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:58,834
If you are feeling guilty, you just tell yourself that

706
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,750
Mother I'm not guilty, that is the first condition,

707
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:04,709
that you should not feel guilty at all at this time.

708
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,500
All right, then the second condition is that

709
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,792
you close your eyes and put your hands towards Me.

710
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,834
So that you understand that

711
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,125
there is no mesmerism, for what I should mesmerize you, very sorry.

712
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,458
But you see, you have to close your eyes and please

713
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,834
don't open your eyes,  because when the Agnya chakra

714
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,834
when your eyes are open, Agnya chakra

715
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,750
doesn't allow the kundalini to pass through,

716
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,750
So please do not open your eyes till I tell you.

717
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:38,709
Because as I told you there is no mesmerism, nothing

718
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,250
it works like sunshine, so just pur your hands

719
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,333
towards Me like this, on your lap, very comfortably.

720
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,458
Very comfortably be seated,

721
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,834
extremely comfortably you all should sit down.

722
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,959
Put both the hands with your fingers little bit stretched

723
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,166
and close your eyes.

724
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,959
You can remove your spectacles will help you or any

725
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,208
[malas] or anything you are wearing in your neck

726
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:06,291
which is heavy, if there's something heavy,

727
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,375
please take it out, also one has to be

728
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:14,834
a little bit loose in the waist, if it's very tight

729
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:18,834
something on the waist maybe not good, so something

730
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,625
or in the neck, necktie or something, should be also loosened.

731
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,333
Please put your hands towards me.

732
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,250
Please take out your spectacles please,

733
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:40,333
because it affects your eyesight also,

734
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:43,083
it might improve your eyesight.

735
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:49,917
Both the hands towards me, like this, on your lap.

736
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,250
Now, as I told you the left hand is the desire

737
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,792
so keep the left hand as it is.

738
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,999
but as I tell you you have to move the right hand.

739
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:17,417
Just don't open your eyes, that is very important.

740
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,375
You must sit still and don't do any movements.

741
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:28,999
Just keep it still, you need not bend your head

742
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,583
or push it back, make it straight, that's all.

743
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:33,834
But no pressure on your neck.

744
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,500
Sit in a way that is comfortable to begin with.

745
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:46,792
Now we have to put our right hand on the heart.

746
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:53,834
Just on the heart and to say: "Mother,

747
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,333
I am the Spirit", with all confidence. Say it thrice.

748
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:03,959
Because you are, you are the Spirit, no doubt

749
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,500
and that Spirit has to manifest

750
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:08,834
to show you what glorious thing you are.

751
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,792
You're not your ego, you're not your mind, you're not your body,

752
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,834
but you are the Spirit, the reflection of God almighty within you.

753
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,083
So say it on your heart.

754
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,792
Steady down, steady.

755
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:33,375
Put your left hand towards me, yes.

756
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,208
Steady down, steady, you must steady yourselves.

757
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:44,417
Now put down this right hand on the stomach,

758
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:48,834
on the left hand side. And with full confidence you have to say

759
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,542
- to awaken your principle of primordial master within you -

760
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:59,792
to say Mother I a my own master, I'm my own guru, I'm my own guide

761
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:02,875
ten times.

762
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,750
Because, if you are the Spirit

763
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:08,834
then the Spirit guides you through vibratory awareness.

764
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,834
And once you said I'm the Spirit you have t0 accept all the aspects

765
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,834
of Spirit by saying that the Spirit is my guide and I'm the Spirit.

766
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,542
Please say it ten times.

767
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,709
Now put your attention

768
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:48,834
there where you've put your hand and say that "Mother

769
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,834
I am the master, I am the guru, I am my own guide".

770
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,083
This is to awaken within you, say it with confidence, please

771
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,959
Now

772
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,208
put your left hand towards me

773
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:13,041
and right hand towards the stomach I said on the stomach.

774
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,375
Press it with your fingers on the left side.

775
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:22,750
Now if you have said it ten times

776
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:26,583
you put the hand again on your heart,

777
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,625
again go back to the same point, that you are the Spirit.

778
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,709
That's the second point, so you have to say:

779
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,917
"Mother, I'm the Spirit", but twelve times.

780
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:40,083
Because this center has got twelve subplexuses.

781
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,125
This is very good for all the people who have heart attacks,

782
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,792
heart troubles, heart problems, it's very good for them.

783
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:54,083
This is the mantra.

784
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:13,417
Now raise your right hand on the Vishuddhi chakra,

785
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:18,208
left side of your neck, that's the Vishuddhi.

786
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:22,125
Left hand side of your neck.

787
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:26,250
This is the center which goes out of gear in many people

788
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,000
because they feel guilty, it's very simple.

789
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,834
So you have to say: "Mother I'm not guilty",

790
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,667
for anything whatsoever. Don't think of your guilt, of the past.

791
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:58,375
Forget it beause you are going to be transformed.

792
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:02,875
As I told you yesterday an egg has to become a bird.

793
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:06,083
Then the start matter, the egg, whatever specks it has

794
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:09,291
is finished once the shell is out.

795
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:13,291
So just say sixteen times:

796
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,208
"Mother I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty".

797
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,083
Now you are entering into the temple of God and

798
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,166
a guilty person cannot enter,

799
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:38,417
because you are the Spirit, how can you be guilty?

800
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:42,333
You cannot be guilty because you are the Spirit.

801
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,542
Come back to the same point. Because you are the Spirit

802
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:48,041
you cannot enter

803
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,625
into the idea of guilt.

804
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:57,250
Spirit is never attached to any such ideas.

805
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,834
Now put the right hand on your forehead.

806
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,333
Across. At this point you have to say:

807
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:17,458
"Mother, I forgive everyone", you have to forgive everyone.

808
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,959
Please forgive everyone,

809
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:26,125
because the Spirit is the forgiving force within us.

810
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:31,125
Christ forgave people who crucified him.

811
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:36,500
And not only that, but he asked God, His Father

812
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:39,834
to forgive them, for they did not know what they where doing.

813
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:45,834
In his name you have to forgive everyone. Just forgive everyone.

814
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:53,083
It's very easy to say that and you just say it and it works out.

815
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:59,166
It's amazingly powerful.

816
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,959
Now put this hand steadily on your head.

817
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,875
On top of your head, now you find it's rather heavy

818
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:14,000
in the center part. Try to press it with your palm a little bit.

819
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:19,291
At this time, you have to say: "Mother, give me realisation

820
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,625
because I cannot cross your [fate?]. You're free.

821
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:25,959
So you have to just say: "Mother, please give me my realisation"

822
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:30,959
at this point. Say it seven times, because there are seven centers.

823
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:50,834
Now just put you hand up at four inches

824
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:53,041
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

825
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:01,750
Now try with another hand, put right hand down and left hand you try

826
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:04,959
if there's a cool breeze coming in.

827
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,083
I think it has worked out.

828
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,208
You can put both the hands towards Me now.

829
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,792
It's like raising the mountains I tell you,

830
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:58,125
it's really like raising the mountains.

831
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,959
Now put your both the hands up in the sky, let's see.

832
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:05,750
Just like this, higher

833
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:09,834
and ask the question: "Mother is this

834
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,208
the breeze of the Holy Ghost?".

835
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,792
Just ask in your heart:

836
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:19,959
"Is this the cool wind of the Holy Ghost?"

837
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,959
"Is this the brahmashakti, is this the all-pervading power of God?"

838
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:26,999
Just ask the question

839
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,959
only these questions will give you answer as answer.

840
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:36,041
And now you can ask also: "Mother are you the Holy Ghost", let's see.

841
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,291
"Mother are you the Holy Ghost?", ask three times.

842
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,500
It is start working faster that question.

843
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:59,000
Felt it? Now put down your hands

844
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:03,333
and see for yourself, slowly open your eyes.

845
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:07,792
See if it works in your hand a kind of a sensation flowing in.

846
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:24,291
Now we'll [still] show you also how to protect yourself

847
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,583
because once you are realised, you're like a absolutely a newly born

848
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:33,834
or newly awakened seed.

849
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,834
So you are to be protected and how to protect yourself, nicely

850
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,458
and how to give kundalini awakening, both things

851
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:46,083
Dr Warren will show you, how to raise your

852
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:49,375
kundalini yourself and how to protect yourself

853
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,250
when you want and I hope you will make it

854
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:59,000
convenient all of you to come and see Me on Sunday, thank you.

855
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:05,959
Dr Warren: "Just put the left hand at the level of the kundalini

856
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:09,709
and the right hand above and at the front

857
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:14,500
take it down, back and up, this is the manner of turning

858
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:19,000
so lift it, putting your attention to the kundalini.

859
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:23,917
Take it right up, give it a twist

860
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:28,375
and knot it once, and bring your hands down.

861
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Again we raise it hands down at the kundalini, turn it.

862
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:39,333
Up, and raise it

863
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:44,291
above the head and twist it, and knot it

864
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,834
once, and this time three times for the three channels."

865
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,834
Three gunas. Dr Warren: "three knots".

866
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,792
Three powers. Dr Warren: "Whirl it and knot it once

867
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:04,417
turn it and knot it twice

868
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:09,375
turn it and knot it three times and just bring your hands down

869
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:13,834
and put them towards Mother, open your fingers out

870
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,834
and see if you're feeling." Now ask them to give bandhan.

871
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,542
Dr Warren: "Now the second aspect, as Mother said

872
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,834
is to protect yourself.

873
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,834
We do this by what is called a bandhan, it's like an umbrella

874
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,375
we are putting over ourselves." Your aura is to be protected.

875
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,834
Dr. Warren: "Put our left hand towards Mother and our right hand

876
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,834
over the side at the lowest chakra and we come over the top

877
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,542
and down once, back twice

878
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:53,834
seven times, again over, three times

879
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,834
back over, four times, back over five times

880
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,834
six times, six and seven

881
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,834
put your hands back out. You protected yourself

882
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,083
by a bandhan, which simply means a bond of love."

883
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:18,834
There is another thing one has to know, that

884
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,125
when this is a power of love showing through your hand now

885
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:27,417
it's a power of love, you have to study it of course, you have to know

886
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:30,917
what it is, how it works, how you have to give realisation.

887
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:34,875
Now you can give realisation to people, you can show people

888
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:38,792
all these powers you've got now, but first you must tell yourself,

889
00:57:38,999 --> 00:57:42,041
steadiness is very important in Sahaja Yoga to begin with

890
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:48,834
and then you will be amazed that if you are standing somewhere

891
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,875
you tell somebody, the person will feel healed.

892
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,417
It's tremendous thing because you're tremendous,

893
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,041
but you have to feel that within yourself.

894
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:01,250
You must practice it first of all and then test it

895
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,834
if you have got it or not, but not with doubts

896
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,875
but with confidence that you are now the saints.

897
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:11,041
You are the prophets as William Blake has said

898
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,291
that God of man, he's described these times, God of men

899
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,458
will become prophets and the prophets will

900
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:26,458
later on make others prophet and this is exactly what is happening.

901
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:28,834
another person is William Blake who

902
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:30,959
has completely described Sahaja Yoga.

903
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:34,625
So I would like to meet you personally when you come there

904
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:40,625
and I hope we'll be able to provide you with good lunch also.

905
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:45,959
It was very kind of you, all of you to come down and meet Me.

906
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,542
I've been very anxious to meet you all, may God bless you.

907
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:55,917
What's it? (It's OK) Who's talking?

908
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:59,583
Dr.: "For those people who don't know the address, I think it's

909
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:03,083
well implanted in your mind that 172

910
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,375
Albert Road, Stratfield, 10 o'clock on Sunday.3

911
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,667
and ask them to bring sat, sugar and oil.

912
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,834
Dr Warren: "As I told before Mother's requested you to bring

913
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,208
salt, about half a pound, something like that.

914
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:23,125
Salt and sugar and a small bottle of water, She'll vibrate it for you

915
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,959
have your own vibrated drinking water" and oil, olive oil

916
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,834
Dr. "and some oil, because you may need it for massage purposes

917
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,959
or otherwise for healing, so salt, sugar, about half a pound

918
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:38,792
a bottle of water and some oil, it can be olive oil

919
00:59:38,999 --> 00:59:43,999
it can be". White sugar, more of the sugar cane.

920
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:48,834
If they can get of the sugar cane?
