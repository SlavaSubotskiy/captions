1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:21,780
You see, it shows how William Blake thought
of you people; and he represents that hope

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:33,159
for England in this poem that I had about
you people.

3
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:47,090
As I had told you that: England is the heart;
and the heart has to be first of all established,

4
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,500
otherwise Sahaja Yoga is not going to be established.

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:03,889
Now the people who live in this country are
least believing, I think, in William Blake

6
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:08,640
as you all do.

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:21,859
(Inaudible) [This poem shows] Very clearly
what hopes William Blake had.

8
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:32,130
He could see the vision very clearly and he
said that England has to become the Jerusalem.

9
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,990
In Sanskrit language it’s called as teevtha.

10
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:54,130
Teevtha means a pilgrimage place, a place
where pilgrims come in.

11
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:02,409
And this indication here, of this poem, which
is so beautifully written by William Blake,

12
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:13,550
shows that he saw the vision of Sahaja Yoga
prospering in England in this beautiful manner.

13
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:29,340
But, as it is, this heart is so materially
bound.

14
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,300
There’s so much of materialism that has
come into our veins even.

15
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:44,140
And we have to realize that we have to get
it out of our mind, out of our body.

16
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:52,090
It has gone into us so much, the materialistic
approach towards life, that we have to really

17
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,260
take a strong action against it.

18
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:04,300
It’s so much that anybody who comes to this
country also becomes materialistic.

19
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,590
Imagine [the] heart becoming a matter.

20
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,990
Think of [the] heart becoming a stone.

21
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:25,190
And today on a day when you are here to worship
Me as a Guru.

22
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,870
My desire is only one and that is that you
all should become gurus yourself.

23
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:37,790
Now I have struggled for seven years here
to build you up and all the struggle that

24
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:47,460
is described has been done single-handed to
begin with and then so many of you joined.

25
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,620
But when you join Me you have to realize that
you have to really transform yourself.

26
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,590
You have to know that you are, first of all,
realized souls.

27
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,740
Which, also, very few people really realize
and are aware, I think, that they are realized

28
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,740
souls.

29
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:11,260
They are not the other, mundane, type of people,
ordinary people.

30
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,070
They are realized souls.

31
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:27,680
So as it is they have to get out off this
shell in which they have been living.

32
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,170
The ideas of securities, that you have had
so far, come to you all from materialism if

33
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,120
you study yourself correctly.

34
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,590
Everything is trickling down to you that is
materialism.

35
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,030
How many people read William Blake?

36
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:53,160
How many understand him and how many believe
in him?

37
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,120
And then how many follow him?

38
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:04,310
He is a lost poet of this country.

39
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:11,220
After getting realization, unless and until
the people of England understand that they

40
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:20,290
have to completely transform themselves into
a new awareness of understanding that: you

41
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:29,510
are now realized souls, you are part and parcel
of the whole and you are aware of it.

42
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,170
Firstly, materialism crawls into you in so
many ways.

43
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,190
Because there has been industrial revolution.

44
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,639
People have created many things.

45
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:50,030
Matter has been comforting you 
and you got used to matter.

46
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,060
You just can’t do without it.

47
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:04,010
A small thing say for example – you must
have a paper napkin, or you must have a glove.

48
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:09,210
This is the minimum of minimum.

49
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:22,900
But see, how many countries use these things?

50
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,380
How many people in the world use these things?

51
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,420
It is not needed for the body.

52
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:39,550
By this over preservation of yourself and
by this domination of matter upon yourself,

53
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:48,680
you have really become delicate darlings,
absolutely delicate darlings.

54
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Like if you go to Himalayas take it.

55
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,120
I went to Bhowali and other places like Nainita.

56
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:11,510
They are, all the time, colder than London,
and there are peaks which are, all the time,

57
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:22,180
covered with snow and the people there never
use shoes or socks, never.

58
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:29,080
They take their baths everyday with cold water,
every day!

59
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:39,190
You’ll be amazed every one of them, they
have rosy cheeks, they are not pale, they

60
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,870
are healthy people.

61
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,930
Their women folk carry all the wood, all the
way up the hill.

62
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:54,440
God has made your body in such a way that
it can bear up lots of things.

63
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:03,610
Of course now, suddenly, an Englishman cannot
become a Pahadi, means a man living on the

64
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,310
hills, that I understand.

65
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,860
You cannot suddenly become that.

66
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,389
But gradually try to give up certain things
that you think so important in life.

67
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,570
Try!

68
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,699
One day it may pain, second day it may pain.

69
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:26,020
Because unless and until you make really great
effort to get rid of materialistic body and

70
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,520
mind, you cannot be alright.

71
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:42,800
And this is the biggest stumbling block for
the western seekers.

72
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,319
You have to get out of that cocoon, as I said.

73
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:51,240
The whole transmutation has to take place.

74
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,279
Every time you ask anyone, he’s catching
still.

75
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:08,529
How can you become Gurus?

76
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:14,240
I mean your Guru can live in whatever conditions,
as I told you the other day.

77
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,230
Now there are some Indians here, ask them
if they can wash their hands in washbasins

78
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,689
with the water in it.

79
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,060
Ask any Indian.

80
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,450
They just can’t do it.

81
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,770
They can’t use paper only, they just can’t
live with the paper only.

82
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,170
They just can’t live like that.

83
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,170
Impossible.

84
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,959
I can’t think of one Indian who can do that.

85
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,700
Even in the poorest conditions in England
they cannot do it.

86
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,199
They might have lived here for twenty-five
years I can assure you, they just can’t

87
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:52,199
do it.

88
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,499
They can’t live without baths.

89
00:09:54,499 --> 00:10:00,550
You may tell them a hundred times that “you
take your bath once a week,” it’s impossible.

90
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,029
Two weeks is out of question, they will die.

91
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:11,790
Even if they have got lung cancer they will
take.

92
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,730
But you have seen Me, how much I can adjust.

93
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,190
Though all my life I’ve lived in India.

94
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,459
I can live under any circumstances, I can
live in Indian villages.

95
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,699
In any circumstances I can live.

96
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:36,970
So the other day also I told you, and again
I tell you, first of all get out you this

97
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,029
mala, this filth of materialism.

98
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,790
Indians also become materialistic when they
come to England.

99
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,019
For them money is important, nothing else.

100
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:56,410
They have no time for anything else but for
money.

101
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,209
It’s a fact.

102
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:05,410
Anybody who touches this land becomes money
possessed.

103
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:12,910
If you tell them that money’s not everything
they can’t understand, they go mad.

104
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,089
Morning till evening they are also running
in the rat race.

105
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,170
Now you have to change, you have to come out
of it.

106
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,010
You have to stand out and see for yourself
that you are no more one of these mad people

107
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,860
who run after matter.

108
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,660
And you leave each and every thing, every
particle of it here and die; again you are

109
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,809
born, again you are doing the same thing.

110
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:44,350
You have to run away from comfort.

111
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,559
You must learn how to overcome your comforts.

112
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,910
You must train your body.

113
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,990
Little noise here and there.

114
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,889
Englishman, I am saying Englishman because
we are in England.

115
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,980
Americans are much worse.

116
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,680
Any noise fifty percent would die with any
blasting they hear.

117
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,779
Just by hearing.

118
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,230
They are so sensitive.

119
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,939
I mean they have made their bodies, their
everything, so sensitive that they are really

120
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:17,939
dainty darlings.

121
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:20,639
And can you imagine, read the second part
of it loudly.

122
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,519
Second part of it you just read it.

123
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,920
Where is the second part now?

124
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,519
Gavin – just read it.

125
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,360
Read it out loudly and see for yourself with
these dainty darlings how am I going to do

126
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
this.

127
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,640
Gavin: “Bring me my Bow of burning gold.

128
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,300
Bring me my arrows of desire."

129
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,050
Shri Mataji: What is going to happen?

130
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,040
You have no answer.

131
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,369
Gavin: “Bring me my spear Oh, clouds unfold.

132
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,470
Bring me my chariot of fire."

133
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,910
Shri Mataji: Of fire?

134
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,540
You can’t sit even on a chariot.

135
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
(Laughter) Really!

136
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:02,110
Because it shakes and you have to hold it
tight and you have to stand erect with it.

137
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,420
Gavin: “I will not cease from mental fight
nor shall my sword sleep in my hand.

138
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,670
Till we have built Jerusalem in England’s
green and pleasant land."

139
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,959
Shri Mataji: I think better give swords into
everybody’s hand.

140
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:24,249
Let’s see how many can hold it straight.

141
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:34,379
You see Sahaja Yoga is not a simple thing
like dish washing.

142
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:42,879
It’s a very serious thing and on certain
things you are very well equipped, but on

143
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,920
certain things where you are not equipped,
that must be sustained.

144
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,529
Your strong points are your strong points
so forget about them.

145
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:57,670
Whatever are your weak points, hit them there.

146
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,180
I mean mentally you are very well equipped.

147
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,970
If I have to argue with you I will give up.

148
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,589
I really can’t because you are very knowledgeable
people.

149
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,560
You have read all the books of the world,
you are over read.

150
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,839
You are too great.

151
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,619
But, as far as your body is concerned, your
body is a slave of matter.

152
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:30,629
In a way your mind is also a slave of matter.

153
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:36,959
So to understand that we have to be great
gurus, first of all a guru has to go through

154
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:46,660
a great discipline of self-emancipation, self-emancipation.

155
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:54,369
Great discipline is needed.

156
00:14:54,369 --> 00:15:01,369
And the great discipline of self-emancipation
is, first of all, we must get rid of the idea

157
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,679
of comfort.

158
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,670
You can’t sit on the chair?

159
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,670
Alright.

160
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,769
You can’t sit on a particular chair?

161
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,360
Sit on that chair everyday till that chair
breaks completely.

162
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,079
You cannot sit on the ground?

163
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,029
Sit on the ground, everyday.

164
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,680
You can’t live without one thing?

165
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,740
Try to do that.

166
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,299
That’s how you make your body alright.

167
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:30,540
Make your body your slave and not you the
slave of the body.

168
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,059
Because if you have to become the guru your
body should be such that it should just adjust

169
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:38,549
to everything that you want to do, otherwise
what’s the use?

170
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:43,019
Imagine you have a car which you cannot handle,
will you sit in such a car?

171
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:53,859
You will bash yourself and bash others also
and that’s what you are doing.

172
00:15:53,859 --> 00:16:06,859
One has to realize that: to overcome this
material drag upon yourself, you have to work

173
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:13,709
it out on yourself.

174
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:22,449
Then, once you have controlled this, minimum
of minimum, that you can sleep anywhere you

175
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,449
feel like.

176
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,609
Try to sleep on the ground for a while.

177
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:35,989
That you may do for sun tanning, and people
cannot resist all this nonsense because these

178
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:38,709
are ideas put into you.

179
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,749
They have exploited you.

180
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:44,670
They have told you that: this should be done,
that should be done, this is necessary, that

181
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,110
is necessary.

182
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:53,019
They have to sell their goods.

183
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,069
Try to sometimes fast.

184
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,709
I have prohibited Indians from fasting, because
what they do is to fast.

185
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,790
At the slightest pretext they fast.

186
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,500
I mean, as it is, there is a dearth of food
in India – so they fast.

187
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,100
What is the need for them to fast?

188
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,649
But here it is necessary that people should
learn to fast and should not get attracted

189
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:17,649
towards food so much.

190
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:23,839
I mean the attraction towards food, also,
is a sign that your senses are just driving

191
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,910
you mad, isn’t it?

192
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,910
Think of it.

193
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,940
Now separate yourself from your senses and
see how it drives you mad.

194
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,670
First of all the body, then the senses we
should attack.

195
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,679
The biggest enemy we have is our own tongue.

196
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,899
It acts in two ways.

197
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,820
One is the taste.

198
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,690
The food – taste.

199
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,250
And the second way it attacks is the way we
talk.

200
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,269
Either we don’t talk or when we talk we
just hit.

201
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,510
We cannot be kind.

202
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,510
We cannot be compassionate.

203
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,210
We cannot communicate our heart to anyone.

204
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,050
Control your tongue.

205
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,320
First of all try to control your tongue on
those two things.

206
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,049
You want to eat a cake then don’t eat cake
for a year.

207
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,540
This is the only way you can train your tongue,
I really tell you.

208
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:34,039
Now if you say something harsh all the time,
say you have a way of speaking some sort of

209
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,410
an abuse,[then] try to change it.

210
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,860
Try to change.

211
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:50,920
Try to make your speech a sweet one.

212
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,200
Make it a beautiful one, attractive.

213
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,350
You cannot be a guru in Sahaja Yoga, I can
tell you, with a sharp tongue.

214
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,429
Those gurus are finished.

215
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:07,169
We had gurus before, they used to just sit
with a big stick in the hand.

216
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:10,809
To anybody coming, first they would give twenty-five
nice ones.

217
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:17,370
Still if the fellow would stick on, then they
would say, “Alright now come closer to me."

218
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,990
Then they may slap him twice.

219
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,950
If he could bear that, I mean they could go
to any limit of torturing their disciples,

220
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:38,139
they would put the disciple upside down, in
a well and pull him up and again dip him down,

221
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:40,419
pull him and dip him down – eleven times.

222
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:47,130
And still if he survived then he would help.

223
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,390
They used to take physical test.

224
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:59,409
I mean their disciples had to be really wrestlers,
very healthy people, having a lot of resistance

225
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,809
and stamina, otherwise they would not take.

226
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:07,809
And they said “Erya gabaliyatze karma no
ahe” – “it’s not the job for any Dick,

227
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,010
Tom and Harry."

228
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,830
Thus they would only select one person.

229
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:21,330
They would make him sit on the thorns or on
the nails.

230
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,610
Actually there were seats of nails.

231
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,720
These people were made to sit on the seats
like that.

232
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,380
I mean I’m not telling you lies, you can
find out.

233
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:46,940
And they used to treat them as if they are
on a suicide squad, absolutely like that.

234
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,620
The determination had to be like that.

235
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:58,659
Then they would accept them as a disciple,
not as a guru still.

236
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:04,380
Then beating them nicely morning till evening.

237
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
You have heard of Mr.

238
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,440
Ravi Shankar, a great sitarist.

239
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:19,539
I remember My father was a political adviser
to the king where his guru, Allaudin Khan

240
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:22,019
Sahib, used to live.

241
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:30,260
And I remember that day when I was in college
and he was also young, might be slightly younger

242
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,630
to Me in age, or maybe, I don’t know what
was his age that time.

243
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:44,330
But he was studying with this fellow, this
guru of his and we went there.

244
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:51,130
So My father was a great connoisseur of music
and his guru used to respect My father.

245
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,490
So he asked, that, “Why don’t you play?”

246
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,010
My father asked, to Ravi Shankar.

247
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,490
He said, “Sir please,” his eyes came out,
He pleaded.

248
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,680
He was so frightened!

249
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,870
Then his guru played.

250
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,230
You see, he used to play on Mridangam(actually
Pakhawaj) that’s a kind of double tabla,

251
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,929
a double percussion.

252
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:19,159
He was a great genius, then he went away for
something.

253
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,760
So Ravi Shankar crawled up to My father.

254
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,669
He said, “Sir never ask me, before my guru,
to play.

255
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:27,669
You see?”

256
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:32,260
Then he lifted his hair and showed a big bulge
was there.

257
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,740
“You see, this I got yesterday for playing
one note [wrong].

258
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:39,710
My sitar was broken and this (bump) I’ve
got instead of the sitar!

259
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,889
This is my guru’s Prasad.

260
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,490
So please for heaven’s sake”.

261
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,480
Still he stuck on to him.

262
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:57,759
And you can see the results today he’s Ravi
Shankar.

263
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,100
But you have a Guru who is a mother.

264
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:10,679
I never hit you, I don’t think I have hit
anyone of you.

265
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,679
You got your realization.

266
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,679
In all my compassion I looked after you.

267
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:15,610
I have given you compassion.

268
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,990
I’ve never asked for anything nor have I
complained for anything or grudged for anything.

269
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,380
I have been extremely, extremely, extremely
patient with you.

270
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:36,150
So you have to be My prototype.

271
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:43,460
You are a guru in Sahaja Yoga in this Maha
Yoga, you are not a guru of this type who

272
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:54,559
can only create one disciple in twenty one
thousand years, sort of a thing.

273
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,260
You have got the knowledge of Kundalini much
more than any one of these gurus have got.

274
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:07,289
You have the powers much more than any one
of these gurus have.

275
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:16,210
Indiscriminately this power has been given
to you.

276
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:29,669
Now only those who will come up and grow as
proper trees will be called as gurus.

277
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:36,460
And that is why one has to know how to grow
properly as a guru.

278
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:42,020
First of all you must give up all materialistic
attitude towards Sahaja Yoga.

279
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,850
Many Sahaja Yogis even have an idea that it
should be used for certain purposes.

280
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:59,470
You see, that it should house us, it should
give us some place to live in.

281
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:07,840
Some people have an absurd idea that it should
also provide us food, free.

282
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,429
That it should not touch, at all, our married
life.

283
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,130
We can have our plans with our married life
the way we like.

284
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:22,240
You can lead absolutely, a very selfish, self-centered
married life.

285
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,720
Also some people have an idea that we are
not to spend a single pie for Sahaja Yoga

286
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,590
but take all the advantages out of it.

287
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,409
Such people should never hope to become gurus.

288
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:45,440
They may try to show off but they’ll go
down.

289
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
You have to learn humility.

290
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,179
First of all you have to be humble people.

291
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:02,240
Unless and until you have a large heart you
can never humble down.

292
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,210
You have to be an extremely humble person.

293
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:20,330
Humility doesn’t mean that you bow to a
person who is dominating, it never means that.

294
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,710
But it means a strength within you.

295
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,840
The person who is weak can never be humble.

296
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,379
He can never bear the load like this Mother
Earth bears our load so well, because she’s

297
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:42,269
so great.

298
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:55,380
You have to be strong enough within yourself
to bear the load of your disciples, of people

299
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,919
who try to follow you.

300
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:06,120
Humility should be that: “I was like them,
absolutely like them.

301
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,279
I was nothing.

302
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,090
Without Sahaja Yoga what was I?”

303
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,160
I mean you may be the governor of some place;
alright, so what?

304
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,549
Before God’s eyes what are you?

305
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:19,490
Nothing, nobody knows who you are.

306
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,749
You may be having cars and anything.

307
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:24,200
You might be a very educated anything.

308
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,350
What does it matter in the name (does Mother
mean “realm”?) of God?

309
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,909
You have known that saints have not been so
educated.

310
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:40,389
Christ never went to any university, did he?

311
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:46,789
All these ideas that we have got of our greatness
must be absolutely made zero.

312
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:57,970
The greatness is in humility and sweetness.

313
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:06,690
Speak something that will be dear to others,
that would be appealing to them in a proper

314
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:14,470
discriminating diplomatic manner.

315
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:26,090
Some people in the name of honesty just are
sadistic, or useless.

316
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:33,519
You can talk to people nicely, say something,
in such a way that they feel attracted towards

317
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,559
you.

318
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:51,179
That they feel that there is complete humility,
that you accept them as they are because you

319
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,450
want to give them.

320
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:03,789
All kinds of subtler arrogance also develops
in people, I have seen.

321
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:12,129
I can’t understand how people develop this
kind of arrogance.

322
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:19,080
Like, supposing somebody knows how to do the
puja, take an XYZ.

323
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,140
He becomes so arrogant.

324
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,840
If somebody knows some Sanskrit he becomes
arrogant.

325
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:36,039
If, say, somebody comes to see Me more often
than others, she becomes arrogant.

326
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,950
Somebody manages a hall, he becomes arrogant.

327
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,490
Or somebody programs something, he becomes
arrogant.

328
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,490
Anything you do, first thing that happens
is, in your tongue, you develop a big ego

329
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,700
like that.

330
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,340
You become a sharp tongued person.

331
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,712
Cut your tongue many a times.

332
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:55,712
Punish it.

333
00:29:55,712 --> 00:30:02,779
It has no business to be like that because
it is not going to serve the purpose for which

334
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:04,019
it is there.

335
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:12,380
A guru’s vani is so great that every word
he speaks is a mantra.

336
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:19,889
Every sentence he says opens a complete universe.

337
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,649
It should be that powerful and that beautiful
not to close down anybody’s heart.

338
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:29,960
You speak to someone, the other person says,
“Oh God never see his face."

339
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:39,200
Sahaja Yoga depends on you more than it depends
on Me.

340
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,019
You have to change.

341
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,120
You have to change yourself very much more.

342
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:52,490
Just by taking up some sort of a role or assuming
something great you are not going to progress

343
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,490
at all.

344
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,649
Supposing a little bush says, “I am a tree."

345
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,230
Will it become a tree?

346
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,960
Supposing it behaves like a tree will it become
a tree?

347
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,789
It has to become the tree then there is no
need to behave, you are a tree.

348
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:14,710
A woman walks like a woman and a man walks
like a man.

349
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,649
If you behave like a woman will you become
a woman?

350
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:22,749
It has to be innate.

351
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:23,910
It has to be within us.

352
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:33,559
If you are a guru you are a guru anybody can
see and say, “Ah that’s a guru."

353
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:42,210
Then you can do lots of things.

354
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,929
We are not willing to give up these things,
that’s why we go on catching on the same

355
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:50,360
point, catching on the same point.

356
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:58,700
At least those who are here should decide
today that we are going to change ourselves

357
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
completely.

358
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,350
Let us start on the changing.

359
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:12,760
We meet others, we greet others, talk to them.

360
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,450
We should be able to talk.

361
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,190
There are some people who just don’t know
how to talk.

362
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,250
They just don’t talk, they are all the time
– never heard their voice.

363
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,429
If they telephone I can’t even recognize
because I’ve never heard their voices before.

364
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,850
You must talk.

365
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,279
Open out.

366
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,100
What is there to have fear?

367
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:40,139
Humility doesn’t mean fear, it means complete
love.

368
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:46,100
You must talk, open out, be interesting.

369
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,419
Try to do something for others.

370
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,380
I have been saying this again and again.

371
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,539
You have to all become gurus.

372
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,499
I am just a Mother.

373
00:32:55,499 --> 00:33:00,190
And Mother is the first and the last guru
for everyone.

374
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:07,120
That’s how I’m your Guru and I’m the
Guru of all the Gurus.

375
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,860
But you have to become your own guru.

376
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:22,850
And for that you have to think that you have
to hold swords in your hand.

377
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,869
Not only to hold swords in your hand, you
have teach others to hold the swords.

378
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:32,450
What should be the character of that man who
has to guide others?

379
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,070
He himself cannot hold the sword in his hand.

380
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,799
What is he going to teach to others?

381
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,200
You just tell Me that – a simple question.

382
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:52,220
At least you should have that personality
that can hold the sword in the hand.

383
00:33:52,220 --> 00:34:06,399
So the first thing one has to know is to absolutely
enslave your body and enslave your senses.

384
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,710
You can give justification.

385
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,750
I know people know how to give justification.

386
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,820
“I said this because he said that."

387
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,880
It’s not that.

388
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:29,160
It is you who do not know that you are harming
yourself.

389
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,130
Try to get out of it.

390
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:37,200
You are asking but now you have to face, you
have to give.

391
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,560
This asking is over now, finished.

392
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,420
You’ve got everything.

393
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,360
You are not aware you have got everything
now within yourself.

394
00:34:49,360 --> 00:35:02,240
Just reverse the position and you can give
to others.

395
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:14,820
But if you’re hankering still, worried about
these nonsensical things then nobody is going

396
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,350
to respect you.

397
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,210
I would suggest one thing, that: take to detachment.

398
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,760
In a way a sanyasa absolutely a sanyasa.

399
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
You know I am a sanyasi.

400
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
Though I live in a household and all that,
I am not bothered about things.

401
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:39,460
I am a sanyasi, but the day I will announce
that I have taken a sanyasa people will be

402
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,300
much more impressed by Me than they are today.

403
00:35:47,300 --> 00:36:00,330
If a person is over attached to things, attached
to money, attached to this, that, and all

404
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,510
those things, such a person is not going to
impress others in spiritual matters.

405
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:13,190
You can be a nice prime minister of England,
but you have no place in Sahaja Yoga if you

406
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:16,870
do not have a way of detachment.

407
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:24,920
That doesn’t mean that you become hippies
by any chance- not at all.

408
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:32,850
But it means that you become detached.

409
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:42,690
Specially it is very important for you to
develop that – a detachment.

410
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,980
Detach yourself from things that you are supposed
to be possessing.

411
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,730
I can tell you, you cannot take anything with
you.

412
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,680
Can you?

413
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,700
We know that we are not going to take.

414
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,180
Now you are aware of it, that you’re not
going to take, also.

415
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:11,500
It’s not that you are not aware.

416
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,600
Then why are you attached?

417
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,430
All kinds of disgraceful behavior ensues when
you are attached.

418
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,220
Become a sanyasi.

419
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:35,900
It doesn’t mean you wear that yellow or
red and all kinds of horrible dresses.

420
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,870
But from inside you become a sanyasi.

421
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:49,010
That’s the best way you conquer your void.

422
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,850
The void question first comes because of wrong
guru.

423
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,880
Of course, no doubt about it.

424
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,480
If you have been to a wrong guru then the
void will be very, very bad no doubt.

425
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,590
Because you have followed a wrong guru you
will always have to remember that you have

426
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:14,340
to follow the right Guru, out and out.

427
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,520
Absolute full surrendering otherwise it will
never go down.

428
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,520
And if you start sort of “Yes I know, Mother
is alright,” this kind of thing will not

429
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
work out.

430
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,350
You have to go all out to accept the right
Guru if you have a void problem.

431
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:48,330
And this void problem is so deep, is so deep
that, first of all, it indicates Ekadesha

432
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,330
Rudra.

433
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:57,640
Ekadesha Rudra is a very dangerous thing because
it can give you from left to right all kinds

434
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,950
of funny things, even cancer, epilepsy, all
kinds of diseases.

435
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:14,350
So those who have been to other gurus have
to go all out to neutralize it on the void

436
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,350
part.

437
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:22,500
And for them it is necessary to really decide
to become a sanyasi.

438
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,510
In the sense that – don’t get attached
to material things too much.

439
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,310
Because from these gurus all kinds of things
have come to you.

440
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:36,700
Some people might have picked up bad things
like telling lies.

441
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:44,410
You see, even I’ve seen people who go to
these gurus can pick up some sort of a horrible

442
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,000
intrigue; intriguing nature.

443
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,280
Anything they can pick up.

444
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,820
I have seen people who have been to gurus.

445
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,580
They have such horrible spirits in them that,
when they come to Sahaja Yoga also, they intrigue

446
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
with Sahaja Yogis.

447
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
They intrigue!

448
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,890
You see [whether] their bhoots intrigue or
they intrigue – God alone knows, but go

449
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,400
on intriguing against Sahaja Yoga.

450
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,430
They talk to people against Sahaja Yoga they
do this, they are not aware.

451
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,140
And their void goes out again and again.

452
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,580
So for anyone who has followed any such things,
any practices of this kind or even self-meditation

453
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:34,340
or anything like, must get to it and see to
it that you really surrender fully to the

454
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,820
right Guru.

455
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,670
Fully, hundred percent.

456
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,900
Complete obedience.

457
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:54,010
Not to judge or not to even ask questions.

458
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:58,070
That would help very much in the void.

459
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:04,910
But I can tell you spirituality is such great
thing that, if you accept that kind of obedience,

460
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,700
it fills you up with such powers, tremendous
powers.

461
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,530
Obedience is the key of becoming the best
guru.

462
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,490
If you do not know how to respect, nobody
is going to respect you.

463
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:21,470
If you have not been under any command you
cannot command anyone.

464
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:33,570
Surrendering is the best way for void people
especially.

465
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:40,370
First of all you must surrender completely,
blindly you can say.

466
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,860
Just jump into it.

467
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,790
Do not reason it out.

468
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,040
Complete surrendering.

469
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,530
Once you have done that you will be surprised
how you’ll be so blessed with the powers

470
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:06,300
of a guru that you’ll rise to heights and
you will do all that William Blake has said.

471
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:14,750
Because it is like a drop submerging into
the ocean and becoming the ocean.

472
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,770
And you know the ocean is the Guru, not a
drop.

473
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:28,850
It’s the ocean and the ocean has everything
in it.

474
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,790
So we have to learn from the ocean to be the
ocean by becoming the ocean yourself.

475
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:49,000
I have told you in many ways how it is important
that we have to have many gurus of Sahaja

476
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,140
Yoga.

477
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,140
But if Sahaja fails it fails because of Sahaja
Yogis not because of Me, always.

478
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:03,770
What I hear, “Mother we went there, there
were two Sahaja Yogis they were very rude

479
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,910
to us so we would like to talk to you and
not to them."

480
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,490
It’s very common.

481
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:17,340
Or a fight between the two Sahaja Yogis or
a misunderstanding or all sorts of things

482
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,470
between sahaja yogis.

483
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,220
You are the reflection of Sahaja Yoga.

484
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:28,670
You are the mirrors, not Me.

485
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,880
You have to reflect Sahaja Yoga.

486
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,820
So first of all you have to become good reflectors
– the good gurus.

487
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,840
Now look at these gurus who move about.

488
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:48,330
They have millions and millions of disciples
except that they are crooks of the first order.

489
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:54,100
They have no other qualifications to be gurus.

490
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,720
They have no idea of Kundalini they cannot
raise Kundalini.

491
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,000
They are not even holy people leave alone
anything else.

492
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,090
They don’t deserve to enter into any temple
of God leave alone His Kingdom.

493
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:15,710
They are from hell and they have mesmerized
people and they have got their disciples.

494
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:24,560
You can also [raise the Kundalini], just through
your character and through your abilities

495
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:31,240
as Sahaja Yogis, which are tremendous.

496
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:37,320
Even those who are great gurus in India cannot
raise the Kundalini the way you can raise.

497
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,590
Under their finger?

498
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,640
They can’t believe it.

499
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,100
It’s Shri Ganesha’s powers you have got.

500
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,860
Look at the surrendering of Shri Ganesha.

501
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,920
Look at His surrendering.

502
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,990
Completely surrendered to his Mother.

503
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,990
Who is wiser than Him?

504
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,840
And in His wisdom He has chosen complete surrender
to His Mother.

505
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,440
To Him His Mother is Guru, She is Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha everything, even SadaShiva

506
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,260
is Her, – His Mother; nothing else.

507
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,710
And his power of Kundalini raising is within
you.

508
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,530
You’ve got it.

509
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,190
You are made after his power.

510
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:43,720
He is holiness, he’s auspicious, he’s
innocence.

511
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,700
A guru has to be innocent, has to be an innocent
person.

512
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,730
His innocence can be crafty.

513
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:00,520
But innocence should be crafty, he should
not be crafty.

514
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,450
Innocence is the power which works the craftiness.

515
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,560
It’s the Krishna shakti.

516
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,760
It does.

517
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
It works out.

518
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,070
Suddenly you face it.

519
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,840
You try anything it will be there.

520
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:25,210
And he depends on his powers and not on his
own methods of maneuvering things.

521
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:36,260
But how many of you are religiously working
it out morning, evening, every moment of life?

522
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:43,610
How many of you are thinking that we are on
the path of becoming full fledged gurus of

523
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,910
Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

524
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,980
You are nothing else but that.

525
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,520
How many of you decide like that?

526
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Every moment.

527
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,970
It’s very easy just to say, “Oh it’s
alright I don’t believe in it."

528
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:05,550
Then what are you going to do?

529
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:09,950
What are you without Sahaja Yoga?

530
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,360
Think of it.

531
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,260
You can say, “I don’t want to do it."

532
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,010
You’ll have to do it.

533
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,210
You are in it now.

534
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:25,160
You better do it.

535
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,820
You have to do it fast.

536
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:36,520
For heavens sake better do it fast.

537
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,730
Achieve it!

538
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,390
You have all the powers believe Me, you have
all the powers.

539
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:48,840
Believe Me, you are better than all these
gurus put together.

540
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:58,070
But be humble, do not talk big.

541
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,000
And do not become silent bores also.

542
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,540
I mean some of them are real silent bores.

543
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,630
They cannot be gurus I can tell you this much.

544
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,060
That’s another quality.

545
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,300
They’re absolutely boring people.

546
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,060
Nobody wants to stay with them.

547
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:21,140
I mean, you have to have people around to
be a guru, you can’t be a guru of yourself!

548
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,140
(laughter).

549
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,750
If everybody says, “Oh, he’s such a boring
person,” nobody will be there.

550
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,110
You have to be interesting.

551
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,990
You have to be interesting.

552
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,990
You have to be dynamic.

553
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,980
You should know some stories here and there.

554
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,100
You have to make them laugh.

555
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,140
They should enjoy you.

556
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,490
This is Sahaja Yoga guruship.

557
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:57,620
You see for such boring gurus one or two would
stick on if they are equally boring or more

558
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,690
boring.

559
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:05,310
But such gurus are not going to help us in
Sahaja Yoga.

560
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,010
They are not.

561
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:15,930
You have to be joyous, cheerful, helpful,
understanding, concerned.

562
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:24,280
You have to be concerned about others.

563
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:31,540
You have to behave in a way that they feel
that you are the security for them.

564
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,230
But that doesn’t mean that you get after
one person.

565
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:42,230
You see, everything you tell them goes into
some sort of a mad mould, I don’t know how

566
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,230
it happens – whatever I say.

567
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,650
For example, I say you should be concerned.

568
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,310
Here I find that people start then, “Alright
I am concerned."

569
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,670
So they start working on a person.

570
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,360
And then they’ll come, “Mother my left
hand is finished.

571
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,570
Why?

572
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,890
I was working on such a person."

573
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:06,890
Why?

574
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,160
What was the need?

575
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,510
You need not.

576
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,320
That’s not your job.

577
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,140
Let them also work.

578
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,150
You must know how to make them work also.

579
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:23,050
Otherwise, you see these lazy lumps will use
you all the time.

580
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:29,560
Let them also, tell them to get up and work,
arise.

581
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:36,910
Why can’t they work it out?

582
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,910
They can work it out themselves.

583
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,080
But then don’t tell them, “Now you work
it out."

584
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,060
Not like that.

585
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,420
Then another extreme can start.

586
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:50,700
You should say, “Now see, you have a left
side problem and I don’t think that you

587
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,101
should make me work it out.

588
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:54,610
I think you can work it out, lets see.

589
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,920
I too had the same time type, let’s work
it out.

590
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,450
You better put your left hand towards the
photograph, put right hand outside.

591
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,400
Do this way that way.

592
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,780
Beat yourself.

593
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,750
Left side is Adi Shakti’s this thing.

594
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,440
You can ask for Mahakali’s powers it can
be worked out."

595
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,500
Give him all the knowledge say, “Now try,
try yourself."

596
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,790
Because if you’re obliging too much also,
then you make them dwarfs, you see.

597
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:28,690
You have to be a tree which makes others grow
into trees and not to make them dwarfs under

598
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,690
it.

599
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,290
You see, no grass can even grow under such
trees, leave alone trees.

600
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,890
Even the grass can’t grow if the trees are
of this type.

601
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:46,350
So you should be actually the tree of brilliance,
of sun, sun’s rays.

602
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:52,190
From you the sun’s rays should flow and
they should grow.

603
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,520
Not to obstruct every growth of your disciples.

604
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:11,960
What sort of a guru could he be, whose disciples
are all toddlers or still sucking their thumbs?

605
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:18,530
So you should be a guru of a caliber that
makes others grow too.

606
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:24,240
I have hopes that my disciples will grow more
than I am.

607
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:32,830
I have hopes we’ll see that.

608
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:38,080
That’s my desire, that’s what I want,
that my disciples should grow.

609
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,603
I mean, that will be my pride.

610
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:50,060
Like Ganesha grew more than His own Mother,
who created Him.

611
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,620
That’s what is My desire.

612
00:52:52,620 --> 00:53:01,290
And that’s what I want you to realize that
you are the hope of the world.

613
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:06,650
Either you should not have taken birth in
England.

614
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:15,910
If you have taken, you have more responsibility
not to be English and to be universal, because

615
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:24,250
you have taken birth in the heart of the universe.

616
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,270
You cannot be small-minded.

617
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,380
You cannot be chicken hearted.

618
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:42,080
Either you are frightened or you are aggressive
– this is an impossible situation.

619
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:53,350
You have to be so strong that nothing should
make you frightened, and such a person is

620
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:54,640
the most benevolent personality.

621
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,910
He’s not frightened of anyone, why should
he harm anyone?

622
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:18,400
Today I hope you people really don’t listen
to my lecture but put it in your heart, and

623
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:26,700
understand that you have to become very dignified
majestic gurus of this universe.

624
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:36,750
I would like to ask William Blake what is
he doing.

625
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:44,720
When is he going to take his birth on this
earth?

626
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,290
When people of his caliber are going to be
born in this country, or they are all running

627
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,570
away again to some other place to be born?

628
00:54:53,570 --> 00:55:01,940
Marriage system of England is wretched.

629
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,890
You cannot adopt those methods that these
people are having.

630
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,730
You want to have the great people to be born
to you and every time you are running towards

631
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,820
the divorce cases.

632
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:14,520
How can they be born in this country?

633
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,950
You have to give up all these wretched systems
of this country.

634
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:26,310
The good of this country should be taken,
whatever is good in it, and transform this

635
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,210
country into a beautiful thing.

636
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:36,120
I mean if you really love this country then
create it into a lovable place, isn’t it?

637
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:42,960
You must try to destroy all that is retarding
the progress, the spiritual progress of this

638
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,980
country if you are a real Englishman.

639
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,569
Real is the word.

640
00:55:53,569 --> 00:56:07,150
You should not be proud of all the weaknesses
that have crawled up in all these hills and

641
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,510
dales.

642
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,660
All unholy thoughts, all inauspicious behaviors,
all must be discarded.

643
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,050
We are not that.
