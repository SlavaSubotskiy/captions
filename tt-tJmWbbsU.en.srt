1
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,660
Nice to be back again in Hampstead.

2
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,660
I always enjoyed Hampstead

3
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,700
because,as I have told, you in London,

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,000
many people who were

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,820
great spiritual lived in this area.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,980
They preferred it to other places.

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,040
So I believe that many people who live in this area

8
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,240
must be also spiritual,

9
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:32,400
must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-Realisation.

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,920
It’s a very important t ime: when you are born.

11
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,580
It’s the most important in the history of the universe.

12
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,440
You are created a human being to become your Spirit.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,880
There’s nothing in between.

14
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,740
If you have intelligence, pure intelligence,

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
you can see through all that.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,620
You have to test your intelligence on this.

17
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,400
Whatever we think and whatever we conceive

18
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,860
and whatever we try to organise ourselves into,

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,620
mostly comes from our conditionings,

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
not from the Spirit, because we have not touched the Spirit.

21
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,800
But innately we have got a sense to know

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,200
that these are very important times;

23
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,360
that there must be something great in the atmosphere,

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,180
that there are so many people who are seeking.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,240
It’s something remarkable. If this misses your attention,

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
that means you are not alert.

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,800
There are people of all types, all kinds. But seekers

28
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,240
of this calibre have been very few.

29
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,400
Now England has its own problems,

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,660
and London has its own peculiarities.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Despite the fact I have been in London for about

32
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
eight and a half years,

33
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,300
I feel that

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,340
the reception of the truth has been very, very poor.

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
Maybe, I am luckier than others.

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,420
It’s the conditioning, again I would say, of another type

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,200
that prevails [in] the minds.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,100
First we had, about twenty-five years back

39
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,740
the conditioning of the science,

40
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,240
but scientists themselves have refuted it.

41
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,320
They themselves have challenged the science

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,300
and they themselves know that it’s not such a happy affair,

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,220
just to be a scientist.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Then comes the intellectuals.

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,960
The books started pouring in, in the market:

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,660
all kinds of books.You can read about everything.

47
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Everyone knows about everything!

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,080
And once you start reading about them,

49
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,200
you conceive something;

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,140
your conceptions are built about the truth also.

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,580
The thing you have never seen,

52
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,380
the thing you have never felt, you cannot conceive it,

53
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,460
it is to be seen.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,780
Like I had never seen Hampstead before,

55
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,640
and the first idea of my husband was to buy a house in Hampstead

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,140
it’s surprising! I was very happy at that point.

57
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,300
So I said, “Let’s go and see!”

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Without seeing it, if I had some conception about it,

59
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,360
it would have been wrong.

60
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,320
My seeing is different from others, I must say.

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I liked the place immensely,

62
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,660
but he,from the point of view [of] distances and all of that he said,

63
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,380
“It’s not good.” And naturally his ideas prevailed;doesn’t matter.

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,100
But seeing, itself, makes you understand.

65
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,480
But what is Self-Realisation? It’s not only seeing.

66
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,040
When you come to Hampstead you don’t see it.

67
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
You feel it.

68
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:34,560
You feel it. Now many people say you can feel it, but the idea of feeling is also quite conditioned.

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Like, some children like to cuddle a little doll.

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,640
They feel the doll. But God knows how far they feel it.

71
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
They might be feeling it physically,

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,620
or emotionally also they might be feeling some sort of a security with the doll, maybe.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
Psychologically they might be deriving some joy out of that

74
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,320
doll itself.

75
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
Or maybe the image,

76
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,200
which has some sort of an attraction

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,360
of some sort of a thing that is built within their unconscious,

78
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
that they feel so close to that.

79
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
But a person who is a realised-soul

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,380
does not feel a doll that way, even if it’s a child.

81
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,900
It’s surprising. You must watch a realised child

82
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,700
getting to a doll. It’s very surprising.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,280
For example, I bought two dolls from London for my grandchildren and they rejected completely.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,300
They said, “What sort of dolls these are?” I said, “Why?”

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
“They are unhappy!” I said, “They are not unhappy.”

86
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,640
“No, see their lips!”

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,800
You see, the lips of the dolls here is all just like a duck’s beak.

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,700
They said, “They have resentment. They are angry.

89
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
They are not realised!”

90
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,860
That’s it!

91
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,540
If you are a happy person then the whole get-up of your face changes,

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,740
and they could see, they could feel it.

93
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
They rejected: “We don’t want these dolls.”

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,380
And then next time when I had to go I had to go

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,260
round the whole places. First of all they were plastics;

96
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
so plastics they don’t like.

97
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,660
They don’t like plastic. Somehow realised people don’t like plastics,automatically.

98
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,740
They wouldn’t wear plastic clothes,  they wouldn’t wear nylon clothes,

99
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
they wouldn’t wear mixed clothes: very difficult.

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,780
They must have cotton clothes. Even if they have one, they’ll wear that the whole day,

101
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,260
morning, evening, every time, the same thing.

102
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,340
You see, it’s a different sensitivity which we do not have before Realisation.

103
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
They have a different sensitivity.

104
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:58,180
And the coefficients of a doll which emits vibrations they like.

105
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,000
But it’s very difficult to get such dolls nowadays; impossible.

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,780
Because where are these artists who are realised-souls who used to make dolls?

107
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
I have seen they make their own dolls,

108
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,760
out of something:. sometimes my saris they will use or something.

109
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
And sleep with those.

110
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,240
It’s something to be understood that, after Realisation,

111
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,580
the thing you feel is not what you feel through your heart or through your conditioning of ages, also, maybe.

112
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,580
Like if you have been living with a woman

113
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,260
for many years with blue eyes,

114
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,580
then you may like a doll with blue eyes. You may,

115
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
because you have that image into your head.

116
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,380
You may like. Or you may have a nanny of with blue eyes

117
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,120
you may like a doll like that.

118
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,940
It’s all psychological.  It’s conditioning very deep in you.

119
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,520
But Spirit has no conditioning. It’s a free thing.

120
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,420
What does it feel? It feels the joy of Creation,

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,220
which we cannot.

122
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Before Realisation we cannot feel.

123
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,940
You see, when we see something, where is the joy?

124
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,520
Now, for example, if a fussy man comes here he’ll say,

125
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,940
“Oh, God, what a thing! I have to take out my shoes

126
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,140
and sit like that! And the chairs were horrible!

127
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,920
And couldn’t sit: very uncomfortable!

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
And the colour was all white.”

129
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,160
He couldn’t bear it.

130
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
And I don’t know: all sorts of things.

131
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,760
The thoughts will start.

132
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,480
If you buy something – same thing.

133
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
If you see something – same thing.

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,200
There’s no joy!

135
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,340
We just start thinking!

136
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,920
Or if not, to avoid that, you may start a poetry about it.

137
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,720
It’s sometimes so artificial, some of the poetry.

138
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,760
So artificially put there that you can see it clearly

139
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,800
clearly that this man is just a sadist, wants to make you cry.

140
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
Like Lord Byron!

141
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,060
You can see it so clearly that this man has no sincerity of purpose.

142
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
He’s not sincere.

143
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,460
That sincerity you cannot feel

144
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
unless and until you are realised

145
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
because such a poem you won’t like at all,

146
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,600
whether you understand the language or not.

147
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,740
The whole tone of it will emit horrible vibrations;

148
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,820
it’s absolutely the essence of everything is nothing but vibrations.

149
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,520
Everything is nothing but vibrations; the rest is all zero.

150
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,800
We are nothing but our vibrations

151
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,280
which are

152
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,960
emitted because we are now connected with the Spirit.

153
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,100
But otherwise also, whether you are connected with Spirit

154
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,960
or not, you emit vibrations.

155
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,440
But these are the vibrations without the light in it,

156
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,980
and you can feel the vibrations of a person out and out.

157
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,600
You can feel, feel how.

158
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,500
You can feel on your centres.

159
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,040
All your centres become active and you start feeling on your centres.

160
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,140
That means all these five centres, six, seven centres you start feeling.

161
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Even you may not feel in your fingers.

162
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,940
Some of us Sahaja yogis may not feel also even today after so many days because their Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad.

163
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,200
They must have smoked in,  I think, ten lives,

164
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,920
and must have been horrible Vishuddhi Chakra,

165
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,600
and maybe that’s why it’s all on the myelin sheath of the nerves that you cannot feel it.

166
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,800
That’s a different point.

167
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,700
But you will feel it on your centres.

168
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,140
And the feeling on the centre is emitted in your nervous system.

169
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,420
And when it comes to it you feel it on your centres

170
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
and you know, you just know.

171
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,320
And you know it as vibratory awareness.

172
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,060
This vibratory awareness has to grow, no doubt.

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,280
The sensitivity has to grow, no doubt.

174
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
But, first you must touch it.

175
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,760
If it has not even touched, then how can it grow?

176
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,160
But we are so conditioned that we take to things

177
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,120
which superficially are very appealing.

178
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

179
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,580
It’s truth. It’s reality.

180
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,340
Of course, you cannot pay for reality. I mean, how can you pay?

181
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
If it is reality, you cannot pay for it.

182
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,220
That’s one simple thing.

183
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,820
You cannot artificially say you are realised-soul.  You cannot.

184
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,920
There was a girl, I met her in Portugal,

185
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,640
mischievous one, and she wanted to stick on with the Sahaja yogis

186
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,000
because she was very negative and she wanted to disturb the Sahaja yogis.

187
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
And she came to the programme

188
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,980
and she told me, “Oh, I am feeling very well, Mother. I am feeling vibrations!”

189
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,520
I just looked at her.

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
I kept quiet: because I knew she was not.

191
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to create trouble.

192
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,420
But second day when she turned up I said, “Why are you telling me lies?”

193
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
“No, no, no!” I said, “Yes,

194
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,240
you are telling me lies. You have to be sincere.

195
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
What are you going to gain?”

196
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,620
Say, you are mischievous.You are playing into the hands of negative forces:

197
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,260
what is your gain?

198
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,640
You are the Spirit. The Spirit is within you.

199
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,420
You have to become the Spirit.

200
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,180
It’s your own joy, is your own property, is your own Self:

201
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,240
which is not known to you.

202
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Why not be honest about it

203
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,740
and get to it instead of playing tricks

204
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,260
with yourself?

205
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
And then playing tricks with other Sahaja yogis:

206
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,720
what is the use? What is the gain?

207
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,220
Why are you playing into the hands of the satanic force?

208
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,520
Why don’t you play into the hands of the Divine force?”

209
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,940
She said, “No, no, Mother, I am feeling it!”

210
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,340
I said, “See, don’t tell me lies.

211
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
I know for definite you are not feeling it,

212
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,920
and if you are not going to be honest you are not going to come to my programme at all.

213
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
You have to be honest yourself.

214
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,360
If you are not honest I am not going to have you here.”

215
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,200
But dishonesty sometimes reaches a very absurd limit,

216
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,480
because honesty is only up to which point you can see.

217
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Say, you can see the colour

218
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,800
is white – up to that you are honest.

219
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
But if you start saying, “I know who has painted it,

220
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,540
and I know who has done the job and I know who is the company,”

221
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,160
and all that, that’s not true.

222
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,400
So honesty is up to the point you know.

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,160
Beyond that, if you start saying things because you have read somewhere something

224
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,760
or you have heard something,

225
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,760
that’s wrong, that’s not being honest.

226
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,480
So we have to have honesty and open-mindedness.

227
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,800
You have to be open-minded and honest,

228
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,460
so that you see for yourself.

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
Because as I told you it’s not like other places where you can just go and become members– nothing.

230
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,120
First you have get your Realisation.

231
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,520
Secondly, you have to grow into it.

232
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,140
Those who cannot do, will be left out.

233
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,800
You can’t help it.

234
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
How far can you move it people?

235
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,920
How far can you tell them?

236
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,420
There’s no binding force.

237
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,180
You are completely free to leave it or to take it.

238
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,220
If you want to take it,

239
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
well and good. If you don’t want to take it,

240
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,220
no one is going to force you at all in this,! Because you cannot force.

241
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,820
You can force a horse to eat,

242
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,160
that is possible;

243
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,440
but you cannot force any human being to be a realised-soul.

244
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
You cannot.

245
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,300
Not only that he has to ask for it

246
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,120
but he has to,later on, work for it.

247
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
It is a tremendous thing you are asking for

248
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,280
and it’s the greatest thing that you are achieving.

249
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,180
It is made easy, I should say.

250
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,460
The times are such. It looks easy but it’s not so easy.

251
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,680
In Sahaja Yoga there are more drop-outs than sticking people.

252
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,960
Naturally, because you have to be honest.

253
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
You have to be very honest with it

254
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,080
and you have to give a try.

255
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,400
Like in Spain I met about five, six ladies

256
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,300
and two men who came to see me.

257
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,380
When I came out I was very reluctant

258
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,300
to have anything to do with them.

259
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,660
But, all the Sahaja yogis were so impressed.

260
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,720
I don’t know why.

261
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,440
“Oh, Mother they are so good. You don’t know,

262
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,340
they came and looked at your photograph and they did this and all that.”

263
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,320
I said, “Now, it’s all right if you want I will try!

264
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,580
But somehow I don’t think much is going to work out.”

265
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,680
And they thought they had found such a great bunch of people,

266
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
who are real Sahaja yogis of the thing.

267
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,440
I said, “Did you see their vibrations?”

268
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,380
They said, “No, Mother we were waiting for you.”

269
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,400
I said, “All right, doesn’t matter. I’ll have a look at them.”

270
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,900
And they said,

271
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,640
first question they asked,“Mother, why is it Sahaja yogis don’t smoke?”

272
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
I said, “Because they don’t want to.”

273
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
I mean, is that a question to ask?

274
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,860
I mean, if you smoke is it very normal?

275
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,840
I just couldn’t understand this question.

276
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
She said, “No, we don’t want to lose our freedom

277
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,820
of smoking and freedom of drinking.”

278
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
I said, “Do you think you are free?

279
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,480
You are a slave.

280
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,700
You can’t give up even if you want to.

281
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,160
I can free you from that or your Kundalini can free you but you cannot.

282
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,120
Even if you want you cannot give up,

283
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,660
but here they just give up.

284
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I don’t tell them, I never force them,

285
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,940
but it just happens because if you get the nectar of life you don’t care for other nonsensical things.

286
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,420
It’s simple as that.”

287
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,100
But they were so frightened with the Sahaja yogis’ style of life,

288
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
means they don’t smoke and drink every night, they said, “This is impossible”.

289
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,900
They gave up.

290
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,820
Can you imagine? At the first talk we had!

291
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,420
But then we had people with such tremendous characters.

292
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,060
They came for the program.

293
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,260
I was so very happy, extremely happy and joyous.

294
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,120
Everybody said, “Mother, why?”

295
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,520
They were little, sometimes,

296
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,080
not so much receptive, maybe, according to Sahaja yogis.

297
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,200
But I could feel my vibrations sucked into them,

298
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,600
absolutely flowing: the energy just getting into them,

299
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,580
and suddenly they said, “Ah! Got it.”

300
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,360
And tremendous people!

301
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,400
Very well-educated also, some of them.

302
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,280
But extremely well-versed about what we have to achieve.

303
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,520
I was surprised

304
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,000
in Spain there are people who know Sanskrit so well and about everything,

305
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
about Chaitanya and all that.

306
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
They know so well.

307
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,320
It’s most surprising, and I used to think only scholarships exist in England.

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
No. I was surprised.

309
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
All of them knew about chakras.

310
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,200
They knew about what it means. Everything they have sorted it out.

311
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,180
I said,“When did you start?”

312
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,140
They said, “About, when we were, I think, ten years of age.”

313
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,600
I said, “Ten years of age? How?”

314
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,120
They said, “We, we just couldn’t be satisfied with what was the answer here.”

315
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
“Such grown-up people,” I said.

316
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,400
From ten years of age. So many of them!

317
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
And you should have seen the way they were!

318
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,400
And they recognise Sahaja Yoga and the tremendous effect it has and the work that it is doing.

319
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,480
You will be amazed the way these people behaved towards Sahaj Yoga.

320
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,260
Then I said, “Next time, I am not staying in London – Spain.”

321
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Yeah, really, I tell you!

322
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,780
Just the kind of reception. There’s no barrier at all in their minds.

323
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,800
It’s such pure intelligence, sharp, to see this is the thing

324
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
– where are we running.

325
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,300
And really I felt that, eight years I have wasted in this country, that time.

326
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,760
Really for a moment I just felt, “Oh, God!”

327
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,600
But you know the importance of this country is so great

328
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
because it’s the heart of the universe.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,320
I have to labour through it! And such lethargy and such inertia

330
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,260
and explanations.  Intellectuals have a very good,

331
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,420
an easy-chair way of looking at things, very easy-chair way of looking at things.

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Easy-chair politicians they are.

333
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,060
“Well, it’s very interesting.”

334
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,360
Many a times I have heard [this], “It’s very interesting, you know, Mother, what you have given us.

335
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,560
Very nice, yes, yes.”

336
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,660
It’s very common! But there, for them, it was a heavenly gift because they knew what it was.

337
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,260
What’s the use of all the scholarship of Lord Byron

338
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,760
when you can’t recognise Christ?

339
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,100
When you can’t recognise the truth?

340
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
What’s this education for?

341
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,940
I was amazed at these people. They never went to Cambridge and they were not Oxbridges.

342
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,460
Most surprising!

343
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,220
And they were people of great intelligence, very well-versed.

344
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,520
And in Spain!

345
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,780
Can you imagine?

346
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
The same I will say of Italy.

347
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,980
Italians are supposed to be very dishonest and this,  that, I have heard.

348
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,060
Nobody was dishonest with me

349
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,280
as far as I am concerned: very upright, straightforward and tremendous people.

350
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,000
Just my photograph convinced them.

351
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,400
They said, “The face shows!” They hate the Pope.

352
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,940
They hate the Papal things. They know all about Pope. Everything they know.

353
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,280
They have sorted out everything. But to know so much about chakras and things,

354
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,660
I was amazed.

355
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,200
They knew about tantrism. They knew that Hitler used tantrikas.

356
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,620
They knew that Hitler used all these things. Actually, they told me. So I was amazed how did they know?

357
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,620
I dared not say this before because everyone who is following all these tantrikas would have been angry with me.

358
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
But that’s what Hitler did.

359
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
And so much they knew!

360
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,620
One of the boys was just, you can call him a hippie or whatever he may be.

361
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,360
He went on the street shouting, “Oh, Mother has come now!

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,720
The Mother has come! The Holy Mother has come! What are you doing now?

363
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,060
Come along to the programme!” He was shouting on the street like “Eureka!”

364
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,560
And a learned man, in the real sense of the word.

365
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,820
It’s such a pleasure to talk to them, such a pleasure, I tell you.

366
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,340
I think it is time that English should come down a little,

367
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,900
really.

368
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,540
Australia again: just look at Australians,

369
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,240
they are supposed to be convicts.

370
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,700
Supposed to be; I can’t understand.

371
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,660
You see, this high-handedness, or we can call it

372
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,640
condescendingly to watch something

373
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,660
is not proper, it’s not proper.

374
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,400
You must come down in humility, otherwise things will not work out,

375
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I can tell you. You have to humble down.

376
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,780
We have Hampstead: so what?

377
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
What have you done to Blake?

378
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,220
Can you understand him?

379
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,680
Do you know who he was?

380
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,760
Do you know what he wanted to say?

381
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
What he wanted to communicate?

382
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,060
Even in his programme, where I went,

383
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,480
to see his beautiful paintings, people were watching how many nude women and nude men he has produced.

384
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,380
With all this, and this [low] level, I just couldn’t understand it.

385
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,100
You must understand holiness.

386
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,040
You must understand auspiciousness. You must understand sublime things.

387
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,660
Something great that is beyond

388
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,260
just now, but is within your reach because you are sublime.

389
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
You are not a low-level animal.

390
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,920
You are sublime.

391
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,460
You are the Spirit.

392
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,100
Unless and until you really assume that situation

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
with that pride and glory,

394
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,840
to God you are nothing.

395
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
You are just zero, useless.

396
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,720
And this is what I’ll find always, new people coming,

397
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,340
even in your Hampstead, Magda, and they just disappear.

398
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,140
It’s like one lecture, it’s free. “All right, let’s go and see Mother.”That’s all.

399
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,820
All these experiences, even in a country like Portugal,

400
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,180
Portugal.

401
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,320
The way people have done, Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

402
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
I go there for three days only.

403
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,240
Only for three days in a year. I must have gone there only twice so far.

404
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,060
Look at them:

405
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,880
young people taking up responsibility, working it out for their country.

406
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,880
So much they understand of auspiciousness.

407
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,560
How have we lost all that sense of holiness and auspiciousness?

408
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,340
We are running after people who are collecting money from you,

409
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,880
giving you a circus.

410
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,000
How can you?

411
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,640
How can you not find out that this is not the truth, that you have to be the truth,

412
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,000
that you are something great?

413
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,560
Why can’t we assume that situation?

414
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,740
We are not our ego.

415
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,320
No, we are not.

416
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,220
We are the Spirit,the sublime, the great.

417
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,200
And that’s what I find.

418
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,980
Many new people coming, then they disappear, then they come after ten days,

419
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
then after they come after one month.

420
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
They have this problem, that problem.

421
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,260
Then why not grow?

422
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,180
When are we going to grow?

423
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,520
When are we going to become fully that?

424
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Time is very short, my children.

425
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,860
Time is very, very short. Believe me.

426
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,780
Some people advise me, “Mother, you have to be very strict and all that.”

427
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,420
I don’t know how a Mother could be strict.

428
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,060
What should I do? Because, you cannot force it on anyone.

429
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,420
The problem [I have / I’m helpless], is I cannot force it on to you

430
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,960
This is a big problem. You must understand this. You are seekers.

431
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,560
You are seekers of very great times, born in this great country of yours, but so much conditioned.

432
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,840
This is for you to take it within yourself, what you are, and to achieve that.

433
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
This is something cannot be forced.

434
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,420
I cannot mischievously do something or cleverly do something or cunningly say something to convince you.

435
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,080
It is not that. It is something that has to happen within you,

436
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,520
that you have to be something more than what you are.

437
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
It’s that concern of Mine

438
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,800
because it’s my job

439
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,120
that keeps me here.

440
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,400
You must know your real Self which is seeking,

441
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,320
which is seeking the truth.

442
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,600
It will never be satisfied with all these monkey tricks that people are indulging into.

443
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,940
It’s no monkey tricks.

444
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
You don’t become a monkey,

445
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
like dancing, jumping, singing.

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,360
This is not the thing.

447
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,260
In your awareness, in your central nervous system

448
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,700
you should feel the presence of your Spirit.

449
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,140
That’s it.

450
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,500
If you have discarded Christianity ?

451
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
like, some people write to me,

452
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,820
“Mother, I have many problems. First begins with Christianity” ?

453
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,120
where do you land?

454
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,860
Even if you discard Christianity you can’t do without Christ.

455
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,120
Christ is there. I mean, Christ is our soul. We cannot do without Him.

456
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Then you come into another thing,

457
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,440
then you fall into another trap, then fall into another trap.

458
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,240
You miss the essence of it every time you fall into these peripheries.

459
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,820
The essence is in the centre of it and that centre is within you; is your Spirit.

460
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,840
You may ask me a hundred questions, I will give you two hundred answers;

461
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,020
makes no difference at all, I tell you.

462
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,860
It is of no value,

463
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
of no availability

464
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,100
to you or any goodness out of it you, believe me.

465
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
You have to be what you are.

466
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,700
Unless and until that happens and you establish it within yourself,

467
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,420
it’s such a waste of life, waste of this Creation,

468
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,480
everything I feel wasted.

469
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,180
So I have to request you again and again.

470
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,380
Of course, in London now there are some very great Sahaja yogis, no doubt,

471
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,980
we have,

472
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,440
but the way it has been progressing if I were in any other country, I tell you,

473
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
things would have been very different.

474
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,440
I can assure you this one, any other country.

475
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,260
America? I’ve been there only once.

476
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,320
Can you believe it?

477
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Long time back, that too for about

478
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
four, five days, and this time when I went

479
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,620
I was hardly in any place for more than three days.

480
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,820
Say, Houston, hardly for three days and how many people there are.

481
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,460
I mean, you don’t know. Ask Gavin, he’ll tell you.

482
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,820
What’s wrong with us? Let’s see.

483
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I just can’t understand

484
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,380
why we can’t grow.

485
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,460
Why can’t we give up our conditionings easily and take to truth and get into it?

486
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:56,080
We don’t understand is it the importance of this time,

487
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,020
the vital nature of this happening.

488
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,300
Or have we lost that sense of seriousness

489
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,520
where an emergency of this kind has arisen today which we don’t feel or fathom?

490
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,840
Or we just think that it’s just a joke going on?

491
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,380
Or our life we treat is just like

492
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,580
a joke or a frivolous thing?

493
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,660
What is it?

494
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,940
I still can’t understand what stops that truth…

495
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,320
beyond me.

496
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,960
The land is fertile, beautiful.

497
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,200
I am not sown my seeds in a wrong land;

498
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,740
I know that.

499
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
But doesn’t grow; it doesn’t grow.

500
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,380
It doesn’t take shape.

501
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,880
What’s the matter?

502
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,040
Today there are new people, I am happy to know,

503
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
and I have to make a humble request to all of you.

504
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
If you have to come to Sahaja Yoga

505
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,340
you have to be people who have to understand that reality is not a joke.

506
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,840
It’s not a frivolous thing.

507
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,720
You have to become

508
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,960
a realised-soul

509
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,580
and you have to grow in the light of that Realisation and you have to master this art.

510
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
We need now masters all over.

511
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,040
Not that somebody else is your master but you become your own master.

512
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,360
Such people are needed to channelise the energy of God.

513
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,980
I am sure

514
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,100
Warren must have told you all about it.

515
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,620
He’s another great character I have;

516
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,060
very proud of him,

517
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,420
the way he feels responsible for the whole world,

518
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,700
the way he came down.

519
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,440
He sacrificed so much, so much.

520
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,220
I mean we, I don’t need any money from an, anything as such,

521
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,100
but even money-wise I am sure he must have done something.

522
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,820
I don’t know because I have never taken any money from him as such.

523
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,060
But even there I am sure,

524
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,060
he established an ashram, he established people, he got them, he worked it out.

525
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,380
I mean it’s remarkable, and how people followed him, seeing him the way he is.

526
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,800
He doesn’t have any private life left except for to enjoy this privacy of the Spirit with others,

527
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,140
and if you see his background

528
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,240
he’ll tell you that he knew he was a seeker

529
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,720
but in the seeking he committed so many mistakes, so many mistakes.

530
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
But look at his sensitivity.

531
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,420
He knows where the Kundalini is,

532
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,540
he knows how to correct it and not him but most of the people from Australia know it so well.

533
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,840
It’s nothing mundane.

534
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,780
It will be very sad

535
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,500
and unhappy if you people get your Realisation

536
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,340
and lose it and do not develop into it.

537
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,660
I don’t know what would be the category of such people

538
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,880
whom God has given the light and they didn’t give light to anyone.

539
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,640
I don’t know what should be the position.

540
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,260
Today I am rather concerned,

541
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,180
very much concerned because I have come back from these three countries.

542
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,060
I was amazed.

543
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,560
France: tremendous.

544
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,960
French people,

545
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,660
I used to always say that these “les miserables” and all that.

546
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,420
Nothing of the kind.

547
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,260
There’s a priest who got his Realisation.

548
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,940
He formed an association called “Saving the people from gurus.”

549
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,580
Very clever,

550
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,860
and he is a priest still,

551
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,600
but he is a Sahaja yogi out and out.

552
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,060
And what he does,  those people who go to him and tell against the Christianity

553
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
he said,“Why don’t you go to Sahaja Yoga?”

554
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,140
Anybody whom he saves, he sends them to Sahaja Yoga…

555
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,640
all that.

556
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But the other day he said, “Mother, why should we have Pope anymore?”

557
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,940
Look at that.

558
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,720
And he stays in the church and works for Sahaja Yoga.

559
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,200
Can you beat that?

560
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,540
Because he thinks he has to save people who are misled.

561
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,820
He does that.

562
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,820
We have people of that calibre.

563
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,140
Another one we met,

564
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
another one very great one,

565
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,180
in Portugal.

566
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,140
He told me that the T.M. gentleman wanted to establish his kingdom in Portugal.

567
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,440
He’s got a very big land and all that.

568
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,300
And he told me all the secrets.

569
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,840
He said, “I am going to talk to the people who are in charge here.

570
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,780
They are sensible.”

571
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,720
I said, “Really? Are you sure?”

572
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,380
I said, “If you want to talk to anybody here in Mentmore, they’ll not listen.. They are very satisfied

573
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,480
with the yards of black suits they are wearing

574
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,300
and with the so-called idea of sitting on a gold gilded chair.

575
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,960
All that stupidity.” He said, “No, not in Portugal. They are very sensible people.

576
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
They realise it. I am going to talk to them.”

577
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Because they are all suffering

578
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,760
so early. Only three years they have been doing it.

579
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,000
They are all suffering on the left side, their ears are finished, somebody’s eyes are finished,

580
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,560
somebody’s problem is on the left side, somebody has a problem on the left Void and all that.

581
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,620
I cured, of course.

582
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,900
But they said, “All of us are suffering.”

583
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,700
That means they are very sensitive also to suffer so fast.

584
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,840
And they are realising, they are reaching all of them, even their administrators and their;

585
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,880
everybody’s realising that there’s some sort of a nonsense going on in this T.M.

586
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,680
Just imagine.

587
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,480
When I went back,

588
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
so transformed and changed.

589
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,580
The one gentleman had an eye like this.

590
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,140
It’s all opened out equally the same, everything,face so transformed.

591
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,280
I said, “I can’t recognise you, the way you are changed.”

592
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Such a short time, in eight days,

593
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
they worked it out.

594
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,080
Portugal is a country known for its escape nowadays.

595
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,160
There are nobody, we should call,the real Portuguese

596
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,460
have run away from that country.

597
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,040
They are settled in Brazil.

598
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,220
Spain, people have not much hopes from Spain, politically.It’s a hopeless country, they say.

599
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,380
Italy is the worst of all. They have Mafia, this.

600
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
And in that Maya

601
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,080
these beautiful lotuses to see.

602
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
What a joy it was;

603
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,380
what a joy.

604
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,540
You can’t imagine.

605
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,580
Even our Ambassador in Spain said, “The people here are very different, Mother.”

606
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,260
He said, “I talked to some people. They said, ‘When She is coming you have to call us.’”

607
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,180
I said, “Next year you have a big program. This year let’s have only the Indians.

608
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
But next year, of course, you can call.”

609
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,720
You see, all of them here want to have Realisation.

610
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,380
All big people, eminent people.

611
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,760
You just come next year and you’ll see all of them.

612
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,400
Here, do you think anybody?

613
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,800
An ambassador, can you imagine?

614
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,540
I can’t think.

615
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,740
Very funny people.

616
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,100
I’ve met a very big man once in a dinner party

617
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,020
where one of the Sahaja yogis is the chairman of the Hague High Court, of course an Indian, Dr. Nagen Singh.

618
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
And he told that gentleman that,

619
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,580
“This lady is a very well-known spiritual leader of India and She has given Realisation to many

620
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,360
and She has given Realisation to me also.”

621
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,220
He looked at me and he said, “No, I am also a realised-soul.”

622
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,500
What to say?

623
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
He said, “Christ has given me Realisation.

624
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,580
It’s Christ who is going to give me.”

625
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,420
So Nagen Singh in Hindi says,“There are no vibrations,the Kundalini is frozen

626
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,280
and this one is saying. How can Christ give him Realisation?”

627
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,320
I said, “This is the escape because Christ is no more.”

628
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,440
Of course, Christ gives him but where is Christ within himself?

629
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
So he asked him, “Where is Christ within yourself?”

630
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
“That Christ knows himself.”

631
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,300
He said, “I didn’t know these people were such buffoons.”

632
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Really, these were his words.

633
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,140
And my husband then couldn’t bear it any more

634
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,200
He said “Now, forget it.” You see, he was such a blind man.

635
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,120
I mean, in India people may not get Realisation,

636
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,920
may not, but they know what is Realisation.

637
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,260
They know who is truthful,

638
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,320
I must say.

639
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,620
Whether they are ambassadors or Presidents, make no difference;

640
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,180
they know that definitely.

641
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,700
Even President of India, say,

642
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,140
if he sees me he doesn’t sit down.

643
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,860
He’ll stand up.

644
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,840
They have that sense.

645
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,020
That basic humility is missing.

646
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,280
That’s why we take to people who pamper our ego.

647
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
We take to people who are nonsensical.

648
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,980
We take to people who befool us.

649
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Only the egoistical can be befooled.

650
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,780
If you are not egoistical no one can befool you

651
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,860
How do you befool a person?

652
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,320
By pampering the ego.

653
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,580
So one has to understand

654
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,860
that unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves

655
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,080
we are not going to do very well in England.

656
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,420
It’s for all the Sahaja yogis as well as for people who have come here.

657
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,100
It’s a very, very, serious problem,

658
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:36,820
and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe that is this England, that’s the Heart.

659
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,620
And if you now any way escape your responsibility,

660
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,360
you will be held responsible,

661
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,860
I am telling you now very strongly.

662
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,940
Because today I had big lectures from people saying that,

663
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,980
“Mother, you don’t say things strongly, and people are to be frightened.”

664
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,840
I don’t want to frighten you but you will be held responsible,

665
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,780
take it from me.

666
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,540
You are born on this Earth,

667
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,100
on this

668
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,340
great land

669
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
for a very great purpose,

670
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,160
to create Jerusalem out of that.

671
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,160
And now if you are not going to stand up,

672
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
you’ll be held responsible.

673
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,700
This is what it is.

674
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
It’s a tremendous work one has to do,

675
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,340
for which you must prepare yourself

676
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,780
Get to it.

677
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,740
I can give Realisation;  that’s all.

678
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,980
But I can’t give you strength.

679
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,980
I mean, you can’t make the horse stand up on his forelegs, can you?

680
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,820
It’s a very, very, desperate situation sometimes the way things happen.

681
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,540
After all, you must know that My coming here has some meaning of.

682
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,140
I didn’t come here because

683
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,580
I chose to come in the way people,

684
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,820
the gurus walk into your country.

685
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,140
I came here because something was done spontaneously.

686
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,680
I had to stay here, I had to work for you,

687
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,540
I had to implore you and request you and tell you in every way possible your responsibility.

688
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,240
But then you don’t tell me because I have not failed in my duties as far as I’m concerned.

689
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,720
Of that I am very sure.

690
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
But now I’ll leave it to you

691
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,380
because I may not be here next year. What can you say?

692
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Depends on the moods.

693
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,420
But we have to see what you are going to do for the whole world,

694
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,720
for the whole emancipation of the human being.

695
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
First you have to find your own beauty

696
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,620
and you have to give this beauty to others.

697
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,100
This is a greatest artist’s job you have to do,

698
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,820
as a great master of art in divine life.

699
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,380
You have to become divine.

700
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,560
It’s you who has to become divine.

701
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,040
You don’t worry about me.

702
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,780
I don’t have to achieve anything.

703
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,240
That’s the only problem.

704
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,580
I don’t have to achieve it.

705
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I have to only achieve you people.

706
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:20,700
I have to only have ways and methods by which I could really make you grow.

707
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:30,740
All that is possible I will do, but you must stand up on your legs, must ask for it.

708
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,780
It’s a big problem.

709
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,760
Not for others; for me.

710
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,280
Because others have no such problem.

711
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,160
They don’t want you to stand on your legs.

712
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
They want you to crawl and they want you to disappear.

713
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,860
This is a different thing. I want you to grow,

714
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,160
not because I want, but Divine wants it.

715
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,040
The whole Creation wants it.

716
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,600
Otherwise it will have no meaning.

717
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,440
So the responsibility of English Sahaja yogis,

718
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,440
British Sahaja yogis is very great.

719
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,340
Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible,

720
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,420
that establish yourself.

721
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,740
You are lagging behind.

722
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,940
I can tell you Spanish people will have to come and teach you Sahaja Yoga.

723
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,760
Already we have got somebody from Australia to teach that.

724
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,980
You give up your old ideas and conditioning.

725
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,680
Every Saturday, Sunday, must you go out of the country, out of London?

726
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,300
London is your place where you have to work.

727
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,500
Unless and until you take it up upon yourself it’s not going to work out.

728
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,500
Some people have to do it, someone.

729
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,800
I am looking out for such people for whom this is their desire.

730
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,920
We talk of big things. If we talk to anyone, I see in big, big parties they talk,

731
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,940
“Oh, what’s this?” and “We must become peaceful countries.

732
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,800
We must do this and that must happen.”

733
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,720
And even if you’ll listen to the lecture of our great President of America,

734
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,380
you find, “Oh God, some angel is speaking,” or what?

735
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,200
Like an angel, they speak.

736
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,280
Angelic, prophetic, such big, big, words. I can’t understand even

737
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:32,320
it won’t come into the mouth of God Himself but the way people talk, ultimately what remains is nothing.

738
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
So let us be that, what we talk.

739
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,080
We can be.

740
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,300
We all can be. It’s very simple.

741
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,260
You have to decide.

742
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,000
You have to really decide. The time has come.

743
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,160
I just pray may God give you strength to stand with the truth.

744
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,380
It’s not difficult.

745
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,340
It’s very joy-giving. But stand with it, grow with it.

746
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,060
That’s what you are. Thank you very much.

747
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:18,500
Now if you have any questions you can ask me and we should have Realisation.

748
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,320
Hello.

749
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,040
What’s that? What’s that here?

750
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:39,200
Right Swadisthana. She’s showing right Swadisthana.

751
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,900
Oh, all right. Now you take this one.

752
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,820
They are fighting. They are fighting, see, working it out.

753
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,260
They are all fighting.

754
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,780
How is your child,[Graham]?

755
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,500
That same thing?

756
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,040
Much less.

757
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,720
Your Agnya? Have you brought her?

758
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,700
No, because I haven’t the right, because she has [just come out of / to stay in the] hospital two or three weeks.

759
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,060
“All right. On my way back if we have time I will go for see her.

760
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,700
That child is fighting.

761
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,500
What sufferings from the very beginning of life.

762
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,460
That house also I think has problems.

763
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:19,100
No questions? Are there any questions please?

764
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,080
Yes?

765
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:38,300
I’m from Holland and I wonder whether I should try to stay in England, in London for, should I remain in England to find work? ”

766
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,080
It’s difficult to find?

767
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:49,100
I am wondering whether I should try to find work here in England or, do you understand what I am saying?

768
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,240
You are English?

769
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,220
No, Holland.

770
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,840
Yes?

771
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,620
Holland.

772
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,380
Holland?

773
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,700
Yes.Oh, we need people in Holland.

774
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,060
I haven’t yet touched it.

775
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,160
Excuse me?

776
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I haven’t yet touched Holland.

777
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,800
Haven’t been there. I went there once, a long time back, but we have to touch Holland

778
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,680
There are lots of seekers, no doubt, but

779
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,220
drinking too much.

780
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:25,520
Yeah. They drink too much, they told me, like Scotland, see,

781
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,320
chana. All right, you eat chana

782
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,300
and we have to look after them, no doubt.

783
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,060
There are lots of seekers misled there are.

784
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,620
In Holland we have one great soul.

785
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,080
There’s a young boy of sixteen years, I think. Careen, his name is.

786
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
They asked him about his father, mother, everything.

787
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,800
He said, “my father is just like other fathers.”

788
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,820
I said, “Really? What does he do?”

789
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,440
“In the daytime he drinks beer. In the night he drinks whisky.”

790
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,940
I said, “Really?” “All fathers do that, Mother.”

791
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,680
“And what about the children?”

792
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,780
“Some of us, our friends, we meditate but most of them also are drinking beer.”

793
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,740
When he was twelve years he first came.

794
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,660
I think twelve or eight years he came here, I think.

795
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,740
Yes, and he must be sixteen now, yes.

796
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,400
Wonderful man. He is growing up there.

797
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,480
I told him to gather more people who think like him.

798
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,140
He might, he is a great person.

799
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,060
His mother is French and father is this thing and divorced and another mother,

800
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,320
all kinds of problems.

801
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,300
No, would be better in Holland, no doubt, but you get your Realisation,

802
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,900
you settle down here and we must start a centre in Holland and next year I am coming down there,

803
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,200
all right?

804
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,280
Holland is one place I have not been. I didn’t go to Austria.

805
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,100
Now, we have a very powerful yogi there. So I am going this year.

806
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,600
A few countries I have not tackled.

807
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,740
We should not go away from our country.

808
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,160
We should work there.

809
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,700
That’s the place we have to work, whatever is the condition.

810
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,260
Switzerland now are doing very well. Switzerland is doing so well.

811
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,340
Those who were committing suicide are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and doing very well.

812
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:16,260
I said, “The way you [are/were] doing suicide, if you can do Sahaja Yoga even once it will be all right.”

813
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,500
Because they did a perfect job always with their suicide things.

814
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,320
They used to plan it out so well, the suicide,

815
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,360
in such a way, I mean, that it would not create any problems for anyone and sort of thing.

816
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:38,600
They used to think about it all the time, how to commit suicide, and they, very great planning.

817
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,980
But look at Switzerland.

818
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,600
It’s a challenge to all of you.

819
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,300
So it’s a good idea.

820
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,940
You get your Sahaja Yoga here, settle down, master it and go to Holland.

821
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:06,700
You would be the one of the—- I gave once a Realisation to one Mr. called August Tigger.

822
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,400
He was the chairman of your, one of your very big companies.

823
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:18,460
He was a very big man, no doubt, but he told me that,

824
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,880
“I cannot talk about to anyone. They will think I have gone crazy.”

825
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,260
And he died.

826
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,380
He was a very old man when I met him.

827
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,620
He was about eighty years of age when I first met him.

828
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,300
And a very great seeker he was, very great seeker.

829
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,380
Holland I’ll definitely come, no doubt.

830
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,380
And now we have reached Brussels also.

831
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,280
So in Brussels and Holland we can do it, isn’t it?

832
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,300
From Brussels it is easier to go to Amsterdam.

833
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,060
Where will you be in Holland?

834
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,060
I have no place at all.

835
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,660
Huh.

836
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,660
have no place [where] to go for the moment.

837
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,540
But you will be placed in Holland?

838
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,700
Then I have to go back. I have to.

839
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,320
Yes, you should, you should.

840
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,080
You see, I would request you, once you become a Sahaja yogi, you should go there,

841
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
and we’ll send some people to help you also.

842
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,720
There is somebody very powerful in Brussels,

843
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,220
Very powerful in Brussels, who’ll help you, very powerful.

844
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,740
You remember that Rajneesh fellow who came?

845
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,200
Oh, he’s so powerful.

846
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,340
You must see that.

847
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,040
He’s brought about ten people from Brussels to Lille.

848
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,580
Can you imagine?

849
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,420
He’s already started his own centre.

850
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,480
It can only work in the democratic countries, isn’t it?

851
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,980
And I think Holland is very important.

852
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,900
And who is there is Dr Nagen Singh himself, is there in Holland.

853
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,140
He’s in Hague.

854
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,240
Is he?

855
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,780
