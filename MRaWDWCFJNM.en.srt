1
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,200
With love 

2
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:28,989
all kinds of creative action takes place.
You see how Raulbai has love for Me and in

3
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:39,090
this place you all also got new idea of creating
a beautiful thing. And as love will increase,

4
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,250
your creativity will develop.

5
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,250
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati,
is love. If there is no love there’s no

6
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,280
creativity. It’s even in the deeper sense,
you see. People who have created all the scientific

7
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,010
things are also out of love for the masses,
not for themselves. Nobody has produced anything

8
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,780
for themselves. If they make something for
themselves it has to become for universal

9
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,510
use, otherwise it has no meaning. Even if
you say atom bomb and all these things that

10
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,570
are created from science, they are also very
protective. If they had not created those,

11
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,289
people would not have taken out their minds
from war. Now, nobody can think of having

12
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:40,560
a big war. Of course, they are having cold
wars, but that also will gradually stop, when

13
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,409
they will be fed up.

14
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:48,680
So, all the activity on the right hand side,
of Saraswati, basically has to end up in love.

15
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,169
Starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever
does not end up in love coils up and finishes

16
00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:01,169
off. It just disappears. So you can see that
even matter, which is not used for love, just

17
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
finishes off. The basis has to be love. Otherwise
all such matter that we create which has angularity,

18
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,580
which is not fitting into the mass media which
is not appealing to the masses. Of course,

19
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,510
it takes time, you have seen that it takes
time - but it does have that tendency always

20
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,599
to disappear in the thin air as soon as you
find it does not appeal to the masses.

21
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:39,599
Now this love of, that we talk of, this great
love of God we talk of, we know it for definite

22
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,810
through vibrations. People do not have vibrations,
but still they can feel the vibrations in

23
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,349
a very unconscious way. All the great paintings
of the world have vibrations. All the great

24
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:01,510
creative works of the world have vibrations.
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained

25
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,940
by time, otherwise all other things are destroyed.
There must have been monuments and horrible

26
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,830
statues and horrible things that have been
created long time back. But they were all

27
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:19,830
destroyed by nature, and they could not stand
the impact of the Kala - that is the destructive

28
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:28,339
power of time. So, all that is sustaining,
all that is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

29
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:38,130
comes from this sense of love, which is within
us very much developed, but within others

30
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,990
also, who are not yet realized. Ultimately
the whole world has to realize that one has

31
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,140
to go to that ultimate love of God, otherwise
it has no meaning.

32
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,990
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods of appealing to people by

33
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,820
using cheap things and very vulgar things,
just to make people think that this is art.

34
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,820
But this will all disappear. It cannot sustain
the impact of the time as I told you, it cannot.

35
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,729
Because the time will kill it. All these things
have to disappear and already you can see

36
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:18,779
the result, how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West. So there is no need to be

37
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,450
so much disappointed with the West and to
say that the Western world is a wasteland.

38
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:30,589
It is going to be alright and it has to be
done. Especially it has done lot of Puja of

39
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,919
Saraswati, I should say, in the West. Much
more than they have done in India because

40
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,959
they have gone to learning and they have tried
to find out so many things. But only thing

41
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,529
they forgot that it is a Goddess, Goddess
of Learning. Everything comes from the Goddess.

42
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,170
That’s what they’ve forgotten. And that’'s
why all the problems have been created.

43
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,220
If there is no Spirit in your learning, if
there is no source of the Goddess in your

44
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,430
learning, then it is absolutely useless. If
they had realized that there is the Spirit

45
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:08,250
that is working it out, they would not have
gone that far. And that’s what I was warning

46
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:14,580
the Indians, all through, that you are now
taking to industrial revolution in a way and

47
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,870
to avoid all the complications of industrial
revolution, you must try to know the Spirit.

48
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,810
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have. Because

49
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,760
they are also human beings, you are also human
beings. You will also go the same way. At

50
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,950
random you will run and there will be problems,
the same problems as the Western people have.

51
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,589
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

52
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:48,589
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible to tell them even in

53
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:56,769
one lecture, even in ten lectures. But how
we go against Surya and how we go against

54
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,050
Saraswati, while doing the worship of Saraswati,
is to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

55
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:09,740
For example the Western people are very fond
of Surya because they have no Surya. But they

56
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,100
go too far with it, as you know, and create
complications within themselves of Surya.

57
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,100
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within, is the

58
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,860
light within. And if Surya chakra at the Agnya
level is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then

59
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,860
it is even more essential that the purity
of life, what we call ‘Niti’, is the morality

60
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,050
of life.

61
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,390
Now morality itself has become very much sort
of an argument in the West. People don't have

62
00:10:53,390 --> 00:11:00,390
any sense of absolute morality. On vibrations
of course you know. But they have gone all

63
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,550
against it. Those who are worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

64
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,050
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying

65
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:24,020
it. Because you cannot be a Surya if you do
not have a proper sense of morality and holiness.

66
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,710
The Surya itself brings light, to see everything
clearly.

67
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:38,630
So many qualities Surya has got. It dries
up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

68
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:45,630
It dries up all these places, which create
parasites. But so many parasites are created

69
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,490
in the West. Not only parasites, but there
are horrible cults and horrible things which

70
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,490
have come into those countries which are supposed
to be full of light, and in that darkness

71
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:08,970
they exist. Darkness about their Spirit, darkness
about their own knowledge and darkness about

72
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,190
love. These three things have taken over in
the places where you are supposed to love

73
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,120
light. Light doesn’t mean, light doesn’t
mean what you see with your gross eyes. Light

74
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,070
means from within - the Light of Love. That
one should understand – Light of Love. And

75
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:36,070
it is so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring, it’s

76
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,430
so abounding that unless and until you can
feel that light within you - that light which

77
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:51,430
is of pure love of purity, pure relationships,
pure understanding. If you can develop that

78
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:59,630
kind of a light within yourself, then the
whole thing will be cleansed. 'Wash me and

79
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,380
I shall be whiter than snow.' This is what
happens to you when you are completely cleansed.

80
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:18,380
The purest form of nature is within us. The
purest form of nature is within us. Our chakras

81
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,190
are made out of that purest form of nature.
We are the only people who are spoiling it

82
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,460
by our mental thinking, against the same Saraswati’s
power. You are going against Saraswati itself.

83
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling

84
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,040
all that. All our brain activity goes against
pure intelligence. And that’s what one has

85
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,670
to understand - that this pure intelligence,
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our thinking

86
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:05,690
can make us so bumptious, so ego-oriented,
so impure, that, we can really eat the poison

87
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,910
and say 'what is wrong with it'? Just the
opposite of Saraswati. If Saraswati is within

88
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:25,750
us, She gives us Subuddhi, wisdom. And that
is why to worship Saraswati, to worship Surya;

89
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,390
we must have that clear vision as to what
we have to be. What we are doing. What filth

90
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:37,779
we are living in. What our mind is getting
into. After all we are here for emancipation

91
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:43,160
and not for just for pampering our ego and
living with our filth that is with us. So

92
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,160
this light has come within us and we should
try to rise above our own mental filth, which

93
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,300
is being created around us.

94
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Apart from that, you have to go higher and
understand that there is, within us, a thing

95
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:10,560
called ego. And this ego is false, absolutely
false. You do not do anything. Actually when

96
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,850
you turn your eyes here and there, when your
attention is here and there it is nothing

97
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,850
but your ego that is trying to overpower you.
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood

98
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,660
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahatahamkara.

99
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,660
There is no really any ego that exists. It
is myth. It is a very big myth, because if

100
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:44,820
you start thinking you are doing everything
- you are doing this, you are doing that - which

101
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:51,320
you are not doing; then this nonsensical ego
comes in and you start working it out, it

102
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,060
can project in every direction. When it projects
forward, it overpowers others, it tries to

103
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:05,060
dominate others, tries to kill others, becomes
cruel. When it moves [to the] right side,

104
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:12,240
it becomes supraconscious. It starts seeing
things, which are absurd, which are foolish,

105
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,240
which are stupid. When it moves left side
then it starts talking - I mean, seeing things

106
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,860
- yourself as a big man, as a big Christ or
as a big Devi or something like Adi Gurus

107
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,850
and 'I am a very great personality' - that
is left sided. When it moves backwards, that

108
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,220
is the dangerous one.

109
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,220
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people. When their ego moves backwards

110
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,130
then they become gurus, they themselves have
lots of defects in themselves and they try

111
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:53,130
to pull people into those horrible stuff,
which is described as absolute Naraka. That’s

112
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,649
how, is the movement of ego on all the sides.

113
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:04,649
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi
that is, to talk about themselves, is the

114
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,380
worst of all. Whatever type of ego you may
have, if you start boasting about it and talking

115
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,380
about it, then it encircles, thickens the
walls of ego so much, that it is impossible

116
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,909
to penetrate into that. Because such a person
is completely satisfied with himself and he

117
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:29,840
believes that he is so. And once he starts
believing into a nonsense like that, it's

118
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,370
an impossibility, is an impossibility to penetrate.

119
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:40,370
So, when you boast about these things or you
talk big, be careful. You see, you know what

120
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,260
I am, but how many times do I say 'I am that'?
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations

121
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,580
for you. But how many times do I say so? At
the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

122
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:59,730
But I don't say that. If I say it loudly,
I don't know what may happen. The whole thing

123
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:06,730
might be blasted with that. So, one has to
understand that Mahatahamkara is the one that

124
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,320
acts, that works, that creates. Sometimes
I shout at you. Immediately all the bhoots

125
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,419
run away. Just once I shout. Yesterday, you
saw all the bhoots that were coughing, they

126
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,760
all ran away. Yesterday just I started. So
you should understand that now you are a realized

127
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,770
souls, you can also do the same. Use your
right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself, ‘‘Now

128
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,760
will you please stop boasting, will you stop
talking all this nonsense, will you stop showing

129
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,390
off!'' Then it will stop.

130
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,390
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active. Who want to do something

131
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,690
about it, not that they are not active. They
want to do it. But they know only one way,

132
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,690
is to act talkative. They don't understand
that there are inner ways by which you control

133
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:02,659
it much more. Because they don't want to take
to that, they take to this talking. And once

134
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,860
they take to talking and they talk about it,
the whole power goes. But if they do not talk

135
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,730
about it and keep it within themselves. It’s
alright, you can tell Me about your experiences

136
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,059
or anything, but if you start telling others,
and talking about it too much, then the powers

137
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:25,580
that you have got will all be disappearing
gradually. And you will just come down to

138
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,799
absolutely lowest level. So one should not
too much talk that “I have this power, I

139
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,730
have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,” which is a very wrong thing.

140
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,460
I warn you, don’t try to show off.

141
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:44,460
Yes, you can talk about My powers. It is all
right. But don't try to talk about your powers.

142
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,830
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

143
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:57,830
then you should say that “we”, not “I”.
“We” have, some of us have felt this power

144
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,369
within us. We have seen people”. It may
be you only, but you need not say, 'I' have.

145
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:08,929
What you have to say is 'We'. Then you become
the Mahatahamkara. When you say 'We', Yes

146
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:15,929
some of us', 'we do'. Like in Gregoire's book
also I made it, I saw to it, that he should

147
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:23,129
not have many 'I's', but he should have 'We'.
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole

148
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:28,499
collective being, the whole collective organism,
living organism of Sahaja Yogis. So if you

149
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:33,299
say, 'yes, some of us have got it', that means,
you put yourself down, but put all others

150
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,080
above you. Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know
some people have this.'

151
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,019
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego, you must

152
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:48,559
allow it to spread into everybody else. That’s
how you will make it perfectly all right.

153
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,190
Let it spread. “We, all Sahaja Yogis, we
all”.

154
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:56,190
But that pride is not there. I've seen that
pride is not there. Still it is very individualistic.

155
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,809
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens, that you become one personality,

156
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:04,419
one organization.

157
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:10,239
But the person will look down upon other people.
He will see that this person is low, that

158
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:16,299
person is higher, that person is there. But
he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis, how

159
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:23,070
beautiful we are. 'We' the body of Sahaja
Yoga, how beautiful we are. So always think

160
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:30,070
in the words of 'we', so your ego will become
much less, much less, much less. And the same

161
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:41,590
ego, which looked so funny and absurd, will
form tomorrow, the Ekadesha. Today’s, individual

162
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,830
ego will merge into Ekadesha. But we all must
remember to say 'we' all time.

163
00:21:54,509 --> 00:22:00,570
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change, because the sun has changed

164
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:07,299
its mood, now. Sun is coming this side. So
let us welcome the Sun, coming to the North

165
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:14,299
now, this way. And for Australians to say
that though the sun has gone, let us establish

166
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:21,739
the Sun, the domain of Sun, within ourselves.
Because Sun never disappears from our inside.

167
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:27,340
So that is how we have to take a mood by which
we should think of one personality, all of

168
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:34,139
us together, all of us together. And anybody
who tries to be something separate or different,

169
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:40,999
he will drop out. I will drop him out. Whatever
it may be, it will drop out. So you just don’t

170
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:44,369
worry yourself, anybody who tries to be singled
out or anything.

171
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:50,119
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture
the whole, to help the whole, to emancipate

172
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:57,119
the whole. But not to, in anyway, put anyone
down. Always. Because this is not the way

173
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:04,539
the Sahaja Yoga is. Sahaja Yoga only works
in collectivity. And the one who has developed

174
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:08,480
this permeating spirit, is a real Sahaja Yogi.
Who has not, is not!

175
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say. But this permeating personality,

176
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,580
which moves from places to places, whether,
you talk or not. Like your Mother is. Whether

177
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,629
I meet you or not, makes no difference, but
I am permeating through all of you, by little,

178
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:31,220
little things, also, I am there with you.
So like that, try to permeate into each other

179
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,369
and see the beauty. And you’ll enjoy yourself
the best because that is the biggest thing.

180
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:42,379
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.
Because this ego you know makes you like a

181
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:48,580
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport
with that beauty of permeation and just see

182
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,480
how the notes move into each other.

183
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,480
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

184
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:06,200
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust. And
one day I had written in childhood, a poem,

185
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,909
I remember. Very interesting poem it was - I
don't know where it is now - but which said

186
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:17,909
that I want to be like a dust particle which
moves with the wind. It goes everywhere. Can

187
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:25,509
go, sit on the head of a king, or can go and
fall at the feet of someone. And it can go

188
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:32,509
and sit on a little flower, and it can go
and sit everywhere. But I want to be a particle

189
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,359
of dust. That is fragrant, that is nourishing,
that is enlightening.

190
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,850
Like that, I had written a very beautiful
poem, I must have been about seven years of

191
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,869
age, I remember - 'To be a dust particle',
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

192
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:57,869
that I should be a dust particle. So that
I’ll permeate into people. Which is a very

193
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,739
big thing - to become a dust particle of that
kind. Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes

194
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,999
{sounds like ‘enwavened’ but I don’t
think that’s a word – “enlightened”??},

195
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:13,999
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

196
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,799
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming

197
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:28,279
a dust particle and today just while talking
to you, I remembered that I wanted to be that,

198
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,879
and that is what this place is.

199
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:37,049
And Raulbai is like that. She’s a very simple
woman, very simple woman, and she lives like

200
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:44,049
a very simple person but she has a sense of
permeation. And now there are so many Sahaja

201
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,200
Yogis, yesterday who came. I am sure that
they will take up, Sahaja Yoga, very well.

202
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:55,200
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia
now, and I am sure there are going to be more

203
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,879
people. I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them. Try to know them

204
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:04,859
who they are. They may not know English - so
get somebody to translate. Talk to them and

205
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:09,779
be nice to them, be friendly with them. I
wanted you to meet them for permeation. You

206
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,869
should know who are the people here, who are
in Nasik. Because somehow we never meet the

207
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:19,460
Sahaja Yogis, you see, who are in that particular
place, and when we go back we have only one

208
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,399
or two addresses. It is not a good idea. Try
to see how many people there are. Ask questions

209
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:27,029
about them, and all that.

210
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:32,789
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around, and this

211
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:38,649
is the way to overcome the problems of the
right side and that is how to worship Saraswati.

212
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:45,409
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

213
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:49,229
which She plays like music, and the smusic
penetrates into the heart. You don't know

214
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:55,889
how it goes into you and how it works out.
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja

215
00:26:55,889 --> 00:26:59,979
Yogi should permeate - like music into other
people.

216
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:04,059
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

217
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:11,059
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things. Like

218
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:20,389
the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.
Music will end up into melodies, like that

219
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,029
whatever She creates ends up into something
greater. Matter, whatever She produces, ends

220
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:34,489
up into aesthetics. If matter does not have
aesthetics then it is gross. Like that everything.

221
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:38,559
Now you will say what is water. Water becomes
the river Ganges.

222
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,559
These are the subtler things. So the matter
gets into subtler thing because it has to

223
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:53,869
permeate, it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is. And the best of all is the

224
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:01,210
air. That air becomes the vibrations.

225
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:08,479
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from 

226
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:24,289
this matter, from these five elements, becomes
that subtle thing. Of course, the left and

227
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:55,929
right side both work it out because the love
has to work on this and when love acts on

228
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:25,359
matter it becomes that, and 

229
00:29:53,619 --> 00:30:00,619
that is how one has 

230
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:33,539
to look at your own lives, to make it 

231
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:21,269
a beautiful combination of 

232
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:19,410
love and matter.

233
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:46,569
May 

234
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:50,329
God bless you!
