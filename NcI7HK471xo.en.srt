Evening program, Avignon, France, 07-07-1990

2
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:09,205
Give her a chair

3
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:16,455
 

4
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:18,455
 

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,400
Give her a chair

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,020
otherwise she won't be able to play harmonium.

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,820
 

8
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:43,995
 

9
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:45,315
 

10
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:06,395
 

11
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
 

12
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Ah,

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,380
[Hindi]

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,920
[Hindi]

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,520
Can you keep it up there? Ah. On that.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
[Hindi]

17
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,140
[Hindi]

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
[Hindi]

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,060
[Hindi]

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,580
You can move that.

21
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
 

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,780
Come on. Have a sit there.

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,520
 

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,560
We would like to present you a "Bharood" [Marathi religious song]

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,860
by Sant Eknath

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,060
It's a song that

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,880
in a style that

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
is designed

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
to teach people

31
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,800
what will happen to them if they don't behave in a

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,700
in the correct way

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,220
In this particular song

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,580
Sant Eknath is talking about

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,800
 

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,340
what happens to people if they're not, if they trick people

37
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,220
badly

38
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,955
if they are rude to them, if they cheat them.

39
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:26,515
Sant Eknath gives example in particular

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,540
of Duryodhana

41
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,965
who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court.

42
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,460
 

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,480
and it was eventually

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,765
his brother, the brother of Duryodhana

45
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:42,075
drag Draupadi into the court to be humiliated.

46
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:45,415
And was eventually punished by Bhishma

47
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:51,045
punished by Bhishma in a dual.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,380
In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita

49
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,780
was duly punished by Shri Rama.

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,900
And so on in many cases.

51
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,700
In reality, there are only four

52
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,800
people, that Sant Eknath mentions

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,340
who are free from any kind of

54
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,060
problem in his regard.

55
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,980
For example, Bhishma

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,380
and

57
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,285
Hanumana, those two are examples.

58
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,835
Sant Eknath concludes the song

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,585
inviting us to be

60
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:35,880
sweet with each other and not to abuse each other.

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Otherwise - cause if we do,

62
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:39,275
then our fate

63
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:42,285
is a very ugly one.

64
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,600
Give me a microphone for tablas.

65
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,340
 

66
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,720
When standing, they will wait.

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,360
Yes.

68
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
 

69
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,760
So, all of you can sit there like this only.

70
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Patrick!

71
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,800
Yes.

72
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,340
 

73
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:32,725
 

74
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,155
 

75
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:36,865
 

76
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,575
 

77
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:50,925
 

78
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,725
 

79
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,565
 

80
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,035
 

81
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:01,885
 

82
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,135
 

83
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:04,975
 

84
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,245
 

85
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,495
 

86
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,745
 

87
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,085
 

88
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:45,555
 

89
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:53,975
 

90
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:55,805
 

91
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:58,455
 

92
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,225
 

93
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,305
 

94
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,645
 

95
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,145
 

96
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,205
 

97
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:49,825
 

98
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:54,265
 

99
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:57,385
 

100
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,415
 

101
00:09:00,135 --> 00:09:01,945
 

102
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:28,025
 

103
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:29,875
 

104
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,925
 

105
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:41,355
 

106
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:43,605
 

107
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:47,865
 

108
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,345
 

109
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:52,645
 

110
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,505
 

111
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:20,085
 

112
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,405
 

113
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,965
 

114
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:29,305
 

115
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,625
 

116
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:36,655
 

117
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,315
 

118
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,555
 

119
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,695
 

120
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:46,885
 

121
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:49,765
 

122
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:24,325
 

123
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:27,075
 

124
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,195
 

125
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:33,135
 

126
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:36,465
 

127
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:38,835
 

128
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,905
 

129
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,345
 

130
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,185
 

131
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,355
 

132
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:24,805
We have another

133
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,525
song for you. This time it's a

134
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,455
village's song, a folk's song

135
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,200
from Uttar Pradesh.

136
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,155
The context of the song is

137
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,080
a group of villagers on a way to a festival at Prayag

138
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,020
in the month of Magha which is January or February.

139
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,520
 

140
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,060
And Prayag is a place where the two holy rivers of India, Ganga and Yamuna, meet.

141
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,340
So, in the first verse, the villagers are singing the praises of Prayag

142
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,740
where the rivers meet,

143
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,820
and for this reason, it's a holy place,

144
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,440
a place of pilgrimage.

145
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,600
In the second verse, they explain how Ganga comes from Haridwar

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,060
which is also a place of pilgrimage because Ganga has come down from the heaven in that place.

147
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,160
So it has come from Haridwar,

148
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,460
which is a popular place of pilgrimage,

149
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,520
to Prayag which is also a place of pilgrimage.

150
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:52,915
 

151
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:53,975
 

152
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:54,975
 

153
00:14:57,525 --> 00:14:59,125
 

154
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,325
 

155
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:05,715
 

156
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:11,225
 

157
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,155
 

158
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:13,155
 

159
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,465
 

160
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:21,655
 

161
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:28,985
 

162
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,855
 

163
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,740
 

164
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,880
Come here, on the same line. You go a little bit that side.

165
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,020
 

166
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,555
 

167
00:17:20,475 --> 00:17:21,475
 

168
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,745
 

169
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,165
 

170
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:33,145
 

171
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,365
 

172
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:54,815
 

173
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
 

174
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,780
Ok, very good.

175
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
 

176
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:44,025
 

177
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:48,555
 

178
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:49,555
 

179
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:50,985
 

180
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:55,385
 

181
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,420
Ah! This reminded me of my own marriage when I went to my

182
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,840
husband's house.

183
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,620
They all used to sing like this only there.

184
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,300
So, it's wonderful, the way they have sung it, absolutely with  complete pronunciation,

185
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,720
everything, it's wonderful.

186
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,460
I was just enjoying it. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have enjoyed too.

187
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
 

188
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:57,975
 

189
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,185
 

190
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:04,485
 

191
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:12,975
 

192
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:13,975
 

193
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,845
 

194
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,165
 

195
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:26,815
 

196
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,105
 

197
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,620
 

198
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,560
The group of students who are sitting in front of you, on the stage,

199
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,500
have been learning classical music

200
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,160
at Garlate house near Milano, I hope you - all of you know

201
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,220
Garlate house.

202
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,100
And they covered about seven ragas.

203
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,180
Among these ragas, they learnt Marva rag

204
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,000
which is the favorite raga of Shri Mataji.

205
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:13,880
And they will sing what we call the chutta khayal [composition] in ektaal [12 beats].

206
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,920
First, they will sing the aroha [ascending scale]

207
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:20,445
and pakad [melodic theme] of raga Marva

208
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,200
and then sargam [singing notes].

209
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,780
Aroha is ascend

210
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,200
Aroha is, are the ascending notes of the raga

211
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,920
And Avaroha are the descending notes of the raga.

212
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,760
And pakad are the group of notes typical of that raga,

213
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,660
so that the raga can be recognized when those notes are sung.

214
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,440
And they are singing the chutta khayal in ektaal.

215
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,720
And before singing the chutta khayal,

216
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
they will sing sargam.

217
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,340
Sargam, they will sing also in double rhythm.

218
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,620
And chutta khayal, they will sing with alap and taans [first and second part of the raga].

219
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,700
I hope all of you will like it and Shri Mataji will also like what they sing in the present.

220

379
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,240
Is a prayer composed by Guru Dev Rabindranath Tagore

380
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,220
in raga Bhairavi.

381
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,240
"Antara Mama Bikoshito Karo, antara tara hey"

382
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,860
The devotee is praying to the God that: "Let my inner being be enlightened."

383
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,920
"Nirmala karo, ujjwala karo, sundara karo hey."

384
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,000
Nirmala, you know: Shri Mataji's name is Nirmala, pure.

385
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,380
Absolutely pure.

386
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,760
And "Mangalo karo" "make it holy and make it beautiful".

387
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,240
So, this prayer is being sung

388
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,545
by the students who were studying semi-classical

389
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,635
in raga Bhairavi and this will be the last song.

390
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,575
 

391
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:14,635
 

392
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:16,415

00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:06,995
 

418
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,145
 

419
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,725
 

420
00:38:17,455 --> 00:38:19,605
 

421
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,805
 

422
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,245
 

423
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,055
 

424
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,485
 

425
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:35,695
 

426
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:36,895
 

427
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,175
 

428
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,635
 

429
00:38:44,585 --> 00:38:45,585
 

430
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:52,405
 

431
00:38:53,795 --> 00:38:55,645
 

432
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:59,225
 

433
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:05,145
 

434
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,145
 

435
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:07,755
 

436
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:08,905
 

437
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,025
 

438
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,585
 

439
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,195
 

440
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:20,415
 

441
00:39:21,595 --> 00:39:23,735
 

442
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,725
 

443
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,655
 

444
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:32,405
 

445
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:35,165
 

446
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:37,205
 

447
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:38,825
 

448
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:40,915
 

449
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:42,155
 

450
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:44,595
 

451
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:46,705
 

452
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,415
 

453
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:55,995
 

454
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:57,405
 

455
00:39:58,215 --> 00:39:59,215
 

456
00:40:02,015 --> 00:40:03,015
 

457
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:06,805
 

458
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,965
 

459
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:11,955
 

460
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:15,615
 

461
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:17,175
 

462
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:19,075
 

463
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,495
 

464
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:24,695
 

465
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:29,025
 

466
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:32,135
 

467
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,355
 

468
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,405
 

469
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:38,445
 

470
00:40:38,525 --> 00:40:41,325
 

471
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:43,355
 

472
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:44,715
 

473
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,375
 

474
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:47,835
 

475
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:52,985
 

476
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,095
 

477
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:58,335
 

478
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:01,245
 

479
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:02,475
 

480
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:05,775
 

481
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:07,095
 

482
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:10,125
 

483
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,265
 

484
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:15,285
 

485
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,505
 

486
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,155
 

487
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:26,445
 

488
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,455
 

489
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:32,875
 

490
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,225
 

491
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,405
 

492
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,025
 

493
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:41,805
 

494
00:42:06,195 --> 00:42:07,285
 

495
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
 

496
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,460
In a bus and

497
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,440
we had a lot of discomfort

498
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,420
in the sense that we were not feeling free.

499
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,920
But when we came into this wonderful land of Italy,

500
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,020
we were feeling very, very free and we were also feeling very hungry.

501
00:42:45,225 --> 00:42:46,225
 

502
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,100
Maybe, it has to do something with the Nabhi, I'm sure.

503
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,020
But then, in order to keep my "Sangeet Sarita" members happy,

504
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,400
I was trying to sing a raga which is known as Chandrakauns.

505
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,160
It's a very, very dynamic raga.

506
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,600
And close to that raga is another raga known as Malkauns.

507
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,800
And there is a difference of only one note in these two ragas.

508
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,440
And, as I was singing I was talking to Guruji and I was saying

509
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,900
that if we add this note of one raga into another,

510
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:28,675
I think we will create a beautiful raga.

511
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,200
And he immediately got up and he started singing

512
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,360
with that additional note and a new raga was born.

513
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,420
Just, just in the bus, a new raga was born.

514
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,560
And then,

515
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,880
we had to give a name and Guruji gave a very, very dynamic very sahaj name:

516
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,480
he called it "Chaitanya Ranjani" [vibrations; to be rejoiced]

517
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,940
which will entertain your Chaitanya.

518
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,240
This is a raga which is going to be played for the first time.

519
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:08,160
Even in India, my sister will bear me out that this has not been played before, anywhere.

520
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,940
So, you can imagine what's a headache is done to this poor Babamama

521
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,960
who knew very little about music.

522
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,900
He's gone so dynamic that he is creating ragas!

523
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,300
 

524
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,060
This will be played to you by one and only Guruji on the violin

525
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,340
and our young artist Nasir khan.

526
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:40,785
 

527
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:44,235
 

528
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:49,175
 

529
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
 

530
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,240
Guido, could you please take down completely ...

531
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,580
as it is obstructing the view.

532
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,220
It has to be removed completely.

533
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,195
 

534
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,580
 

535
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,340
I was discussing this raga with my

536
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,380
other sister; where is she? I can't see.

537
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,660
She must be sitting on side.

538
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,580
So, she was saying as to: "How could you create this raga?"

539
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,820
 

540
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,040
And she herself replied: "It is because of your concentration in music."

541
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,020
"That,

542
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,140
that is because you put your heart and soul in something and you will achieve."

543
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,900
So, when you have to have creativity,

544
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,200
your attention is the most important equipment.

545
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,140
So, you put your attention on something and you are bound to create

546
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,140
if your attention is fully on that subject.

547
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Out of the twelve brothers and sisters that we are,

548
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,360
my dear sister is a subtle artist and was blessed with this voice and the gift of music

549
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,700
and we used to have music every day in the house.

550
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,040
I was a very playful boy, but in between, I used to go and listen to this music.

551
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,360
And that has been registered with me and it is coming so helpful now

552
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,200
so that we can transfer this culture of India through this music

553
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,355
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

554
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,080
It's a tremendous feeling.

555
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,780
Now, I will first tell you as to what the two ragas are

556
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,800
and then I will tell you how they have been blended.

557
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,740
So you will be able to appreciate the difference.

558
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,980
 

559
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:25,845
 

560
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:27,745
 

561
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:29,065
 

562
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:34,745
 

563
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:37,665
 

564
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:38,665
 

565
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:40,755
 

566
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:43,945
 

567
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:47,805
 

568
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
 

569
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,560
First, a very brief introduction of the members of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita who are on the stage:

570
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,300
Sandesh Popatkar on the tabla.

571
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,220
Then,

572
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,280
Then our Guruji mister Prabhakarji [Dhakde] on the violin.

573
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,000
And, two years ago this young artist Nasir Khan was here, he was then the baby

574
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,600
of the team.

575
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,080
He has lost that status of being a baby because he's become,

576
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,700
he is going to become a father very shortly.

577
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,980
And- but his sitar has improved immensely

578
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,480
over the two years.

579
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:10,220
And now I will ask Prabhakarji to first play the ragas as they are.

580
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,060
The two ragas.

581
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,980
Now, first, he will play the Chandrakauns.

582
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
 

583
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,600
One minute, the tuning.

584
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,260
 

585
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,185
 

586
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:36,645
 

587
00:49:36,645 --> 00:49:37,645
 

588
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:40,515
 

589
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:45,945
 

590
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:51,005
 

591
00:50:13,835 --> 00:50:15,155
 

592
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:21,665
 

593
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,240
 

594
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,580
Now, this is Chandrakauns he is playing.

595
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,040
 

596
00:50:41,055 --> 00:50:42,055
 

597
00:50:44,185 --> 00:50:46,025
 

598
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:52,545
 

599
00:50:57,615 --> 00:50:58,615
 

600
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:00,445
 

601
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,345
 

602
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:18,685
 

603
00:51:20,025 --> 00:51:21,025
 

604
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:23,885
 

605
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
 

606
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,800
Now, this is the original raga, Chandrakauns.

607
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,200
Pakad notation [unsure]

608
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,935
 

609
00:51:39,935 --> 00:51:42,905
 

610
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:44,815
 

611
00:51:45,605 --> 00:51:47,425
 

612
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,540
 

613
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,200
Acha [Hindi]. Now, I'll ask Nasir to play Malkauns.

1052
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:15,525
 

1053
01:26:15,525 --> 01:26:18,725
 

1054
01:26:19,155 --> 01:26:22,445
 

1055
01:26:22,445 --> 01:26:25,655
 

1056
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:28,995
 

1057
01:26:29,955 --> 01:26:30,955
 

1058
01:26:31,605 --> 01:26:34,725
 

1059
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:35,985
 

1060
01:26:36,635 --> 01:26:37,635
 

1061
01:26:38,115 --> 01:26:39,655
 

1062
01:26:50,525 --> 01:26:51,525
 

1063
01:27:01,315 --> 01:27:02,315
 

1064
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:04,045
 

1065
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:24,865
 

1066
01:27:28,505 --> 01:27:29,505
 

1067
01:27:37,765 --> 01:27:38,765
 

1068
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:55,395
 

1069
01:28:04,295 --> 01:28:05,795
 

1070
01:28:17,495 --> 01:28:18,675
 

1071
01:28:19,115 --> 01:28:20,115
 

1072
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:22,755
 

1073
01:28:23,015 --> 01:28:24,015
 

1074
01:28:46,545 --> 01:28:47,695
 

1075
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:49,625
 

1076
01:28:50,815 --> 01:28:51,815
 

1077
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:54,575
 

1078
01:28:55,165 --> 01:28:56,165
 

1079
01:28:57,755 --> 01:28:58,755
 

1080
01:29:00,755 --> 01:29:01,755
 

1081
01:29:03,955 --> 01:29:04,955
 

1082
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:10,245
 

1083
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:11,435
 

1084
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:12,435
 

1085
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:24,775
 

1086
01:29:25,595 --> 01:29:26,595
 

1087
01:29:27,385 --> 01:29:28,385
 

1088
01:29:30,165 --> 01:29:31,235
 

1089
01:29:32,755 --> 01:29:33,755
 

1090
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:35,335
 

1091
01:29:36,435 --> 01:29:37,435
 

1092
01:29:41,565 --> 01:29:42,815
 

1093
01:29:43,985 --> 01:29:44,985
 

1094
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:49,875
 

1095
01:29:51,725 --> 01:29:52,705
 

1096
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:53,705
 

1097
01:30:34,195 --> 01:30:35,195
 

1098
01:30:41,105 --> 01:30:42,105
 

1099
01:30:42,975 --> 01:30:43,975
 

1100
01:30:45,445 --> 01:30:46,445
 

1101
01:30:55,735 --> 01:30:58,055
 

1102
01:30:58,715 --> 01:30:59,755
 

1103
01:31:00,095 --> 01:31:00,965
 

1104
01:31:00,965 --> 01:31:03,355
 

1105
01:31:19,595 --> 01:31:20,595
 

1106
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,120
 

1107
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:03,460
Shri Mataji has suggested

1108
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,360
a new name for this raga.

1109
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:10,320
Since this is a gift from the disciple to the guru,

1110
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:15,800
and guru is synonymous of Purnima that is the full Moon,

1111
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:19,960
Shri Mataji says that this raga should be called

1112
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,820
"Chaitanya Purnima", that means-

1113
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,280
I think this is the biggest award

1114
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,035
a disciple can expect from a guru

1115
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,940
that She has blessed this raga with a very wonderful name.

1116
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,480
Jai Shri Mataji.

1117
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:11,140
 

1118
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:15,375
 

1119
01:34:45,145 --> 01:34:46,145
 

1120
01:34:47,555 --> 01:34:48,555
 

1121
01:35:08,945 --> 01:35:09,945
 

1122
01:35:12,865 --> 01:35:13,865
 

1123
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:27,025
 

1124
01:35:34,235 --> 01:35:35,575
 

1125
01:35:37,295 --> 01:35:38,295
 

1126
01:35:39,325 --> 01:35:40,325
 

1127
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,735
 

1128
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:43,695
 

1129
01:35:43,695 --> 01:35:44,695
 

1130
01:35:52,985 --> 01:35:55,015
 

1131
01:35:58,745 --> 01:35:59,875
 

1132
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,725
 

1133
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:14,705
 

1134
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:18,900
 

1135
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:22,780
You are lucky because Shri Mataji is speaking about you.

1136
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,180
All of you.

1137
01:36:33,545 --> 01:36:36,225
 

1138
01:36:45,385 --> 01:36:46,665
 

1139
01:36:50,985 --> 01:36:51,985
 

1140
01:36:55,325 --> 01:36:56,325
 

1141
01:36:58,255 --> 01:36:59,255
 

1142
01:37:00,605 --> 01:37:01,605
 

1143
01:37:02,145 --> 01:37:04,465
 

1144
01:37:04,505 --> 01:37:05,785
 

1145
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:07,945
 

1146
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:11,585
 

1147
01:37:11,695 --> 01:37:13,045
 

1148
01:37:13,635 --> 01:37:16,595
 

1149
01:37:16,595 --> 01:37:18,905
 

1150
01:37:18,905 --> 01:37:21,845
 

1151
01:37:21,845 --> 01:37:24,615
 

1152
01:37:24,615 --> 01:37:25,615
 

1153
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:30,345
 

1154
01:37:42,635 --> 01:37:43,635
 

1155
01:37:45,195 --> 01:37:46,195
 

1156
01:37:46,585 --> 01:37:47,585
 

1157
01:37:56,625 --> 01:37:58,045
 

1158
01:38:00,015 --> 01:38:01,015
 

1159
01:38:07,135 --> 01:38:08,135
 

1160
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:10,205
 

1161
01:38:15,565 --> 01:38:16,605
 

1162
01:38:18,015 --> 01:38:19,015
 

1163
01:38:19,505 --> 01:38:20,505
 

1164
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:29,175
 

1165
01:38:29,575 --> 01:38:30,575
 

1166
01:38:31,175 --> 01:38:32,175
 

1167
01:38:34,265 --> 01:38:35,265
 

1168
01:38:36,925 --> 01:38:37,925
 

1169
01:38:44,535 --> 01:38:45,535
 

1170
01:38:47,145 --> 01:38:48,755
 

1171
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:53,260
 

1172
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,200
Chers amis, [Dear friends,]

1173
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,180
bonsoir. [good night.]

1174
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,560
Thank you.

1175
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,560
[No sound.]

1176
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:24,840
Because I wanted to drive in Rome, I wanted to drive, so I said:

1177
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,860
"We will take the car."

1178
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,860
So we took the car

1179
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:34,640
and as you know that it's very difficult to find parking in Rome,

1180
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,180
like in Paris, yes.

1181
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,260
More difficult.

1182
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:45,980
So, for about twenty minutes,

1183
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,200
we went around, around and around

1184
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,940
looking for a parking place.

1185
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:01,120
Twenty minutes later, I suddenly noticed

1186
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:07,480
a small gap in front of the restaurant.

1187
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,380
I took my car and I went into this gap.

1188
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,520
And in front,

1189
01:41:15,595 --> 01:41:19,055
there was a poster of Shri Mataji smiling.

1190
01:41:36,345 --> 01:41:37,345
 

1191
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:39,900
 

1192
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:44,840
The smile on that poster was very knowing.

1193
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,480
I'm very-

1194
01:41:53,455 --> 01:41:56,915
I'm very touched and very moved

1195
01:41:57,195 --> 01:41:58,875
that

1196
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,560
we have been chosen as one of the musicians

1197
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,660
to play in this

1198
01:42:09,235 --> 01:42:11,215
elated evening.

1199
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:15,600
 

1200
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:22,500
Indian classical music is based on ragas,

1201
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,180
melodies which we call ragas,

1202
01:42:27,185 --> 01:42:30,025
and ragas are emotions,

1203
01:42:30,485 --> 01:42:33,945
ragas are mood, it's an emotion.

1204
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:38,600
And different ragas have different emotions.

1205
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,720
And this evening, I chose to play a raga

1206
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:48,840
called Puriya, raga Puriya.

1207
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,840
[No sound.]

1208
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,240
 

1209
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,360
Tomorrow is, as you know, we are going to celebrate the Guru Purnima.

1210
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:33,100
And all these artists, whom you see here,

1211
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,840
have become such great artists

1212
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,240
because of their dedication - of course through the art- but through their gurus.

1213
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:42,860
Complete dedication.

1214
01:43:43,255 --> 01:43:46,695
And this is the key of their success:

1215
01:43:47,145 --> 01:43:50,465
complete dedication to the guru.

1216
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,140
And to master any art,

1217
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:59,220
you have to have dedication and surrendering.

1218
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:05,280
And that's how these people have achieved such heights of perfection.

1219
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:08,940
That they have followed their gurus

1220
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:12,480
out and out absolutely, completely surrendering.

1221
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:17,380
And that is why today I'm happy that we have so many artists here, especially

1222
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:20,840
such a great artist

1223
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:23,220
of such fame before you.

1224
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,540
But if you ask him, he 'll tell you that

1225
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:29,900
he had to go through penance

1226
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,560
to master this art.

1227
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,100
And his own father is his guru.

1228
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:38,380
So what a difficult situation must be for the father or for the son.

1229
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,495
But as far as the art is concerned,

1230
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,240
there is no compromise.

1231
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,760
In the same way, as fas as spirituality is concerned,

1232
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,080
there is no compromise.

1233
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,980
Maybe, your guru is your Mother, but still,

1234
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,360
no compromise.

1235
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:55,300
So, may God bless you.

1236
01:45:15,765 --> 01:45:16,765
 

1237
01:45:25,895 --> 01:45:26,895
 

1238
01:45:45,785 --> 01:45:46,785
 

1239
01:46:19,645 --> 01:46:20,645
 

1240
01:46:22,165 --> 01:46:23,165
 

1241
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:27,135
 

1242
01:46:27,135 --> 01:46:29,325
 

1243
01:46:30,815 --> 01:46:34,135
 

1244
01:46:34,135 --> 01:46:35,695
 

1245
01:46:37,615 --> 01:46:38,615
 

1246
01:46:38,795 --> 01:46:39,795
 

1247
01:46:40,565 --> 01:46:42,125
 

1248
01:46:45,255 --> 01:46:46,255
 

1249
01:46:56,135 --> 01:46:57,365
 

1250

2372
03:27:51,065 --> 03:27:52,065
 

2373
03:27:54,255 --> 03:27:55,255
 

2374
03:28:25,055 --> 03:28:26,055
 

2375
03:28:34,605 --> 03:28:35,605

2377
03:29:44,405 --> 03:29:45,405
 

2378
03:29:47,805 --> 03:29:48,805
 

2379
03:29:50,605 --> 03:29:51,605
 

2380
03:29:53,785 --> 03:29:55,225
 

2381
03:29:59,505 --> 03:30:00,505
 

2382
03:30:04,805 --> 03:30:05,805
 

2383
03:30:09,565 --> 03:30:10,565
 

2384
03:30:12,025 --> 03:30:13,605
 

2385
03:30:15,845 --> 03:30:16,845
 

2386
03:30:21,545 --> 03:30:22,805
 

2387
03:30:24,745 --> 03:30:26,375
 

2388
03:30:28,495 --> 03:30:29,495
 

2389
03:30:38,565 --> 03:30:39,565
 

2390
03:30:45,935 --> 03:30:46,935
 

2391
03:30:57,945 --> 03:30:58,945
 

2392
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:09,880
 

2393
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:28,780
Thank you very much for appreciating him so much.

2394
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:30,875
Actually,

2395
03:33:30,880 --> 03:33:32,080
 

2396
03:33:32,980 --> 03:33:36,200
it is a tremendous speed, you see

2397
03:33:36,200 --> 03:33:38,715
the speed with which and the balance.

2398
03:33:38,715 --> 03:33:41,435
Balance and the speed.

2399
03:33:41,440 --> 03:33:45,400
We are living in an age of, we are living in an age of a jet, you see,

2400
03:33:45,500 --> 03:33:47,960
we're living in an age of speed

2401
03:33:48,040 --> 03:33:52,300
and in that speed, we have to keep the balance and the rhythm.

2402
03:33:52,780 --> 03:33:55,215
That's what you have to learn

2403
03:33:55,220 --> 03:33:59,640
is to keep the balance and the rhythm and then you have to come to the first beat,

2404
03:33:59,880 --> 03:34:01,800
that is the Spirit.

2405
03:34:02,220 --> 03:34:07,040
So, how you are bound, may go anywhere with any speed,

2406
03:34:07,820 --> 03:34:10,120
keep the speed, keep the balance

2407
03:34:10,240 --> 03:34:13,020
and come back to the same

2408
03:34:13,340 --> 03:34:17,800
first beat which is the Spirit,

2409
03:34:17,920 --> 03:34:20,000
is the- that's how it works out.

2410
03:34:22,180 --> 03:34:25,660
And the speed with which he is playing, I tell you, this is a

2411
03:34:27,540 --> 03:34:30,660
very great, modern also, a kind of a blessing

2412
03:34:30,920 --> 03:34:33,280
that there is a speed in the atmosphere.

2413
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:36,115
And everywhere there's speed and -

2414
03:34:36,120 --> 03:34:39,520
but in that speed to have the balance is only possible

2415
03:34:40,140 --> 03:34:40,960
when

2416
03:34:41,445 --> 03:34:44,055
you practice what you call "riyaz"

2417
03:34:44,055 --> 03:34:47,185
is quite deep and you do it with your

2418
03:34:47,315 --> 03:34:49,815
whole attention and whole heart.

2419
03:34:49,820 --> 03:34:50,840
Then only,

2420
03:34:51,240 --> 03:34:54,120
otherwise it's not possible such a speed that he has.

2421
03:34:54,340 --> 03:34:57,695
What a tremendous speed! [Hindi]

2422
03:34:57,700 --> 03:35:00,380
 

2423
03:35:00,820 --> 03:35:05,380
Speed [inaudible] - you see,  have you noticed the speed with which he was playing?

2424
03:35:05,380 --> 03:35:07,380
And have you noticed the balance that he had?

2425
03:35:07,385 --> 03:35:09,280
And how he was rhythmic?

2426
03:35:09,395 --> 03:35:12,135
Rhythm, he never missed, you see, he's very  good

2427
03:35:12,220 --> 03:35:15,340
as we call it the [inaudible]

2428
03:35:15,640 --> 03:35:18,100
like.

2429
03:35:18,260 --> 03:35:19,840
 

2430
03:35:20,200 --> 03:35:22,400
So he is, tablavala is another -

2431
03:35:22,400 --> 03:35:23,340
Tablavala is very sahaj Mother.

2432
03:35:23,340 --> 03:35:24,120
Sahaj!

2433
03:35:24,120 --> 03:35:25,800
And he is absolutely relaxed

2434
03:35:25,800 --> 03:35:27,860
and he is playing so well. He's beautiful.

2435
03:35:28,740 --> 03:35:33,100
And that is what kind of a tablavala you need for a music like this

2436
03:35:33,100 --> 03:35:33,620
where

2437
03:35:33,780 --> 03:35:37,100
he has to be most unassuming and he is supporting

2438
03:35:37,100 --> 03:35:39,920
all the time the artist, should be the point.

2439
03:35:40,615 --> 03:35:43,945
I'm very happy you all are enjoying it so much

2440
03:35:43,985 --> 03:35:47,105
and that you are appreciative of it

2441
03:35:47,185 --> 03:35:49,145
cause, after all, it's a -

2442
03:35:49,145 --> 03:35:52,365
we have been brought up in this kind of [inaudible] style.

2443
03:35:52,365 --> 03:35:56,560
In my family, from my childhood, I have been earing nothing but classical music

2444
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:59,120
and all my life.

2445
03:35:59,120 --> 03:36:01,500
I've never known even one minute in my house

2446
03:36:01,500 --> 03:36:03,380
then where the music is not there:

2447
03:36:03,380 --> 03:36:06,140
somebody singing in this room or somebody singing in that room,

2448
03:36:06,240 --> 03:36:08,940
whatever may be the situation, there is music on.

2449
03:36:09,100 --> 03:36:13,740
So, for my ear it is tremendous but to my heart also.

2450
03:36:13,740 --> 03:36:17,500
And the way he has played, I must thank him very much on your behalf.

2451
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:20,860
From his heart, he has played, from his heart.

2452
03:36:21,500 --> 03:36:24,820
It's only to her presence that this can happen.

2453
03:36:25,100 --> 03:36:26,820
You all know this also.

2454
03:36:41,975 --> 03:36:43,225
 

2455
03:36:43,935 --> 03:36:46,975
 

2456
03:36:47,645 --> 03:36:49,615
 

2457
03:37:51,985 --> 03:37:53,355
 

2458
03:37:55,825 --> 03:37:56,825
 

2459
03:37:59,695 --> 03:38:02,075
 

2460
03:38:06,805 --> 03:38:07,805
 

2461
03:38:08,685 --> 03:38:09,685
 

2462
03:38:11,325 --> 03:38:12,325
 

2463
03:38:23,655 --> 03:38:25,735
 

2464
03:39:00,985 --> 03:39:01,985
 

2465
03:39:12,685 --> 03:39:13,685
 

2466
03:39:14,625 --> 03:39:15,625
 

2467
03:39:17,305 --> 03:39:18,305
 

2468
03:39:21,660 --> 03:39:26,900
"Avion" [plane] means "air" isn't it? "Wind" in French.

2469
03:39:28,200 --> 03:39:30,060
"Avion" is wind.

2470
03:39:30,060 --> 03:39:32,920
He says it is "guide" "avion" is "guide"

2471
03:39:33,120 --> 03:39:34,920
No, "avion", "avion".

2472
03:39:35,060 --> 03:39:35,840
"Avion"?

2473
03:39:35,840 --> 03:39:36,940
Is what?

2474
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:38,060
"Avion" is airplane.

2475
03:39:38,060 --> 03:39:42,180
Airplane. There's a lot of "avion" in the Avignon.

2476
03:39:44,680 --> 03:39:46,560
 

2477
03:40:29,160 --> 03:40:31,680
If you see, the sitar he has got

2478
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:33,660
a rakhi to it, you see?

2479
03:40:33,815 --> 03:40:36,235
You all know what is rakhi is.

2480
03:40:36,235 --> 03:40:38,985
So the sitar is his sister.

2481
03:40:39,240 --> 03:40:43,440
And the sisterly love is the purity of love,

2482
03:40:43,440 --> 03:40:45,320
absolute, pure love, you see.

2483
03:40:45,320 --> 03:40:47,820
And the sister is the protector of the brother.

2484
03:40:47,880 --> 03:40:51,880
So, this is how they tie rakhi to a sister, you see?

2485
03:40:52,500 --> 03:40:54,540
I hope you have noticed it.

2486
03:40:54,540 --> 03:40:56,540
[Hindi]

2487
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:59,320
 

2488
03:40:59,745 --> 03:41:01,765
 

2489
03:41:02,085 --> 03:41:03,195
 

2490
03:41:03,615 --> 03:41:05,295
 

2491
03:41:05,635 --> 03:41:07,535
 

2492
03:41:07,945 --> 03:41:09,505
 

2493
03:41:10,305 --> 03:41:11,305
 

2494
03:41:21,775 --> 03:41:22,775
 

2495
03:41:31,495 --> 03:41:32,495
 

2496
03:41:33,855 --> 03:41:34,855
 

2497
03:41:39,635 --> 03:41:40,635
 

2498
03:41:42,975 --> 03:41:43,975
 

2499
03:41:45,425 --> 03:41:46,425
 

2500
03:41:49,465 --> 03:41:50,465
 

2501
03:42:02,345 --> 03:42:03,345
 

2502
03:42:04,175 --> 03:42:05,175
 

2503
03:42:12,575 --> 03:42:14,035
 

2504
03:42:16,555 --> 03:42:17,605
 

2505
03:42:18,705 --> 03:42:19,705
 

2506
03:42:22,240 --> 03:42:23,240
 

2507
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:35,720
There is a circus on

2508
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:39,760
and it's a nice contrast to see the difference between the two.

2509
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:50,940
 

2510
03:42:56,980 --> 03:42:57,980
 

2511
03:43:21,880 --> 03:43:24,575
This is the raga which is called as Durga

2512
03:43:24,575 --> 03:43:26,955
as you must have heard it before also

2513
03:43:27,020 --> 03:43:29,140
and it's quite a difficult raga and

2514
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:34,120
also it is only with the five notes it is played

2515
03:43:34,280 --> 03:43:36,280
and there are very few ragas like that.

2516
03:43:36,875 --> 03:43:40,335
And one of them is Gunakali raga.

2517
03:43:40,615 --> 03:43:43,315
which is also played with the same style.

2518
03:43:43,415 --> 03:43:45,465
And I was surprised that

2519
03:43:45,465 --> 03:43:47,915
in certain countries,

2520
03:43:47,920 --> 03:43:50,980
they only know one raga.

2521
03:43:50,980 --> 03:43:55,600
Like Bhairava, it's a - it's the only raga they know in Iran.

2522
03:43:55,700 --> 03:43:58,375
Whether it is morning, evening, afternoon,

2523
03:43:58,375 --> 03:44:01,575
they sing just that one raga is Bhairava.

2524
03:44:01,580 --> 03:44:04,780
And I was surprised, I heard Gunakali in Japan.

2525
03:44:04,820 --> 03:44:05,380
Ah, ah.

2526
03:44:05,380 --> 03:44:09,100
Japanse have only idea of Gunakali, I don't know how they got it.

2527
03:44:09,440 --> 03:44:11,640
But only Gunakali nothing else.

2528
03:44:11,640 --> 03:44:12,360
Absolutely.

2529
03:44:12,360 --> 03:44:15,600
Absolutely. That's all. One raga they are masters.

2530
03:44:15,760 --> 03:44:16,560
They are mastering that raga.

2531
03:44:16,680 --> 03:44:19,320
One, but morning, evening, [Hindi]

2532
03:44:19,320 --> 03:44:20,140
 

2533
03:44:20,280 --> 03:44:24,740
And in a way, these ragas are morning ragas.  [Hindi]

2534
03:44:25,700 --> 03:44:28,940
Bhairava especially is a raga

2535
03:44:29,100 --> 03:44:32,600
all the time they sing without any discrimination.

2536
03:44:34,860 --> 03:44:37,520
But this is the time for Durga really.

2537
03:44:38,885 --> 03:44:40,535
Just before awakening,

2538
03:44:41,160 --> 03:44:45,960
the mother is calling that: "Get up now and meditate."

2539
03:44:50,580 --> 03:44:51,700
Ah!

2540
03:44:52,180 --> 03:44:54,800
How beautiful it is, just see.

2541
03:45:01,300 --> 03:45:02,300
 

2542
03:45:41,055 --> 03:45:42,055
 

2543
03:45:42,775 --> 03:45:43,775
 

2544
03:45:55,065 --> 03:45:56,065
 

2545
03:46:02,215 --> 03:46:03,215
 

2546
03:46:39,645 --> 03:46:41,085
 

2547
03:46:45,425 --> 03:46:46,425
 

2548
03:46:50,695 --> 03:46:51,695
 

2549
03:46:53,055 --> 03:46:54,055
 

2550
03:47:09,695 --> 03:47:10,695
 

2551
03:47:11,405 --> 03:47:12,405
 

2552
03:47:13,585 --> 03:47:14,585
 

2553
03:47:19,765 --> 03:47:20,765
 

2554
03:47:50,375 --> 03:47:51,375
 

2555
03:48:06,215 --> 03:48:07,215
 

2556
03:48:09,095 --> 03:48:10,095
 

2557
03:48:12,805 --> 03:48:13,805
 

2558
03:48:14,125 --> 03:48:15,125
 

2559
03:48:17,405 --> 03:48:18,405
 

2560
03:48:25,855 --> 03:48:26,855
 

2561
03:48:28,965 --> 03:48:29,965
 

2562
03:48:54,585 --> 03:48:55,585
 

2563
03:49:02,575 --> 03:49:03,575
 

2564
03:49:03,615 --> 03:49:05,365
 

2565
03:49:06,105 --> 03:49:08,555
 

2566
03:49:18,515 --> 03:49:19,515
 

2567
03:49:32,135 --> 03:49:33,135
 

2568
03:49:45,625 --> 03:49:46,625
 

2569
03:49:49,985 --> 03:49:50,985
 

2570
03:50:00,225 --> 03:50:01,225
 

2571
03:50:06,075 --> 03:50:07,075
 

2572
03:50:07,285 --> 03:50:08,375
 

2573
03:50:08,745 --> 03:50:09,945
 

2574
03:50:11,175 --> 03:50:12,175
 

2575
03:50:12,835 --> 03:50:13,835
 

2576
03:50:32,485 --> 03:50:33,635
 

2577
03:50:39,815 --> 03:50:40,815
 

2578
03:50:48,305 --> 03:50:49,305
 

2579
03:50:49,765 --> 03:50:50,765
 

2580
03:51:07,715 --> 03:51:08,715
 

2581
03:51:14,745 --> 03:51:15,745
 

2582
03:51:40,465 --> 03:51:43,515
 

2583
03:51:43,515 --> 03:51:46,965
 

2584
03:51:47,615 --> 03:51:48,615
 

2585
03:51:49,325 --> 03:51:52,215
 

2586
03:51:52,215 --> 03:51:54,815
 

2587
03:51:54,815 --> 03:51:57,815
 

2588
03:51:57,815 --> 03:51:58,975
 

2589
03:51:59,855 --> 03:52:00,855
 

2590
03:52:01,185 --> 03:52:02,185
 

2591
03:52:04,115 --> 03:52:07,505
 

2592
03:52:07,665 --> 03:52:10,245
 

2593
03:52:10,375 --> 03:52:13,085
 

2594
03:52:13,085 --> 03:52:14,085
 

2595
03:52:14,345 --> 03:52:15,475
 

2596
03:52:15,955 --> 03:52:19,065
 

2597
03:52:19,065 --> 03:52:20,065
 

2598
03:52:20,245 --> 03:52:22,385
 

2599
03:52:23,065 --> 03:52:24,065
 

2600
03:52:59,895 --> 03:53:00,895
 

2601
03:53:01,415 --> 03:53:02,415
 

2602
03:53:02,855 --> 03:53:03,855
 

2603
03:53:29,505 --> 03:53:30,505
 

2604
03:53:34,495 --> 03:53:35,495
 

2605
03:53:43,205 --> 03:53:44,205
 

2606
03:53:54,755 --> 03:53:55,755
 

2607
03:54:02,105 --> 03:54:03,105
 

2608
03:54:09,595 --> 03:54:10,595
 

2609
03:54:14,155 --> 03:54:15,155
 

2610
03:54:16,255 --> 03:54:17,775
 

2611
03:54:18,995 --> 03:54:19,995
 

2612
03:54:21,165 --> 03:54:22,165
 

2613
03:54:22,925 --> 03:54:23,925
 

2614
03:54:28,745 --> 03:54:29,745
 

2615
03:54:32,975 --> 03:54:34,155
 

2616
03:54:35,435 --> 03:54:36,925
 

2617
03:54:37,725 --> 03:54:39,085
 

2618
03:54:39,975 --> 03:54:41,725
 

2619
03:54:42,635 --> 03:54:43,635
 

2620
03:54:44,425 --> 03:54:45,425
 

2621
03:54:52,355 --> 03:54:53,355
 

2622
03:54:55,345 --> 03:54:56,345
 

2623
03:55:04,635 --> 03:55:05,805
 

2624
03:55:06,945 --> 03:55:07,945
 

2625
03:55:36,255 --> 03:55:37,255
 

2626
03:55:37,605 --> 03:55:38,605
 

2627
03:55:43,045 --> 03:55:44,045
 

2628
03:56:05,345 --> 03:56:06,345
 

2629
03:56:07,595 --> 03:56:08,595
 

2630
03:56:12,125 --> 03:56:13,125
 

2631
03:56:32,425 --> 03:56:33,425
 

2632
03:56:34,125 --> 03:56:35,845
 

2633
03:56:41,585 --> 03:56:42,585
 

2634
03:56:42,705 --> 03:56:43,705
 

2635
03:57:06,965 --> 03:57:08,135
 

2636
03:57:09,805 --> 03:57:10,805
 

2637
03:57:21,705 --> 03:57:22,705
 

2638
03:57:28,775 --> 03:57:29,775
 

2639
03:57:42,755 --> 03:57:43,755
 

2640
03:57:45,795 --> 03:57:46,795
 

2641
03:57:57,805 --> 03:57:58,805
 

2642
03:58:01,115 --> 03:58:02,115
 

2643
03:58:02,195 --> 03:58:03,195
 

2644
03:58:14,145 --> 03:58:15,145
 

2645
03:58:24,055 --> 03:58:25,055
 

2646
03:58:25,905 --> 03:58:26,905
 

2647
03:58:27,725 --> 03:58:28,675
 

2648
03:58:28,675 --> 03:58:29,675
 

2649
03:58:40,005 --> 03:58:41,005
 

2650
03:58:45,835 --> 03:58:46,835
 

2651
03:59:08,945 --> 03:59:09,945
 

2652
03:59:26,545 --> 03:59:27,795
 

2653
03:59:30,315 --> 03:59:31,315
 

2654
03:59:39,235 --> 03:59:40,235
 

2655
03:59:41,105 --> 03:59:42,105
 

2656
03:59:47,880 --> 03:59:48,880
 

2657
04:04:27,500 --> 04:04:28,820
 

2658
04:25:43,500 --> 04:25:47,920
Now, their last raga is Bhairavi.

2659
04:25:47,920 --> 04:25:49,920
It has to be played in the old

2660
04:25:49,920 --> 04:25:51,920
traditional ways and

2661
04:25:51,920 --> 04:25:56,760
it's a raga that is in praise of the power of,

2662
04:25:59,260 --> 04:26:01,080
we can say,

2663
04:26:01,480 --> 04:26:02,920
of the Spirit.

2664
04:26:02,920 --> 04:26:08,960
Because it is a- it has such beautiful notes and

2665
04:26:08,960 --> 04:26:10,960
[Hindi].

2666
04:26:12,580 --> 04:26:17,100
Notes which are - it's a complete "sampurna"

2667
04:26:17,100 --> 04:26:19,100
it's a complete "aga" it's a "Purnima". Hey?

2668
04:26:19,100 --> 04:26:20,260
[Babamama in Hindi]

2669
04:26:20,260 --> 04:26:23,700
All the twelves notes are in it. So, you see,

2670
04:26:23,700 --> 04:26:29,120
it's such a complete raga and it has to be played in all due respect to it.

2671
04:26:29,120 --> 04:26:31,120
And it is a ragani Shri Mataji.

2672
04:26:31,120 --> 04:26:33,480
It's a ragani regarded as you see, because

2673
04:26:33,600 --> 04:26:35,120
 

2674
04:26:35,620 --> 04:26:40,040
Now, as you know that the heart chakra has got -

2675
04:26:40,040 --> 04:26:43,300
heart chakra has got twelve petals.

2676
04:26:44,440 --> 04:26:46,440
And the Durga resides on the heart chakra.

2677
04:26:47,960 --> 04:26:53,420
Now, the Durga's qualities are that she is protective of her children.

2678
04:26:54,300 --> 04:26:57,420
She's very gentle, very soft with her children.

2679
04:26:57,980 --> 04:27:05,660
And she is extremely horrifying to the crooks, to the satanic people, to the negative people.

2680
04:27:05,660 --> 04:27:09,180
So, in this raga, I think because the-

2681
04:27:09,460 --> 04:27:11,360
there are - it's spaced out,

2682
04:27:11,660 --> 04:27:15,360
the notes are spaced out.

2683
04:27:15,360 --> 04:27:18,580
So, either you could play it slow or you could play it fast.

2684
04:27:18,580 --> 04:27:19,900
Nothing in between.

2685
04:27:20,100 --> 04:27:22,640
That's why it is on a Durga style, you see.

2686
04:27:22,640 --> 04:27:25,300
Either she's extremely gentle

2687
04:27:25,300 --> 04:27:27,600
or she is extremely horrifying.

2688
04:27:28,320 --> 04:27:32,440
So, because she has a double function, is one is to look after her children

2689
04:27:32,440 --> 04:27:37,640
and another is: protect her children from the devils.

2690
04:27:37,640 --> 04:27:40,240
So she has to be very quick about it

2691
04:27:40,240 --> 04:27:45,220
to fight them and to, in every way, to frighten them

2692
04:27:45,540 --> 04:27:47,600
and to be alert about them.

2693
04:27:48,180 --> 04:27:51,060
So, in the second part, you all became very alert I saw it.

2694
04:27:51,140 --> 04:27:53,320
The first part, you were having a lullaby

2695
04:27:53,460 --> 04:27:57,040
because it was the mother's love that was playing.

2696
04:27:57,300 --> 04:27:58,920
But the second part, you became alert

2697
04:27:58,920 --> 04:28:00,920
because she has to fight.

2698
04:28:01,380 --> 04:28:06,260
Now, this is such a nice raga

2699
04:28:06,260 --> 04:28:10,920
because it gives you a better sense of security

2700
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:12,180
within yourselves.

2701
04:28:12,520 --> 04:28:14,920
Will give you a sense of security.

2702
04:28:14,920 --> 04:28:19,240
And also as you know, medically that it's important to build up this chakra

2703
04:28:19,720 --> 04:28:22,960
because that gives you antibodies created more

2704
04:28:23,240 --> 04:28:26,400
so to fight all the diseases, to fight all the foreign things

2705
04:28:26,400 --> 04:28:28,400
which try to attack us.

2706
04:28:28,400 --> 04:28:31,420
So, this raga is so apt, absolutely apt

2707
04:28:31,420 --> 04:28:37,420
for today's atmosphere and for today's need,

2708
04:28:37,420 --> 04:28:41,680
that we have to have the security of the Mother and the protection of the Mother.

2709
04:28:42,220 --> 04:28:45,400
And that all the evil forces must be finished from this world.

2710
04:28:45,400 --> 04:28:48,720
And that's how this raga has a very great significance

2711
04:28:48,800 --> 04:28:52,480
and I thank you very much for feeling this raga,

2712
04:28:52,480 --> 04:28:53,340
see.

2713
04:29:02,200 --> 04:29:05,860
This is the now last five minutes he would like to play,

2714
04:29:05,860 --> 04:29:07,860
he asked the Bhairavi

2715
04:29:09,520 --> 04:29:13,360
which is a complete raga as you can call, is the complete Purnima.

2716
04:29:13,660 --> 04:29:17,420
All the - all the notes are there.

2717
04:29:18,000 --> 04:29:23,480
And it is played in various ways, is in various styles and

2718
04:29:24,060 --> 04:29:28,860
is used for so many expressions of

2719
04:29:29,240 --> 04:29:31,660
your feelings and things.

2720
04:29:32,300 --> 04:29:36,940
But in this also, there's a beautiful one of a song as you know

2721
04:29:37,420 --> 04:29:39,420
Dayani Bhavani is the one

2722
04:29:40,160 --> 04:29:43,520
which is a song about the Mother Goddess.

2723
04:29:44,300 --> 04:29:48,860
And in this [inaudible] there's a little mixture in the-

2724
04:29:49,140 --> 04:29:50,300
I don't know if it is an

2725
04:29:50,300 --> 04:29:51,800
absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

2726
04:29:51,800 --> 04:29:53,800
 

2727
04:29:53,900 --> 04:29:55,840
[Hindi]

2728
04:29:55,840 --> 04:29:58,880
It is to be played absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi.

2729
04:29:58,880 --> 04:30:00,880
[Hindi]

2730
04:30:01,740 --> 04:30:03,940
 

2731
04:30:03,940 --> 04:30:05,940
 

2732
04:30:10,880 --> 04:30:13,960
It should be played in absolute Shuddha Bhairavi.

2733
04:30:13,960 --> 04:30:15,960
[Hindi]

2734
04:30:15,960 --> 04:30:17,960
 

2735
04:30:17,960 --> 04:30:19,960
 

2736
04:30:19,960 --> 04:30:21,960
 

2737
04:30:21,960 --> 04:30:23,960
 

2738
04:30:28,300 --> 04:30:30,300
It is to be played absolutely in pure Bhairavi.

2739
04:30:30,300 --> 04:30:31,740
This is the best way

2740
04:30:31,840 --> 04:30:34,300
because Bhairavi is the name of the Goddess.

2741
04:30:34,700 --> 04:30:35,980
So, that will be the-

2742
04:30:35,980 --> 04:30:37,940
 

2743
04:30:37,940 --> 04:30:40,300
[Hindi]

2744
04:30:40,700 --> 04:30:45,080
So, this is the purity of it, purity of it creates that

2745
04:30:45,880 --> 04:30:48,100
feeling and that-

2746
04:30:49,380 --> 04:30:54,400
I mean it awakens that Deity so that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

2747
04:30:55,460 --> 04:30:58,420
 

2748
04:30:58,420 --> 04:31:00,420
 

2749
04:31:00,420 --> 04:31:02,420
 

2750
04:31:02,420 --> 04:31:04,420
 

2751
04:31:08,320 --> 04:31:10,320
 

2752
04:31:10,320 --> 04:31:12,320
 

2753
04:31:15,260 --> 04:31:21,720
Ah! She, my sister is accepting that they may make some mistakes in the Shuddhata [unsure].

2754
04:31:22,040 --> 04:31:24,040
 

2755
04:31:24,040 --> 04:31:26,040
 

2756
04:31:27,800 --> 04:31:29,800
 

2757
04:31:32,520 --> 04:31:36,400
Which I detected, you see, I'm not such a musician as you are,

2758
04:31:36,400 --> 04:31:40,300
but I did detect that there's a little bit [inaudible]

2759
04:31:43,920 --> 04:31:45,920
 

2760
04:31:45,920 --> 04:31:47,920
 

2761
04:31:47,920 --> 04:31:49,920
 

2762
04:31:49,920 --> 04:31:51,920
 

2763
04:31:52,580 --> 04:31:54,580
 

2764
04:31:54,580 --> 04:31:56,580
 

2765
04:31:56,580 --> 04:31:58,580
 

2766
04:31:58,580 --> 04:32:00,580
 

2767
04:32:00,580 --> 04:32:02,100
 

2768
04:32:02,140 --> 04:32:06,400
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, I mean, such a lot of freedom.

2769
04:32:06,660 --> 04:32:08,920
Ah! You can do what you like with it but

2770
04:32:08,920 --> 04:32:12,100
only thing that you have to keep to the ragas

2771
04:32:12,200 --> 04:32:16,780
and you have to keep to the "swaras" [notes] and everything and

2772
04:32:17,420 --> 04:32:21,660
it cannot just go crazy from one to another like that.

2773
04:32:22,040 --> 04:32:25,080
So, it is like a big aeroplane which is going in the air

2774
04:32:25,080 --> 04:32:29,400
with everything completely fixed properly, you see, so it can go anywhere.

2775
04:32:29,940 --> 04:32:33,400
Unless and until you it's fixed by its own maryadas, it cannot go.

2776
04:32:33,980 --> 04:32:37,120
So, that has to be there. So first, the ragas are built.

2777
04:32:37,180 --> 04:32:40,000
And built in such a way that they are absolutely perfect.

2778
04:32:40,040 --> 04:32:42,920
And then you can go wherever you feel like, nothing will happen.

2779
04:32:44,020 --> 04:32:45,600
[Hindi]

2780
04:32:47,520 --> 04:32:49,520
 

2781
04:32:50,600 --> 04:32:52,600
 

2782
04:32:52,600 --> 04:32:56,860
 

2783
04:32:57,000 --> 04:33:01,940
 

2784
04:33:01,940 --> 04:33:07,420
 

2785
04:33:07,420 --> 04:33:12,660
 

2786
04:33:12,660 --> 04:33:16,080
 

2787
04:33:16,080 --> 04:33:18,080
 

2788
04:33:18,080 --> 04:33:20,080
 

2789
04:33:20,080 --> 04:33:24,180
 

2790
04:33:24,180 --> 04:33:28,480
 

2791
04:33:28,480 --> 04:33:33,400
 

2792
04:33:33,400 --> 04:33:35,400
 

2793
04:33:35,400 --> 04:33:37,400
 

2794
04:33:37,400 --> 04:33:39,400
 

2795
04:33:39,420 --> 04:33:41,480
Then it will become jazz Shri Mataji.

2796
04:33:41,480 --> 04:33:43,480
Jazz. Or even worse than that, could be.

2797
04:33:43,560 --> 04:33:48,020
 

2798
04:33:48,260 --> 04:33:51,860
 

2799
04:33:56,680 --> 04:33:58,680
Ah, ah.

2800
04:33:58,680 --> 04:33:59,680
 

2801
04:33:59,760 --> 04:34:03,500
First, he will play all the twelves notes which are moved in Bhairavi.

2802
04:34:03,500 --> 04:34:06,620
And then you see how he keeps to them.

2803
04:34:06,620 --> 04:34:10,060
He keeps to that mood that way.

2804
04:34:10,060 --> 04:34:12,060
 

2805
04:34:12,060 --> 04:34:14,060
 

2806
04:34:14,060 --> 04:34:16,060
Woah, wah.

2807
04:34:18,780 --> 04:34:22,460
It's the heart chakra. it's the heart chakra of Shiva.

2808
04:34:27,420 --> 04:34:31,880
 

2809
04:34:31,880 --> 04:34:33,880
 

2810
04:34:33,880 --> 04:34:35,880
 

2811
04:35:16,080 --> 04:35:18,080
 

2812
04:35:19,580 --> 04:35:21,580
 

2813
04:35:24,940 --> 04:35:26,240
 

2814
04:35:34,820 --> 04:35:36,820
 

2815
04:35:42,160 --> 04:35:44,160
 

2816
04:36:14,860 --> 04:36:16,860
 

2817
04:36:30,500 --> 04:36:32,500
 

2818
04:36:32,500 --> 04:36:34,200
 

2819
04:36:34,500 --> 04:36:36,500
Surrendering.

2820
04:36:36,500 --> 04:36:38,500
 

2821
04:36:41,560 --> 04:36:44,880
The surrendering, you see, as Islam means "surrender".

2822
04:36:45,020 --> 04:36:48,400
Islam is the "surrender".

2823
04:42:15,680 --> 04:42:20,680
 

2824
04:42:26,460 --> 04:42:29,320
He's been calling [inaudible].

2825
04:42:53,500 --> 04:42:55,840
Now, this is the call  [inaudible].

2826
04:42:55,840 --> 04:42:57,840
 

2827
04:42:57,840 --> 04:42:59,840
 

2828
04:42:59,840 --> 04:43:01,840
 

2829
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,840
 

2830
05:20:27,660 --> 05:20:30,060
What an enjoyment! What an enjoyment!

2831
05:20:30,740 --> 05:20:32,740
Tremendous!

2832
05:20:32,740 --> 05:20:35,400
 

2833
05:21:23,320 --> 05:21:25,540
Please, be seated.

2834
05:21:29,140 --> 05:21:32,400
I have to especially thank him for one thing

2835
05:21:32,980 --> 05:21:36,640
that he has now prepared really for you,

2836
05:21:36,940 --> 05:21:38,940
the Guru Purnima for you.

2837
05:21:39,360 --> 05:21:41,460
He's worked it out really very well.

2838
05:21:41,460 --> 05:21:44,140
I can see that, I can feel it.

2839
05:21:44,800 --> 05:21:50,160
It has worked within ourselves that depth and that beauty.

2840
05:21:50,700 --> 05:21:56,780
And now with music, you see, it's this excavation within ourselves, you see.

2841
05:21:57,420 --> 05:21:59,800
Facing it within yourself.

2842
05:21:59,840 --> 05:22:04,040
All these things with music become

2843
05:22:04,040 --> 05:22:07,380
not only harmless but also so gentle,

2844
05:22:07,380 --> 05:22:09,380
that you don't feel that it is happening.

2845
05:22:09,380 --> 05:22:11,140
It just works.

2846
05:22:11,320 --> 05:22:16,380
You see, the- like very gentle waves you see, it works within you and

2847
05:22:16,800 --> 05:22:20,700
you start developing that personality which is very important

2848
05:22:20,700 --> 05:22:22,700
for a function like Guru Purnima.

2849
05:22:22,700 --> 05:22:29,160
And the beauty and the joy

2850
05:22:29,160 --> 05:22:33,360
they all work it out so beautifully that you don't feel that it is all working,

2851
05:22:33,360 --> 05:22:35,080
but I know it's really.

2852
05:22:35,080 --> 05:22:41,240
But, supposing, if I say something as a Guru, maybe I may hurt you.

2853
05:22:41,240 --> 05:22:47,820
You may feel upset and you also may feel facing yourself

2854
05:22:47,940 --> 05:22:51,220
a little bit, sometimes reluctant maybe diffident.

2855
05:22:51,840 --> 05:22:56,100
You might feel little sort of dejected or depressed.

2856
05:22:56,620 --> 05:23:00,660
Or you may feel sometimes also if elevate you

2857
05:23:00,720 --> 05:23:03,160
you might feel egoistical, you see.

2858
05:23:03,160 --> 05:23:10,540
So the words could be, could not render service as properly as the notes can

2859
05:23:10,540 --> 05:23:14,140
because the notes just penetrate within you

2860
05:23:14,160 --> 05:23:19,380
and work it out so smoothly  that you don't feel it's working there.

2861
05:23:19,380 --> 05:23:21,340
It's working no doubt.

2862
05:23:21,340 --> 05:23:24,040
It's like mantras it works, like mantras only.

2863
05:23:24,780 --> 05:23:30,220
And when it's enlightened notes, it has great effect.

2864
05:23:30,960 --> 05:23:33,140
I haven't brought you photographs

2865
05:23:33,140 --> 05:23:35,140
where, when you are playing before Me,

2866
05:23:35,140 --> 05:23:37,140
you go into complete lights.

2867
05:23:38,480 --> 05:23:40,480
I have got those photographs with Me.

2868
05:23:40,480 --> 05:23:43,300
Of course, also we have got  the [inaudible]

2869
05:23:43,640 --> 05:23:47,340
And we have got photographs, now, tomorrow we will be able to show you,

2870
05:23:47,340 --> 05:23:50,580
where the lights change their forms,

2871
05:23:50,580 --> 05:23:53,880
how through vibrations, how they change their forms, you see.

2872
05:23:54,520 --> 05:23:57,680
And how the vibrations work it out, you see?

2873
05:23:58,400 --> 05:24:03,240
But the, even the notes are used by vibrations as "vahanas" [vessel]

2874
05:24:04,020 --> 05:24:06,360
The notes are used and the notes

2875
05:24:06,360 --> 05:24:11,140
take the "vahanas" position

2876
05:24:11,140 --> 05:24:12,820
and they penetrate.

2877
05:24:12,820 --> 05:24:17,000
When there is somebody: you are singing before a Realized soul

2878
05:24:17,000 --> 05:24:20,020
or an evolved personality,

2879
05:24:20,020 --> 05:24:25,400
then the Chaitanya flows within you.

2880
05:24:25,400 --> 05:24:29,200
But notes are very helpful, I've seen, the beautiful notes,

2881
05:24:29,200 --> 05:24:30,720
and in harmony, you see.

2882
05:24:30,860 --> 05:24:32,820
It's so much in harmony with you,

2883
05:24:32,820 --> 05:24:34,820
that you don't feel the penetration.

2884
05:24:35,540 --> 05:24:42,180
You don't feel the injection, you don't feel the going within you.

2885
05:24:42,180 --> 05:24:44,320
Just it works and it just moves and

2886
05:24:44,620 --> 05:24:47,360
I was seeing your brain also opening out quite a lot

2887
05:24:47,620 --> 05:24:50,420
because the heart is so much connected with your brain now,

2888
05:24:50,500 --> 05:24:52,020
you are integrated.

2889
05:24:52,020 --> 05:24:55,040
So it's wonderful and you are all becoming thoughtless

2890
05:24:55,040 --> 05:24:56,600
and beautiful.

2891
05:24:56,700 --> 05:25:00,820
I think you all have enjoyed his things and we have to thank him very much

2892
05:25:01,180 --> 05:25:04,540
because our Guru Purnima day that he agreed to come

2893
05:25:04,540 --> 05:25:05,040
 

2894
05:25:05,060 --> 05:25:08,540
and has done the job halfway for Me.

2895
05:25:08,540 --> 05:25:14,680
I'm thankful to him that now, even if I say something, you won't feel hurt.

2896
05:25:14,680 --> 05:25:16,680
 

2897
05:25:16,680 --> 05:25:18,680
 

2898
05:25:23,360 --> 05:25:25,360
 

2899
05:25:25,360 --> 05:25:27,360
 

2900
05:25:31,020 --> 05:25:33,880
It is nice to be a Mother.

2901
05:25:33,880 --> 05:25:38,020
Mother is a very easy thing, it's to just to express your love and

2902
05:25:38,180 --> 05:25:39,840
the children are nice.

2903
05:25:39,920 --> 05:25:43,340
But for a Mother to be a Guru is the most difficult task.

2904
05:25:43,340 --> 05:25:47,640
And that, if I have to do, a Mother to be a Guru,

2905
05:25:47,640 --> 05:25:50,960
then I think this preparation is a very good idea because

2906
05:25:50,960 --> 05:25:53,540
first of all, now, you are smoothed out

2907
05:25:53,540 --> 05:25:55,900
and you are much better

2908
05:25:56,000 --> 05:25:58,940
so it's all right, as a Guru I can tell you some things.

2909
05:25:59,080 --> 05:26:03,600
Otherwise, for a Mother to be Guru is the worst thing that she can do

2910
05:26:03,680 --> 05:26:08,540
and to act as a Guru but sometimes, you have to be corrected.

2911
05:26:09,880 --> 05:26:15,080
But I think this one has created a beautiful atmosphere and I am very thankful to him

2912
05:26:15,080 --> 05:26:17,080
for this preparation

2913
05:26:17,080 --> 05:26:19,760
of your minds and your brains.

2914
05:26:19,760 --> 05:26:25,200
We are very honoured and, as I said in the beginning, I'm extremely honoured.

2915
05:26:25,940 --> 05:26:30,480
And, of course, it's very difficult to use words

2916
05:26:30,480 --> 05:26:34,100
on how I feel at this moment.

2917
05:26:34,100 --> 05:26:38,520
Because to be invited to play for Guru Purnima

2918
05:26:38,520 --> 05:26:41,220
is a great blessing for us.

2919
05:26:41,220 --> 05:26:45,540
And it's your blessing and it's a great honour and

2920
05:26:45,540 --> 05:26:50,100
we would have been very disappointed if you had not invited us to play today.

2921
05:26:50,340 --> 05:26:53,420
I was anxious that you should be invited actually.

2922
05:26:53,420 --> 05:26:53,920
Thank you.

2923
05:26:53,920 --> 05:26:56,460
That you should be here and you should do this

2924
05:26:56,460 --> 05:27:00,360
because you see, if you have seen the mid-career that you do

2925
05:27:00,460 --> 05:27:04,800
with that you were pulling the strings of their hearts, I could see it clearly

2926
05:27:04,920 --> 05:27:05,880
the importance, you see.

2927
05:27:06,900 --> 05:27:11,600
Some or other, I thought I can work through you better

2928
05:27:11,600 --> 05:27:14,560
than through my own words directly.

2929
05:27:15,520 --> 05:27:18,900
It's an indirect way of working out things like this

2930
05:27:18,900 --> 05:27:21,400
and you have been very, very helpful,  cooperative.

2931
05:27:21,400 --> 05:27:21,900
 

2932
05:27:21,900 --> 05:27:24,300
I'm thankful to you for this wisdom.

2933
05:27:24,300 --> 05:27:27,120
So, I don't know how to also

2934
05:27:27,120 --> 05:27:29,320
say something about

2935
05:27:29,320 --> 05:27:31,320
Indian music.

2936
05:27:31,320 --> 05:27:33,340
But I can definitely say

2937
05:27:33,340 --> 05:27:36,800
that the way you are appreciating Indian music

2938
05:27:36,900 --> 05:27:38,900
is really very creditable.

2939
05:27:38,900 --> 05:27:44,500
I just can't understand really how you people are so much appreciative of this music.

2940
05:27:44,500 --> 05:27:46,500
I'm just- it's the Spirit

2941
05:27:46,500 --> 05:27:48,500
or whatever you may say

2942
05:27:48,500 --> 05:27:53,160
it's something remarkable and even the artists are so enamoured by that.

2943
05:27:53,240 --> 05:27:54,240
To see such a -

2944
05:27:54,240 --> 05:27:54,740
Absolutely.

2945
05:27:54,860 --> 05:27:56,820
Absolutely. They're having rapport and all that.

2946
05:27:56,820 --> 05:27:58,340
They are very much enamoured by you.

2947
05:27:58,480 --> 05:27:59,080
Wonderful.

2948
05:27:59,080 --> 05:28:05,260
And they are very thankful to you the way you are just following every note and every movement

2949
05:28:05,260 --> 05:28:06,140
 

2950
05:28:06,140 --> 05:28:10,060
with such intense concentration.

2951
05:28:10,060 --> 05:28:12,060
 

2952
05:28:12,060 --> 05:28:16,300
But it's your blessings Mataji, it's your blessing that this whole atmosphere

2953
05:28:16,380 --> 05:28:16,920
Yes.

2954
05:28:16,920 --> 05:28:18,700
worked out like this.  Otherwise...

2955
05:28:18,700 --> 05:28:22,420
Really more for - I don't know whom to thank. You or their aim.

2956
05:28:22,420 --> 05:28:26,200
But I think it is mutual thanking is needed

2957
05:28:26,200 --> 05:28:28,500
because you were enjoying him and he was enjoying you.

2958
05:28:28,500 --> 05:28:30,780
Otherwise, it would not have been possible.

2959
05:28:30,780 --> 05:28:35,640
Without a proper audience, artist also doesn't get the encouragement to play so well.

2960
05:28:35,640 --> 05:28:37,360
[Hindi]

2961
05:28:37,360 --> 05:28:40,080
Audience has to have a rapport otherwise

2962
05:28:40,220 --> 05:28:43,400
[Hindi]

2963
05:28:43,800 --> 05:28:48,940
 

2964
05:28:48,940 --> 05:28:50,940
 

2965
05:28:50,940 --> 05:28:52,940
 

2966
05:28:52,940 --> 05:28:55,560
You have not put anything for the Russians so far here?

2967
05:28:55,560 --> 05:28:57,560
There are too many there, it seems.

2968
05:28:57,560 --> 05:28:59,560
 

2969
05:29:00,300 --> 05:29:03,040
Just simple thing like that.

2970
05:29:03,040 --> 05:29:05,040
Moscow and then Kyiv.

2971
05:29:05,040 --> 05:29:07,040
Moscow, Leningrad.

2972
05:29:07,040 --> 05:29:09,040
Kyiv also.

2973
05:29:09,040 --> 05:29:11,040
 

2974
05:29:11,040 --> 05:29:11,940
 

2975
05:29:12,140 --> 05:29:16,660
[Hindi]

2976
05:29:16,660 --> 05:29:18,660
 

2977
05:29:18,660 --> 05:29:20,660
 

2978
05:29:21,700 --> 05:29:24,140
A little gift for him from you all.

2979
05:29:24,140 --> 05:29:24,660
 

2980
05:29:24,660 --> 05:29:26,660
 

2981
05:29:26,660 --> 05:29:30,900
Only what I can tell him is to keep the music on.

2982
05:29:30,900 --> 05:29:32,020
 

2983
05:29:32,160 --> 05:29:34,160
[Hindi]

2984
05:29:34,160 --> 05:29:34,660
 

2985
05:29:34,660 --> 05:29:36,660
 

2986
05:29:36,660 --> 05:29:38,660
 

2987
05:29:38,660 --> 05:29:55,160
 

2988
05:29:55,160 --> 05:29:57,160
 

2989
05:29:57,160 --> 05:29:59,160
 

2990
05:29:59,160 --> 05:30:01,160
 

2991
05:30:01,160 --> 05:30:03,160
 

2992
05:30:03,160 --> 05:30:05,160
 

2993
05:30:05,160 --> 05:30:07,160
 

2994
05:30:07,160 --> 05:30:09,160
 

2995
05:30:10,000 --> 05:30:13,680
So, now for- what should I say?

2996
05:30:13,680 --> 05:30:15,660
"Good morning" to you?

2997
05:30:15,660 --> 05:30:16,820
 

2998
05:30:16,820 --> 05:30:19,660
I think still that will be about -

2999
05:30:19,660 --> 05:30:21,660
till twelve o'clock you can have rest.

3000
05:30:21,660 --> 05:30:23,380
Then we'll see you. All right?

3001
05:30:23,380 --> 05:30:25,160
May God bless you. Thank you

3002
05:30:25,160 --> 05:30:25,660
 

3003
05:30:25,660 --> 05:30:27,660
[Hindi]

3004
05:30:27,660 --> 05:30:29,660
 

3005
05:30:29,660 --> 05:30:31,660
 

3006
05:30:31,660 --> 05:30:33,660
 

3007
05:30:33,660 --> 05:30:35,660
 

3008
05:30:35,660 --> 05:30:37,660
 

3009
05:30:37,660 --> 05:30:42,020
 

3010
05:30:42,020 --> 05:30:44,020
 

3011
05:30:44,020 --> 05:30:46,020
 

3012
05:30:46,020 --> 05:30:48,020
 

3013
05:30:48,020 --> 05:30:50,540
