1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,450
Happy Diwali.

2
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,160
Wish you all a very happy Diwali.

3
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,570
You saw various kinds of dances.

4
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,170
you must try to understand one thing from them

5
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,050
that whoever composed or spoke about them

6
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,220
Everyone spoke of one and the same thing.

7
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,060
The most important thing that everyone said

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,130
was 'God is one'.

9
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,230
 

10
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,460
 'God is one'.

11
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,200
There is no dispute amongst them.

12
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,670
They incarnate on Earth in order to destroy the evil

13
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,700
and to condemn the evil doers.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
That is happening everywhere.

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,530
I find everywhere

16
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:46,000
the evil people are getting exposed.

17
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,740
Now, it is your duty also

18
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,700
to identify them who are evil,

19
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,930
working against the will of God.

20
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,750
Those Who go to any extreme for the sake of money.

21
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,000
They  will all go to hell.

22
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,730
We really do not know how many types of hells exist.

23
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,500
The environment or the place where you are sitting now

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
is far beyond those hells.

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,030
It has no connection with the hell at all.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,040
But, in spite of your being at this place

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,190
if you continue commiting sins and practice all sorts of wrong things,

28
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,900
then  you could go to hell too.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,930
There are various kinds of hell

30
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,760
and nice arrangements are there to go to those hells. 

31
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,230
Because,those who are supposed to go hell

32
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,600
can never even realize where are they going.

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,600
While those who are saved,they go to the heaven.

34
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,250
So, sitting at earth level nobody can know

35
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,380
that "I'll have to go to hell',

36
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,900
or by commiting wrong things, 'I'll  go to hell'.

37
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,110
The meaning of 'Diwali' itself is :

38
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,650
like the lamps lit outside,

39
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,830
should be lit within you.

40
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:45,000
You must also realize that you are 

41
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,420
like the lights in this world of darkness.

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,640
You are the lamps and you're the lights. You have to emit the light.

43
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,580
But, if the same is not fully enlightened from within,

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,060
then how can you emit the light?

45
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,660
You must also think  over it.

46
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,460
That is why in the first place, the Sahaja Yogis

47
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,030
should know that the light is fully established within.

48
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,460
Possibly that was the purpose

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,030
for which we had to come to this world.

50
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,900
Until Jesus Christ no one ever spoke on these subjects.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,010
He incarnated at the Agnya Chakra level 
52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:37,430
and showed the world that He did not have any ego within Him.

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,100
He was the son of the God,

53
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,970
yet He had no ego.

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Those who came before Him

55
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,960
spoke but very little.

56
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,400
Christ came and wanted that our Agnya chakra should become all right.

57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,300
Incidentally that Agnya chakra catches too much in your Delhi.

58
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
What could be the reason for it?

59
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,400
At the first place the English people came here to rule

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,630
and then Englishmen taught us arrogancy.

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,160
They can easily be made out from your conversations.

62
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,890
I have seen those days also

63
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,160
when our country was dependent.

64
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,160
But, you've come out of that dependency.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,660
Now there is 'swatantrata'.

66
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,260
And what is 'swatantranta'  supposed to be?  Is to know the 'Swa'

67
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,900
('ownself') and whoever has known his 'Self',

68
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,150
Knows the 'tantra' (system) of the 'Self'.

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,070
 

70
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,050
Through Sahaja Yoga you have come to know about yourself.

71
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,630
And now you know that you are the 'tantra'.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,620
Therefore, you have to walk on the path of that 'tantra' of the 'self'.

73
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,130
Lot of works have been done in Delhi, they are visible.

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,660
Works have also been done beyond Delhi.

75
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,710
Now, the various problems in the people here are very well known to you.

76
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,630
I need not tell you that.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,070
But , now that you have become 'swatantra' (independent),

78
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,040
so you must be able to judge yourself whether you possess such problems within  or not.

79
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,310
First of all the problem is

80
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,200
that you have your own Agnya Chakra caught up.

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,700
Jesus Christ passed away. He went to the cross,

82
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,400
yet we did not learn anything from it.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,030
On the contrary, wherever there are Christian countries,

84
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,100
they possess tremendous ego.

85
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,120
They had their influence on us too.

86
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,630
But, the worst part we find here is 

87
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,380
that we donot know each other.

88
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,640
There is quarrel everywhere,

89
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,030
fights everywhere.

90
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,640
There is no clarity in understanding amongst each other.

91
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,820
So the first thing is that our minds need to be cleansed.

92
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,860
Everything is possible in Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,350
People can attain any position from anywhere.

94
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,820
It is not necessary for that reason to go and sit in the Himalayas .

95
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,160
You can do it here in this city of Delhi itself.

96
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,230
But, if you look around,

97
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
you will find egoistical people.

98
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,130
They have their Agnya chakra severely caught up.

99
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,430
So it is really very difficult.

100
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,450
Now, god has given another new thing called 'cancer'.

101
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,300
If you have cancer and  your Agnya chakra is not set all right,

102
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,600
then it can never get cured.

103
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,030
And there will be great trouble.

104
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,200
That is why those who are suffering from cancer

105
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,600
should take to Sahaja Yoga

106
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:34,160
and the ego within you must be got rid of.

107
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,700
Because, wherever there is a government,

108
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,160
ego comes into the people.

109
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,260
We have so many government servants here

110
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,060
and they have a lot of ego within them.

111
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,300
But, it is far more pronounced in the people

112
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,900
who have come from outside. They are like the 'grand fathers'(in negative sense)
114
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,930
to the ones here. And on top of it, they all drink alcohol.

113
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,360
Just imagine they call themselves Christians

114
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,560
and they all drink alcohol.

115
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,530
Therfore by drinking alcohol, you are going against yourself only.

116
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:18,230
You are blocking your own Agnya chakra.

117
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,130
You are compltely ignoring it.

118
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,260
The person whose Agnya chakra is cleared out

119
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,330
he can never drink alcohol.Never ever can have alcohol.

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,330
You find everywhere people drinking alcohol

121
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,400
and neither do they have any means to control it.

122
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,200
Because,whenever they try to overcome 

123
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
they start drinking even more.

124
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,460
So, any kind of'lat'[addiction] drags us to slavery

125
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,130
... of any kind.

126
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,130
Now, these days here you will find addiction to chewing 'paan' (betel-leaves) 

127
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,200
and on top of it, adds tobacco into it.

128
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,560
Just imagine. God has created you with such great love 

129
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,330
in this country, 

130
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,930
so that you could become unique from the rest of the world.

131
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,160
It can happen... and in fact the Indians are an example of that only.

132
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,330
But, now I find a they have developed few more obsessions, 

133
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,560
.Like...  people here prefer to'eat money'rather than eating their 'meals'.
(popular Indian proverb to denote practicing bribery).

134
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,160
Now, for example, the road by which I arrived here

135
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,400
was not there earlier.

136
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,100
It shocked Me immensely to find that they have  

137
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,100
constructed a new road recently. But, none can ever claim the same to be

138
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,260
a newly constructed one. Only the Indians can do such works..

139
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,430
I have never seen such shameless people anywhere else in the world

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,530
who could do such work. After all these are not needed.

141
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,100
Anytime, one who is bigger than the other with riches can do such work.

142
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,460
Therefore, today we need to acertain

143
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,960
in the first place that we must get our Agnya set right.

144
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,100
The greatest thing at the Agnya level is

145
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,300
that we start thinking 'we are the best'

146
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:22,500
and we believe that we can run the world,

147
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,930
we can reform the world.

148
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,360
When you are not all right yourself,

149
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,030
then how can the world be set right?

150
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,430
Well, you must have seen a number of people

151
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,530
who respects and place you in high esteem

152
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,100
and still do a lot of wrong things.

153
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,900
In this country people are corrupt practising bribery [paise khatey hain].

154
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,330
Tell Me how can god ever forgive us.

155
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,330
The worst of all sins are stealing and taking bribe.

156
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,000
The person who does these types of crimes,

157
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,000
you may try anything on him ,even if the person himself may try to do anything, perform pujas,

158
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,330
prayers, chant mantras, recite text from holy scriptures, read namaz, pray in the name of Allah

159
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,200
they will be of no use to him.

160
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,600
Today is your new year.

161
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
I wish you all the best.

162
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,360
And I want you to take a resolution

163
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,630
that from today onwards we will not utter lies. Never, ever you will utter any lies.

164
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,660
I have been to places across the world and 
learnt that Indians are branded as great liars everywhere.

165
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,130
I do not understand why such brandings have come upon our country

166
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,560
that our people are liars.

167
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,900
Where there have been so many great saints and prophets,

168
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,400
so many of them became Sufis,

169
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,700
I wonder how people could speak up so much of lies there.

170
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,930
So you've to promise today

171
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,530
that you will not tell lies

172
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,230
whatever may be the consequences.

173
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,160
For that, you need  courage.

174
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,000
But now that you are realized, what more of 

175
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,660
courage do you require? for that matter You'll can never lie.

176
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,660
Only when you become like that,

177
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,430
people will start believing,

178
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,400
that these people are truthful.

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

180
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,200
In whatever occupation

181
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,260
may be in business or whatever,

182
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,600
he may be an engineer constructing road or a doctor treating people.

183
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,060
Nevertheless,

184
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,360
it can be hell for you if you still lie.

185
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:58,930
Now you have transformed your own self,

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
you are realized now.

187
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,660
So, if the realized people ever lie,

188
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,160
then they can never achieve anything good out of it.

189
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,700
I feel very sad when I have to hear about our country from people outside

190
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,900
that people here (in India) are very dishonest,liars

191
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,030
and make money (illegally).

192
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,530
Today is your very auspicious day.

193
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,300
Today you should all make sure

194
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,560
that we shall never lie, whatever may come.

195
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,460
I am a woman Myself and that too of India.

196
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,330
I have never lied.

197
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,560
By lying, you'll only be at a loss.

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,960
By dishonesty, you'll only be at a loss.

199
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,130
In this manner even if you try to earn a bit more money or adopt other deceitful means 

200
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,430
you will never be able to go to heaven. 

201
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,300
You can only go straight to hell.

202
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,630
It is very important to know

203
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,500
there is a very bad reputation prevailing about us in other countries. 

204
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,060
Why did this bad reputation happen?

205
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,130
Because, we have such kind of people here.

206
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,100
If you come to know that someone is dishonest, then you should form a committee

207
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,960
for him and then question him, “Mister, what do you mean by all these”?

208
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,460
For example, supposing there is a road

209
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,230
that has not been constructed properly,

210
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,100
then try to investigate how much has been spent behind it.

211
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,260
Then watch his actions to see what is he doing.

212
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,160
Making money by such illegal means will 

213
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,760
be spent ultimately towards drinking alcohol only, which is our enemy.

214
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,500
Afterall,why do you want all these?

215
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,360
You already have a very good living,

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,050
but there are many countries where people are poor,

217
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,130
But I found them to be honest.

218
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,330
So, honesty should be the first priority

219
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,000
that needs to be ascertained today.
222
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,230
That we shall not commit dishonesty or

220
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,940
ever be in the company of dishonest people.

221
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,530
Further, if anyone commits it, then we shall expose him.

222
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,800
Now, people often grumbles,

223
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,160
“Mother, similar things happen here also or 
227
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,500
similarly it prevails there also.”

224
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,360
But you are Sahaja Yogis.

225
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,620
Who are Sahaja Yogis,by no means are inferior to a policeman

226
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,960
or any person with a higher status.

227
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,160
They possess great powers within them, but, all those powers come out of truth only.

228
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,200
Truthfulness should be there.

229
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,330
And I am very glad that

230
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,460
a lot of Sahaja Yogis are very truthful.Really Truthful.

231
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,160
But, we require more Sahaja Yogis now 

232
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,100
who can become truthful.

233
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,700
Truthfulness is a very important aspect or else you could never 

234
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,900
get rid of your Agnya. The Agnya is the place where one has 'ego'.

235
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,930
When ego develops in a person 

236
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,930
he commits any offence, 

237
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,300
any sin, criticizes, harms anyone, earns money illegally.

238
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,630
They will all go to hell.

239
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,200
I would like to caution you, that 

240
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,530
you should not earn money illegally.

241
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
It is not that you are dying 

242
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
what have you achieved by earning more 

243
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,230
What are you doing? 

244
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,130
You may have acquired a few lights (bulbs) more

245
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,960
and may have kept of a few more women around- And what more?
250
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,360
But, when you'll go to hell, what will be your condition then? 
251
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,230
I am speaking on this topic on the day of Diwali 

246
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,200
because Diwali was celebrated 

247
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,560
when Sitaji had returned to reunite with Shri Rama.
    
254
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:16,330
Once our character is established,then  we can not remain slaves any more?

248
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,700
We are our own slaves only, not of others even by any means.

249
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,360
You are not to lie for any purpose.

250
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,160
I had been in Delhi for a very long period 

251
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,460
and I was surprised, how much the people lie here.

252
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,400
My goodness – they aren't afraid at all .

253
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,300
Speaking lies so blatantly

254
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,900
probably could help him achieve something, here or

255
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,600
even may help earn a few rupees extra. 

256
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,300
but can never go to heaven.

257
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,160
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise  today onwards, 

258
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,860
'we neither shall ever lie nor ever support the liar .

259
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:07,600
People comment about our country that we are very dishonest.

260
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,630
I have travelled into far remote places 

261
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,900
and I found the people of Russia are  very good.

262
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,630
They are already half-Sahaja Yogis 

263
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,330
and there are so many  Sahaja Yogis too.

264
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,530
I was not able to go to Russia this year.

265
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,400
I shall definitely visit next year.

266
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,840
However, this  makes it clear that

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,680
we can not handle democracy.

268
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,900
We too should have been communist.

269
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,960
Neither there is any stealing,trickery nor any lies spoken in those places 

270
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,260
and they all love each other very much.

271
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,960
There is great respect for Me too.

272
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,500
But, it needs to be understood where are we  leading to after all. (       ^-where are we heading towards?)

273
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,000
Just for the sake of earning a few more (rupees), where are we heading?

274
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,460
What are we going to achieve?

275
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,930
Therefore, to begin with you must be honest. 

276
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,030
Your dishonesty  will cause trouble  to your own people. 

277
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,550
People blame India, claiming that people of this place are very  dishonest.

278
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,900
I am ashamed to hear all this. 

279
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,300
You have had so many great saints 

280
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,330
so many great souls from here

281
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,960
and here the people are frauds

282
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,330
they cheat a lot and also criticize .

283
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,500
So, in the beginning itself your Agnya is scared.

284
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,600
They will become very wealthy.

285
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,430
But, in the end you find that Mr. wealthy is going to hell.

286
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,200
Today, I want to tell you the  

287
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,260
meaning of Diwali is that- 

288
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,330
hell is dark and you have become the light.

289
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,160
It is expected of you that you must fight wherever there is darkness

290
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,200
and make it known publicly that it is wrong.

291
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,130
With this our country is going to improve.

292
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,130
This is yet another job that you have to do.

293
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,160
We are performing puja rituals already.

294
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,700
But,the innate power that is within us is the one

295
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,330
which stands opposed to  all that is untrue.

296
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,930
Many people are obsessed with earning illegal money and do not know

297
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
that directly they will go to hell.

298
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,530
I am telling you all these 

299
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,530
since no one ever spoke about it before.

300
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,960
On this day of Diwali let us say

301
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,000
that we will celebrate the joy 

302
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,660
and light the lamps within our hearts.

303
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,230
In that light we will be able recognize 

304
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,960
who is in what state and who are cheating.

305
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,330
Now,I notice another kind of fight.

306
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,260
Fights between the Hindus and Muslims are  over,

307
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,430
now others have picked up fighting.

308
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,630
It means we are also very quarrelsome.

309
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,330
At least in the other countries 

310
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,330
one does not find religions of so many countries in one place.

311
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,600
But, at the slightest opportunity we pick up  fights here.

312
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,130
Fighting becomes the priority.

313
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,430
Fights between husband and wife, then within their children 

314
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,000
and also amongst them who are in contact with each other.

315
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,500
What is Sahaja Yoga? 

316
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Sahaja Yoga is love. Love.

317
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,030
Awaken that power of love that is within you.

318
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,600
Today is supposed to be a very auspicious day. 

319
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:13,330
We have to light the lamps in our hearts and make it certain by all means

320
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,700
that, even if we have to die, we won’t tell lies.

321
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,000
We already have such people with us.

322
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,000
But, our reputation across the world is so much damaged claiming 

323
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,930
that Indians have become dishonest.

324
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,630
Well, I have never come across one atleast, 

325
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,360
but when discussed, I feel very sad.

326
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,430
A holy place like India 

327
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,160
where great saints had taken their birth 

328
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,530
unlike any other place. Sufis were also born here. 

329
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,700
all those who became great had been from India only.

330
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,060
No other countries ever had so many great souls.

331
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,600
A few may have been there, 

332
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,260
but we have had several great souls here.

333
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:02,262
 

334
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,160
But, later even after ignoring whatever they might have taught us, 

335
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,260
we became branded thieves.

336
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,330
So whoever cheats people they can never ascend to heaven.

337
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,260
Compaired to the lifespan spent here, 

338
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,260
one has to spend a lifespans that is thousand times more in hell.

339
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,060
The reason I am speaking about hell 

340
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,400
on this day is only because hell means the darkness 

341
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,460
and that is the hell that we witness.

342
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,230
Now your lamps are lit. In that light, you must 

343
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,590
recognize the kinds of hell.

344
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,060
You should support the government.

345
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Extend help to identify ,who are dishonest. You may be in a junior or a senior 

346
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,600
position, but you must speak it out 

347
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,330
as to who are the culprits.Catch the culprits.

348
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,630
Expose those who are liars.

349
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,460
Now you have the powers with you – for  what purpose? You are awakened,

350
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,500
for what purpose? You are enlightened. 

351
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,360
In  that light, you must see yourself.

352
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,430
In darkness we acheive nothing, but 

353
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,230
watch in your own light to realize what you are.

354
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,100
Also by lying  what are you going to achieve?  

355
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,300
I am a housewife.I have never lied. Never ever. Neither can ever.

356
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,400
The moment you are compelled to lie, 

357
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,400
you have the powers within, you are all lamps. 

358
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,600
You just see them in this darkness. 

359
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,130
You are the lamps

360
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,560
and the lamps are supposed to give light.

361
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,630
We have to wipe out this darkness.

362
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,460
There is a bad reputation about us from far across.

363
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,500
While the fact is , nowhere else you will ever find people like that of our country.

364
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,500
It gives great pain when I learn 

365
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,360
what misconceptions the people have about us.

366
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,660
God knows what does one achieve by dishonesty?  

367
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,300
But whatever may be the outcome, it is horrible.

368
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,130
No one will be spared.

369
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
Whoever has become dishonest will be caught.

370
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,660
There are all arrangements for that.

371
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,000
You have got your Realization because you are not dishonest.

372
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,460
You love truth and respect the truth.

373
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,930
I want that you should stand on truth.

374
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:51,600
Now for example,people throw garbage into the river Yamuna.It is stupidity.

375
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,960
Yamunaji itself descends directly to hell,

376
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:04,060
but you will be saved from that hell since

377
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,460
you are realized souls.

378
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,130
One who has the light generally do not fall.

379
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:20,230
But, if you sincerly want to establish Sahaja Yoga fully within yourself,  

380
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,130
then in the beginning, you have to swear that you 

381
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,200
will never commit dishonesty of any kind.

382
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,500
It seems earning money has become the only means of business left out in this world.

383
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,230
What does one get out of it? 

384
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,460
Nobody even remembers them.

385
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,600
If you love your country, then at first you must establish the truth 

386
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,530
or else who can trust the liar? 

387
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,160
It is a big hurdle for you 

388
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,660
because you always have a feeling that when my neighbour is like this

389
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,630
then why  I too don't become like that?

390
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,900
But,  why don’t you think instead when I can belike this,

391
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,460
then why not transform my neighbour likewise? 

392
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,460
First of all, today you must promise that we shall neither

393
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,630
commit any dishonesty nor support any dishonest person.

394
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:29,000
Falsehood in our country, not sure why, but

395
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,500
seems like a curse on us.

396
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,030
There are several people who would not be  satisfied until they utter 

397
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,300
at least ten lies from morning until evening.

398
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,900
Now your poverty is finished. Everything is quite all right.

399
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,200
All food and stuff are available.

400
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,360
None of you are beggars, yet why do you lie?  

401
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,700
So let this be the resolution of the day 

402
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,530
that you will not lie any more and, if anyone is a liar then

403
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,960
we shall not join hands to rejoice with that person.

404
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,630
We will have no relationship with him.

405
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,630
There  is plenty of joy in it.

406
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:13,900
Because, do you know that a liar will go to hell

407
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,530
and you too will follow him from behind.

408
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,460
God has given you Realization.

409
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,300
You have the light within and in that light you should identify the 

410
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,060
other like-minded people and then must 

411
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,630
decide that we will not lie whatever may come,

412
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,430
even if we are beheaded.

413
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,060
In these  matters I know the Indians are very good.

414
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,130
But when I hear certain comments about them outside 

415
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,900
then  I feel very sad.

416
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
For example, the road that is constructed, 

417
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,460
does it resemble a road by any means?

418
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,500
I felt if I was travelling in the jungles.

419
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,530
Whenever you come across such a thing, you have 

420
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,460
an organization; you must collectively inquire as to

421
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,900
who were responsible for the construction? Why it had to be constructed that way?

422
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,230
Who had consumed the money? All the Sahaja Yogis should get united 

423
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:29,930
and try focussing your attention in that  direction to drive out the bhoots 

424
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,530
out which have crept into India. Wherever you go,you will hear people commenting:

425
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,500
“Brothers, don’t believe in the Indians." What a shame.

426
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,430
The irony is: in who one should 

427
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,330
trust the most are we Indians only. Nevertheless, we had so many of them 

428
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,060
who were great leaders, great people and great souls.

429
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,460
But we have completely ignored them and their great fame of past. 

430
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,000
How much amount of respect people had for them and also they have for you too – I know that. 

431
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,530
But you should never extend company or support to the cheats.

432
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,330
The moment you realize that a certain person is a cheat, 

433
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,030
then even avoid having meals at his home. 

434
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,300
It will become very difficult for the cheats to survive.

435
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:27,000
I am telling you that 

436
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,600
you  all are the police force of God.

437
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,230
Keep track of all those cheats that you come across. 

438
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,430
Try to instill courage in your children. 

439
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,430
If one is doing something wrong or lying, identify them. 

440
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,460
This country has received blessings alongwith many other saints. 

441
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:57,460
and you all are saints.

442
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,500
There is no need for you to lie.

443
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,360
Well, what's going to happen if you have one time meal only?

444
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,160
Nobody dies if one doesnot have a meal.

445
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,460
We do have food 

446
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,500
but they prefer drink alcohol. 

447
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,060
By drinking alcohol, we take a step further towards our own destruction.

448
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,200
If there is alcohol 

449
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,960
we can never be all right. 

450
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,300
Now for example, in America, 

451
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,030
they always come up with newer subjects, 

452
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,460
Like the moment their children turns sixteen 

453
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,260
they become worthless. Does this mean that  they are all like servants? 

454
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,930
When they work or wash cars they are paid for it. 

455
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,460
And what they claim as they attain the age of sixteen? 

456
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,960
“Well, now that we have turned sixteen and so it is the time to go out for a living.”

457
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,300
I have seen this happening with the 

458
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,200
poor children of sixteen everywhere, 

459
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,300
whereas we (in India) think, “He is just turning sixteen, 

460
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,200
where will he go or What should he study?”

461
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,360
But,(in America) since he has turned sixteen years of age, 

462
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,300
he is driven out of the home both by his mother and father.

463
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,160
Just keep on watching for how long is this going to last with the Americans? 

464
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,000
They are in the state of destruction.

465
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,300
Nobody becomes great by buying one or two airplanes. 

466
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:29,460
Where do you think you are? How far are your limitations?

467
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,530
India is such a country that it can save the entire world

468
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:47,130
 – the entire world. But there should be truthfulness in it. 

469
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:53,300
It is very essential to imbibe the truthfulness. Truthfulness in each and every matter.

470
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,630
I can’t understand, What is the need for nurturing falsehood?

471
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,860
people who are rich should realize in the begining itself that they are already rich. 

472
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,060
So it is better for them to sit back quietly and stop planning to earn anymore. 

473
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,000
I am yet to see Who is happy 

474
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,130
by earning lots of money?

475
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,960
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light within you.

476
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:29,430
In the light you lead other and the path is of truth.

477
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,160
May you be a Muslim, a Hindu or a Christian. It makes no difference. 

478
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,000
You all are humans. And if honesty is missing in a person, 

479
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,430
then he is dishonest. No one will recognize him.

480
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,630
We have to spend lifespan even beyond this also. How will that be?

481
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,300
Through honesty there can be several benefits.

482
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,200
The greatest of all is that 

483
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,000
you have the blessings of God on you.

484
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,430
Blessings come in such a manner that 

485
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,160
you will be astonished to know 

486
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,100
that everything are effortlessly accomplished on its own. 

487
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,300
But now in India, everyone runs after money 

488
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,030
whether they have or donot have.

489
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,260
Yet, there are many poor around. 

490
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,930
That is why today Diwali should be for them also. 

491
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,030
They too should be happy. 

492
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,830
We are citizens of that country. 

493
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,260
But we deceive ourselves only. We pose to be  very clever. 

494
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,230
By this, ego develops within us. And when ego is developed, 

495
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,030
nobody can save by any means. 

496
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,300
With ego, you will develop cancer. 

497
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,030
Therefore you will not be able to save yourself 

498
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,160
if you develop cancer. You cannot save yourself. 

499
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
I cannot save you. I am telling you the truth.

500
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,930
So, first of all , you should burn the ego in fire that you possess within . 

501
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,900
If you have ego then you must be ashamed of it. 

502
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,160
“Ego for what"? 

503
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,060
It is prevelent for everything in our country . 

504
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,560
Someone passes a Bachelor degree examination,  he develops ego. 

505
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,000
Achieving someother  qualification higher than that gives him double ego.

506
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,000
One achieves something, 

507
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,000
becomes an engineer or a doctor, 

508
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,030
he develops ego. 

509
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,530
Thus, when this Agnya chakra gets caught, 

510
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,030
where does it ultimately lead you to? To hell.

511
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,160
And hell is a very horrible place. 

512
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,560
God has blessed you with intelligence 

513
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,130
and now you have got your Realization. 

514
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,360
Still if you want to go to the hell, you can go. 

515
00:37:00,200 --> 00:38:05,030
It is only when you remain honest and 

516
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,360
Until this day nobody spoke about it or told you.

517
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,000
Today is the day that is considered auspicious 

518
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,500
because several good things happened. 

519
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,100
During the period of Ramachandraji, Sitaji returned home. 

520
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:27,960
During Krishna’s times and several other occasion that were marked by great events 
527
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,630
were all worked out by the realized souls.

521
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,260
That is why, in the first place, you must take a vow today that 

522
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,900
“We will not commit any dishonesty for sure 

523
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,130
and if anyone does, then we shall ensure 

524
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,400
that he is caught.” 

525
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,000
But I notice that in this country the blacks are at war with the whites 

526
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,430
any one picking up fight with the other. 

527
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,360
They want to divide India into fragments. 

528
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,100
It is not going to benefit anyway. But how is it going to benefit? 

529
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,130
you possess a good moral character.

530
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,030
Whatever you have learnt from the English, 

531
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,230
there was nothing worth learning from them.

532
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,930
They are all in a bad state these days. 

533
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,500
But we have to save our own country 

534
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,560
and also to save the entire world. It is a great responsibility.

535
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,800
You have been realized and the light has come within you. 

536
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,160
Yet, you want to jump into the ditch,what can anyone do? 

537
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,000
Everyone should join together to make an effort.

538
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,260
I want the Sahaja Yogis should constitute a committee. 

539
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,200
In case you come across any cheating, 

540
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,230
you should report it to the committee. 

541
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,400
Then let us see what the committee does. 

542
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,300
In this way, you'll earn a good name. 

543
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,000
In this way, you will be elevated to higher positions.

544
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,230
So, in the first place neither you be a dishonest yourself

545
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,360
nor let any other be. 

546
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,030
This is very important for you have  

547
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,530
great blemish on your country. 

548
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,360
There is adulteration in the edible oil, 

549
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,030
adulteration in the ghee. 

550
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,300
Everywhere  people make a mockery at us. 
559
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,260
No one has faith in us. 

551
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,700
In fact, the best of the people are in India. 

552
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:40,630
Nowhere you find so many people 

553
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:40,700
who have had their realization. 

554
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,500
They have not earned any sort of punyas(virtues/spiritual merits). 

555
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,930
Therefore, it is nobler to earn punyas than to earn money.

556
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,430
Look at those people who are very poor.

557
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,400
So today is a very auspicious day and also a day of joy. 

558
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:08,060
Joy for what? Because on this day we have been blessed 

559
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,430
with heaven and we desire to be in heaven only. 

560
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,360
But cowards can never make it to heaven. 

561
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,700
There is no need to be afraid.

562
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,460
Well, what diaster is going to come even if you earn 

563
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,530
a few paise(Indian currency coin) less or more? 

564
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,160
All of you have become rich. I can see that is quite visible and 

565
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,900
I have been coming here(Delhi) for the past 17 or 18 years now. 

566
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,360
All of you have become richer than before. 

567
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,200
Conditions have improved now compared to earlier. 

568
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,700
But, from morning until evening there is 

569
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

570
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,750
So, the path is now laid down before you. therefore,just promise today 

571
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,000
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and, if anyone is found doing  

572
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,660
then we shall collectively oppose him.

573
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,460
Why did Sahaja Yoga 

574
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,700
give you Realization? 

575
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,160
It is because you will emit light. 

576
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,120
If you do not posses light within, then how can you emit light outside? 

577
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,360
In that light try to see for yourself whether you are helping the dishonest? 

578
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,260
Nothing happens if you earn a little less or more. 

579
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:30,060
If you are honest, then God helps you. 
589
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,550
Now , you see for yourself , I never take money from anyone.It is true.

580
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,980
But, I wrote a book

581
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,770
and received lots of money from it.

582
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,900
I shall neither allow anyone to take anything.

583
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,500
Why do so many people die in our country 

584
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:54,060
compared to anywhere else? 

585
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,900
The reason is because people want to go to hell.

586
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,600
So, you should know this, that if you commit dishonesty, 

587
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,860
then your first step have already been established in hell 

588
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,660
and secondly you don’t need to utter lies at all. 

589
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,000
You must speak the truth. 

590
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:24,030
The man who speaks the truth becomes a unique person. 

591
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:30,130
If he practises Sahaja Yoga, then it can be remarkable. 

592
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,380
As you are remembering the Sufis today, 

593
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,930
similarly people will remember you then. 

594
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,710
You don’t need to do anything  

595
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,310
only expose those who are dishonest. 

596
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,340
It is important.

597
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,000
Here the people are querreling... 

598
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,940
"Don't throw garbage into the Yamunaji and 

599
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,210
don’t throw that". Now, do this also needs to be told. 

600
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,010
I have been to so many countries. 

601
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,150
Nowhere the waste is disposed into any river. 

602
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,640
Then why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities made available. 

603
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:13,420
You can hand it over to the municipality or dispose it elsewhere. 

604
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,700
But if you are accumulating the waste yourself, 

605
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,950
then what can you do?

606
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,250
All of you should think in your mind and decide today. 

607
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,810
It is a very good day today. It is a good day. 

608
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:34,640
That neither  shall we ever commit any dishonesty nor acknowledge the dishonest. 

609
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,820
I have seen such people 

610
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,260
who neither had been dishonest nor ever visited the house 

611
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,050
of any dishonest person. They never kept any connection with them. 

612
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:48,910
because they not only harmed themselves 
623
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,800
but had also been harmful for the nation..

613
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,200
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. 

614
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,280
You should promise that

615
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,360
we shall never commit any dishonesty. 

616
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,280
And if some one happens to be dishonest 

617
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,480
then you must beat him collectively.Don't worry.

618
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:23,130
For that you need not think "why to beat him, there is government to look after".

619
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,840
It doesn't matter.

620
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,310
You have to recognize only who are dishonest

621
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:38,010
and tell it to your inner Sprit that he is dishonest.

622
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,910
And for the Sahaja Yogis – even if 12 Sahaja Yogis can unite and collectively

623
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,750
identify that this particular person is dishonest, 

624
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,210
then God is with you. 

625
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,250
Merely by a handful of rich people the welfare of  the country cannot improve.
637
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,110
But with honest people, certainly it can.
638
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,750
So, the greatest blemish on us is 

626
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,650
that 'we are dishonest'. 

627
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:18,710
- What? - (inturruption addressing Sir CP) 

628
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,060
And those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest by any means. 

629
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,580
This is My belief. 

630
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:39,750
We all need to be united. 

631
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,940
Leave aside all differences. 

632
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:48,820
We are all honest people, India’s reputation is greatly tarnished. 

633
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,210
That is why take a vow from today 

634
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,050
that we shall not commit any dishonesty and if there are 

635
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,450
any other dishonest person, we shall collectively chase after him. 

636
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,930
He is sure to experience a sleepless night the next day itself. 

637
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,350
Nevertheless, it has gone too far. 

638
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,780
Now I've to tell you that I am astonished. 

639
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,280
There is dishonesty in everything – dishonesty in everything. 

640
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,890
Where ever you notice any dishonesty,

641
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,700
Sahaja yogis should unite in group of ten to beat him.

642
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,010
I am with you!

643
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,880
In the earlier days people used to outcast others on petty matters. 

644
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,040
- 'What's the matter'?(Interruption...Mother discussing aside).

645
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,380
They used to outcast

646
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,870
and boycott on every minute issue. 

647
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:05,700
But, our country had remained so honest and 

648
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,680
had such great qualities.Why have we forgotten them? 

649
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,850
Where have they all gone? 

650
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,910
I find there is dishonesty everywhere. Dishonesty at every step.

651
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,600
If you notice anyone practsing dishonesty  - then go and beat him.

652
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:36,670
But it doesn't mean that you beat every other person who comes your way.It doesnot mean that.

653
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,410
You must teach the children here that they should not become dishonest. 

654
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,180
In case they are dying of starvation

655
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,450
then  arrangements could be made suitably,

656
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,250
provided they are honest. 

657
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:06,010
But if honesty is not there,leave alone God, 

658
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,810
no one is going to help you. All kinds of diseases will come upon you.

659
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:14,280
Coincidently, our country is full of such remarkable traditions, they are countless...

660
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,910
For example, they will drink alcohol,liquor just imagine! 

661
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:27,380
Were you born to become a stupid? 

662
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:33,990
Stop being friendly to the person, who does it. Don’t support him. 

663
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,520
I have noticed that people who

664
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,850
drink alcohol,people visit their houses and 

665
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,810
they also join in drinking alcohol. But if you come to know 

666
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,680
that a person is of such nature...  

667
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,350
or a particular person is dishonest, then stop having meals in his house. 

668
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:57,650
You should not have any concern (for them).

669
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,450
We have to work for the betterment of our country 

670
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,710
because god has given us the light.You must judge in that light. 

671
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,710
His powers are tremendous. 

672
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:15,850
If you are able to realize that those who had been dishonest 

673
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:21,030
to the nation will be taken care of by God.That will work out everything. It is enough. 

674
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:26,210
But, you seem to have turn deaf and refuse to understand. 

675
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:29,680
Such people neither can ever do good 

676
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,480
nor can ever deliver. 

677
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:38,550
I don’t understand how do those shameless people exist? I really donot know.

678
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,120
But, they do exist.

679
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,150
For that reason, today's message for you is

680
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,910
that you must vow on this day onwards 

681
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,590
that we shall never ever commit any dishonesty 

682
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,030
and if someone is dishonest, then we shall not support him. 

683
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,720
That is enough. 

684
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:21,970
Many more realized souls will come to our country. 

685
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,970
But, who would like to be born in such a dishonest country like this?

686
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,350
The only message for you today is that you have the light within 

687
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,450
and you have carry forward your mission in that light

688
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,130
that is going to provide you the strength. 

689
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,810
Whatever you wish to do, you are welcome.

690
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,150
Look, we have achieved our 'swatantrata'. 

691
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,750
'Swa'-'tantra'...try to know the 'swa'(ownSelf).

692
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:10,810
It's for you...( inturruptions- in-betweenlittle child hands over flowers to Mother)

693
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,220
Now, I want that many children to be born. They should be realized. 

694
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:28,780
That is why you must learn in the begining..... 

695
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,510
Today is a great day.

696
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:44,340
You must promise today that neither will we commit any dishonesty nor be involved with the dishonest persons. 

697
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,470
or be afraid of them. 

698
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,580
God is never with them. God is with you. 

699
00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:02,820
If you are good, then God is with you. 

700
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,110
Everyone of you were born in this land of India, it indeed wasn't for the sake of 

701
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,850
fighting amongst each other to die. 

702
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:17,130
Ignorant fools, we fight each other and then die. 

703
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,850
There is no use in fighting, you should tell this to people.

704
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,990
“Well, what are you fighting for ? 

705
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,770
What do you want? Why? After all, what do you want? 

706
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,250
There is enough to eat and drink. What more do you want?” 

707
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,700
But, nowadays the demands are like , 

708
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,410
“I need that dress, I want such kind of house 

709
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,210
and not this type.” 

710
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,630
And with all those, let's go to hell.

711
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,860
At this moment...(Inturrupted by Sir CP and speaking to Sir CP)

712
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:02,280
(Sir) OK, enough, that'll do.

713
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,060
- No-no, Its all fine......

714
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,910
Like those who had become Sufis, you are all Sufis too

715
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,520
because you have been cleansed. 

716
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,630
Now all of you should write poems – on honesty. 

717
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,950
This element of dishonesty needs to go in the first place 

718
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:49,340
and secondly, there are many issues that need to be taken care of. 

719
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:54,130
But first of all, never commit dishonesty. 

720
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:59,600
No one is that poor in India 

721
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,340
that he needs to take to dishonesty.

722
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,640
- What?(speaking aside)

723
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:14,780
What I am saying is, there is a blemish on our country and it needs to be wiped out.

724
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,700
And you are Sahaja Yogis. You can do it. 

725
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,490
You have the light with you. With it 

726
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,810
you can spread the light everywhere.

727
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:34,930
You must encourage everyone to show the  right things.

728
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,260
Those young amongst you, who are friends 

729
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,680
should think what honestful work they can undertake. 

730
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,700
Now a campaign is initiated  to prohibit dumping anything into River Yamunaj. 

731
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:51,760
That is all right, but it is not as important. 

732
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:54,290
More important aspect is losing one's honesty. 

733
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:01,270
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere. 

734
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,330
Lamps are lit at all the places. 

735
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:09,650
Everything is done and if we can’t do this bit,

736
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,370
then there is no use being a sahaj yogi.

737
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:22,430
We have the  largest collectivity of Sahaja Yogis in India – the largest collectivity. 

738
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,650
Next to it is in Russia. 

739
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,180
Now, the Russians are very humble. 

740
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,290
they dont steal or cheat

741
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,530
I really don’t understand how? 

742
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,810
Maybe if communism comes here,probably 

743
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,750
we too would become like them. 

744
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,820
But it does not make very big sense. 

745
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,930
It is not good to impose compulsion to achieve anything.. 

746
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,160
Let us impose strictness on ourselves. 

747
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,930
Decide it for good. Take up the resolution today only. 

748
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,190
Today is a very good day to start, 

749
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:09,370
that neither shall we commit any dishonesty nor let others commit it.

750
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:17,750
Your country will become very prosperous. 

751
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,340
And after all what is any other country? I have seen all of them. 

752
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,270
All are useless people. 

753
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:32,780
But,people of our country still have a lot of dharma(righteousness) in them.

754
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,080
The dharma in our country has been destroyed

755
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,010
since the dishonest became all the very powerful. 

756
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:50,140
Try to find out whether someone is dishonest and then make advances for picketting on him.

757
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,130
You are so many, you must gather together for picketting on him.

758
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,530
- What..?(Mother speaking aside)

759
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,050
and that would make a lot of difference.

760
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,420
- Haan!, Well , better you don't interrupt me in-between... (speaking to Sir CP)

761
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,080
So the only  message today is 

762
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:25,790
that neither we shall ever commit dishonesty nor allow anyothers to commit.

763
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,580
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter. 

764
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,970
They tolerate. This is the greatest mistake. 

765
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,980
When you have got the light, then why do you fear?

766
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,710
What is the reason for you to be afraid? 

767
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:53,650
That is why I am requesting you today to do everything with courage.

768
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,780
And now you have got a kind of swatantrata (freedom). 

769
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,440
You will attain (knowledge) the tantra (the system) of the swa (Self). 

770
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,300
You have already attained it, 

771
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:08,180
but try to make use of it.

772
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,810
Today so many of you have gathered here. 

773
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,950
I had never seen so many in Delhi before. 

774
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:29,570
Therefore,today every one of you must decide in mind   
788
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:34,310
that we will not accept any dishonest person at all.And the rakshasas too incarnate at this time due to these reasons. 

775
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,810
Doesn't it go to show that we too have certain weaknesses within. 

776
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,780
That 's why  they believe that the weaknesses within us, 

777
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:46,150
will ultimately compel us to accept them. 

778
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,950
Indians should never accept them. 

779
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:57,880
Besides the persons who have received their Realization , should never ever accept them.

780
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,160
There is a bad reputation about our country everywhere. 

781
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,560
But this is not true. 

782
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,950
There are several persons in India who are honest – in great number. 

783
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,810
Nevertheless, it is not true 

784
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:14,780
but I have seen it Myself that 

785
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:22,310
they will quarrel amongst each other saying,“This land is mine and that land is yours.” 

786
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,910
Well whatever is yours is 'Swaraj'. 

787
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,750
It is the 'rajya' (kingdom) of the 'swa' (Self). 

788
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,410
Swaraj can only happen  

789
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:36,680
when you really become 'swatantra' in the true sense. 

790
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:45,010
There is no need to be afraid of anyone. There is no need to tell anything to anyone.

791
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:52,110
I am astonished to see so many people. 

792
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,310
I had never seen so many people in My life. 

793
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:10,930
So, I have only one request to you and that is today, 

794
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,660
on this occasion of a very auspicious day, 

795
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:16,520
decide that we shall never commit dishonesty even if we have to die. 

796
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:25,970
secondly,if there is any dishonest, then collectively take care of him. 

797
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:33,750
By the way I told you all these things. But it seems the government is not able to do anything.

798
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,850
In the  last 10 years our country deteriorated a lot . 

799
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:47,050
You all are  Sahaja Yogis and  so many in numbers. Who are you all afraid of? 

800
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,650
What is the reason to fear? 

801
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:58,230
God is there behind everyone, to support. 

802
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:08,730
Just see for yourself, as soon as the Sufis realized  

803
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,350
that God was behind them, 

804
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,520
they got rid of all those unwanted things that were around them 

805
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,110
– not all, but a few of the sufis. 

806
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,150
That is what  you all should do.

807
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:29,550
In My opinion, the only message for today is that 

808
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,910
now  neither you are a cheat yourself, nor will help any cheat. 

809
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,900
I have been reading in the papers that 

810
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:45,300
there are differences over several other issues. 

811
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,010
Differences are over the caste and creed. 

812
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:55,530
Well, are your efforts for protecting the country or for drowning ? 

813
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,250
You have a great responsibility on you.

814
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,730
You are born in the Kali Yuga. 

815
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:06,830
That is why this Kali Yuga is to be transformed 

816
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,910
and you are all realized in the thousands. 

817
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,980
Nowhere else have so many people been realized on Earth. 

818
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:21,170
That is why time and again I shall be repeating to you 

819
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,940
to stand on truth. I am with you. 

820
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:39,180
And God is also with you.

821
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,850
I was never worried about money.

822
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:52,350
I've lived without money only, I don't need them.

823
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,730
I have so many children, what shall I do with money?

824
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:13,900
So I have a request to you all today to assert within yourself 

825
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:18,620
that we shall not allow any offences like cheating or stealing to happen. 

826
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,670
Wherever we come to know of it, we will fight it out there. 

827
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:29,590
I do not know what the people achieve by drinking alcohol or doing what?

828
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:40,100
But in this light what do you receive? It is 'Courage'!  

829
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,760
so fight with courage!

830
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:46,220
Whatever are wrong with this country should be removed.

831
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,810
It has earned a very bad reputation. 

832
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:55,150
There are many more issues, 

833
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,310
but the most important one is that when there is no honesty at all, 

834
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,180
how is God going to help you? 

835
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:08,030
To earn money is not the help from God, but to be established in dharma is.

836
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:14,420
There aren’t as many Sahaja Yogis anywhere else as you find here. 

837
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,810
Further,Sahaja Yogis never involve themselves doing such activities also. 

838
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,360
But I am telling you all this because 

839
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,060
the atmosphere here is bad. 

840
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:32,110
Over and above we have earned such a bad name all over.

841
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,090
You have everything with you - food to eat and drink, clothes to wear. 

842
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,560
What else do you need? 

843
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:50,200
You may enjoy movies, you enjoy that, you do have that much money. 

844
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:57,380
But first of all, the obsession for the money should be got rid of.

845
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:05,100
I have full faith in you that you will listen to My today's lecture carefully. 

846
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:11,220
And let us take an oath today

847
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:18,400
that we shall not commit dishonesty at all, also will oppose them who commits.  

848
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:36,090
The most important message that is to be understood 

849
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:41,680
is that today our country needs honesty . 

850
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:48,190
Nothing is more important than that. Your Mother stands for honesty.

851
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:56,440
Fighting against Muslims,fighting with others, Ther is no need to fight with anybody.

852
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:05,090
Let us fight within ourselves with us. That is all.

853
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,150
All are good.

854
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:12,140
So what if you have only one shirt instead of ten? 

855
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,730
Likewise convince these things to women also.

856
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,380
It will work out.... It will happen.

857
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:28,410
Today’s speech is a little bit different. It is unique... 

858
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:34,480
and you all have liked it. It was very kind of you. 

859
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:58,740
Let's go.

860
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,010
Well then, thank you.
