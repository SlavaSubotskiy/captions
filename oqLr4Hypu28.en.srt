1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,000
in one of my lectures

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,800
i have talked to you about the emotional

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
intelligence

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,279
that is what we should try to invite

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,239
emotional intelligence that means

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
the intelligence that is based on

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,800
emotions

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
unless and until we become emotionally

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,039
intelligent

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,440
our society cannot

11
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,719
emotional intelligence you care

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,840
and you enjoy caring

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,840
you do everything

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,800
for others with a great

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,600
emotional understanding not for one

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
child

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,240
not for one son but for everyone

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,000
you have to be emotionally intended

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,400
some children are born like this but

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,960
some are to be made like that

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
that they should be emotionally internal

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,040
because if the mother and father

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,159
are money oriented very selfish

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,680
they won't allow their child

25
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,640
to give anything to others so such a

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,640
child will grow

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,600
into a very funny type of a person

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,759
and will never do anything for anybody

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,640
not even for his own country

30
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,720
why should he do it everything for

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,560
selfishness

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,840
then such people indulge into corruption

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
indulge into all kinds of things which

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,880
are

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
only selfish in attitude

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,800
now we are talking of collectivity

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,720
in collectivity we do for others

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,080
we enjoy doing for others we love giving

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
things to others

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
not for our yourself because your

41
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
children will also

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,599
become the same kind and they'll only

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
bother about themselves

44
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,680
this emotional intelligence has to be

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,120
brought in our life in our pattern

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,879
that we have are we emotionally

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,560
intelligent or we are just

48
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,959
intelligent or emotional

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,840
both things are wrong if you are just

50
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
intelligent you can become very dry

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,040
person

52
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,879
you may just have few friends maybe you

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
may not have

54
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,280
and you will always try to preserve

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,319
yourself away

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,400
from the collectivity

57
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,920
and if you are emotional you will be

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
attached only to one person

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,239
attached to one child maybe attached to

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,080
one person

61
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,640
to someone even in the society

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
for no rhyme and reason why why are you

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
attached to one person

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,760
why are you bothered about one person

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
only

66
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
all such people fall into such terrible

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
praying

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,799
in the politics you have seen how people

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
try to help their own sons and our

70
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,000
daughters and

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
this and that and we indians have

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,840
suffered a lot with this

73
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,840
kind of a emotional attachment

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,799
so according to

75
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,840
ethics emotional

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
intelligence is the highest quality

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,040
by which you give to others

78
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,720
you care for others for everybody

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
and you become very very collected

80
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,560
now exclusiveness is another fashion

81
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,800
that's very much that it's exclusive

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
because you don't want to be one of the

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
multitudes you want to be

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:39,040
exclusive you should be

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:42,000
exclusive in emotional intelligence

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
not on other things that is the best

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
thing

88
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,199
you can have as i agree i am just a

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,280
woman

90
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,840
i'm just a mother but what i have

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,919
is really the emotional

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,039
intelligence ocean of it

93
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,919
and from that i know

94
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,919
about everyone

95
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
i understand about a book and all this

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
work has been done

97
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,800
because of that quality in my head

98
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:21,199
i am not attached to one person or to

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,639
one style whatever you say

100
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,440
i can understand because i am at a level

101
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,600
where i can understand everything that

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,360
you are doing

103
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,479
to achieve that you try to develop

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
emotional intelligence here the children

105
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,280
won't even

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,280
give a toy for somebody to play

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,759
even the mother is like that the father

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,080
is like that extremely selfish

109
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,120
and we must have our own say everything

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,000
should be our own

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
this has to go this has to go from

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,639
american

113
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,880
especially because they are the leading

114
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:08,720
nation in this kind of selfishness

115
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,199
what selfishness they have done i did

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,360
not count but you know that

117
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,639
you go and ask the people of canada

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,919
mexico

119
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,520
peru all this they will tell

120
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:25,600
being selfish they are not ashamed

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
they are exploiters they are not ashamed

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,520
nobody can even tell them because they

123
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,800
think they are very rich people

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,600
but all these riches will not give him

125
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,800
the joy

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:46,080
of life joy of life is only in

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,720
the emotional intelligence

128
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
if you don't have that it becomes very

129
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
dry

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,919
life becomes very hot unbearable

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
horrible

132
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,479
and even the family

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,360
gets broken up if there is no emotional

134
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,800
intelligence in the family

135
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,800
i have known so many women who have

136
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,319
had three marriages five marriages i

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
don't know how they can do it

138
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,240
but they have done because this lack of

139
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,919
emotional interest

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,000
it is something that is a sense of

141
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,639
giving

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
it is not that you are sacrificing

143
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,560
anything no

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,000
that's also another idea that we have to

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,000
bear these nothing of the color

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
look at the life of christ he gave his

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,039
life

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,160
why what was the need for him to do that

149
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,639
behind it was the truth

150
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
when you have truth with you the light

151
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,599
of the truth the force of the truth the

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
strength of the

153
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,879
truth you become emotionally

154
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,759
intelligent you understand

155
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
that if you really love something then

156
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,840
you

157
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,039
have to undergo every kind

158
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,919
of trouble you have to tolerate a lot of

159
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,160
nausea

160
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
i know it's too much to say but i

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
thought that

162
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:16,879
for the special puja i should

163
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:21,199
say something about the sound

164
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,400
in our ashrams or in our programs

165
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,650
or wherever we are we should remember

166
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
this point that are we

167
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,599
[Music]

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,519
having that emotional intelligence when

169
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,519
we are trying to talk about sahaja yoga

170
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,200
why do i need to be every place to tell

171
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
them

172
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,320
what is the need you can tell them

173
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,600
if you have that emotional intelligence

174
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,920
everybody will listen to you why not not

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
necessarily i should go everywhere

176
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
and talk to them how many countries can

177
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480
i do

178
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
and the reaction to it's so beautiful

179
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,320
and so

180
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,880
nice it's very surprising like in a

181
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
country like benin country almost lives

182
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,160
there

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,600
all black people they all have become

184
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,320
sahaja yogis

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
nine thousand

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,360
how could i capture that just think of

187
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,959
that

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,560
nine thousand people summative then

189
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,480
also other countries have seen just

190
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
this is the power of emotional

191
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,680
intelligence

192
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,800
that captures the heart of the people

193
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,880
you may have any amount of property

194
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,440
money everything people will abhor

195
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
all right so you may say what's wrong

196
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,839
what's wrong with this

197
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:53,040
that you are harming the greatest

198
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,040
thing is the human being

199
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,279
and the politicians they are horrible as

200
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,519
they say

201
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,600
why because they have no emotional

202
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,040
intelligence

203
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,240
also as administrators

204
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
they are very much difficult

205
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
because they have no emotional

206
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
intelligence

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,959
all these people are devoid of that

208
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,600
great quality of emotional intelligence

209
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,399
if your country is very progressive i

210
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,399
must say

211
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
you must progress in emotional

212
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,959
intelligence

213
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,079
that way they are philosophized i know

214
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
americans are known to be

215
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:38,880
philanthropists but behind that

216
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,880
is they want to have power

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,120
they want to rule people with that money

218
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,120
it's not emotional uh intelligence is

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,120
they just want to rule

220
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,160
if they start some sort of a charity

221
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,360
that is just to have a big name on the

222
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,480
television

223
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,839
or to have a very big

224
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,600
advertisement about oh yeah and then he

225
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,600
moves like a tycoon all over

226
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,160
we part of it they will donate be part

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,959
of their property

228
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,680
work it out and make such a fuss about

229
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
it

230
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,920
because they want to cash it everything

231
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,959
cash has been given so cash flow

232
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,959
you are sahaja yogi

233
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,440
you have to send waves of emotional

234
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,720
intelligence

235
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
you have to send love to all over the

236
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
world

237
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,959
you have to show how you can eat love

238
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,920
whenever

239
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,360
it is also possible if you are not so

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,160
attached

241
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
if you are attacked say to your country

242
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,519
only

243
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,480
now this is a bigger issue then you will

244
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,279
try

245
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,880
to exploit other countries take

246
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,440
advantage of them

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,680
try to run them down but if you are

248
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
emotionally attached to your country

249
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,959
then you will bring good name to your

250
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,560
country by doing

251
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:10,000
real good work i don't know why

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,480
people do not know how to discriminate

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
why are they so selfish trying to build

254
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,720
them up

255
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,000
trying to do all the

256
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,000
good things for themselves

257
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,079
there is a very great chance for all of

258
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,959
you

259
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,760
to get this within you your reach

260
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,800
because you are

261
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,160
all sahaja yogis you have become like

262
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,399
lotuses

263
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,880
and the lotus has the fragrance which

264
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,279
spreads all over

265
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,200
and days together it stays in the water

266
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,560
in that dirty water

267
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,160
and it spreads the fragrance with that

268
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,279
fragrance also you can do

269
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,720
lots of things that the bees come there

270
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,000
they sleep in that

271
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,959
beautiful house of a lotus

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,240
and in the night it closes down very

273
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,720
carefully

274
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:12,000
all kinds of things that come

275
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,000
for the flower to take the

276
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:24,880
little of the

277
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:28,800
beauty of that flower we can say because

278
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,360
you can extract also the essence of that

279
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
which has

280
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,680
fragrance you can

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,800

282
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,000
is possible

283
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,720
everybody comes to that flower

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,519
that doesn't mean that flower in any way

285
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
is weak

286
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,839
but that's his quality that's his

287
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
strength that's his understanding

288
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,760
that's what you are you are all made

289
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,839
into lotuses

290
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
you are not made into some sort of

291
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,480
creeps

292
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,839

and you should feel happy about it that

298
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839

299
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
that you give up this give up that

300
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,079
