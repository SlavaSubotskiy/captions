1
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:14,741
I am happy to know so many of you have come
here and I feel this is a very important puja,

2
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:20,620
not only for Australia but for the whole world,
because it has the greatest message which

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,631
we have actualized now in Sahaja yoga.

4
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:30,371
We have to understand the message of Christ.

5
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:35,691
There are many people in this world who try
to show off that they are very great rationalists

6
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:43,291
and that they have a right to pass any remark
they like about Christ.

7
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,091
I was reading the newspapers today.

8
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:57,751
I was surprised where they are all saying
one by one that, "I reject this part of Christ

9
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,391
that He was born with Immaculate Conception.

10
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,031
I reject that He was resurrected.

11
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,900
I reject this and I reject that."

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,580
Who are you?

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:18,441
Because you can write, because you have a
flair, how can you say such things?

14
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,311
Just without finding out.

15
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:25,571
You are a scholar, maybe you are very well
read, maybe that you think you are capable

16
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:34,501
of saying whatever you like about any subject,
but subject of spirituality cannot be dealt

17
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:39,401
by people who are not even self-realized.

18
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:45,921
Because it's a very divine life, it's a very
different life.

19
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:52,660
It's a area where your mind cannot enter.

20
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,841
It is beyond the mind.

21
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:06,481
And so the poets or artists, all of them who
have worked on Christ's life and have tried

22
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:13,921
to say things about Him, mostly were realized
souls and if they were not, they could not

23
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,881
do any justice to His life.

24
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:25,350
It's very surprising that I should be celebrating
this resurrection in Australia.

25
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:38,951
You know this is the country of mooladhara,
and mooladhara itself then expresses itself

26
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,411
or manifests in the agnya.

27
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:58,831
So, such a great connection you have that
first of all is the country where mooladhara

28
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:05,731
is established, was established I should say,
and later on that it was manifested in the

29
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:11,261
life of Christ on the agnya center.

30
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:21,411
I must say that you have really created some
very great people signifying this beautiful

31
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:30,740
manifestation because, as you have Dr. Bogdan
who is an Australian, in the sense that he

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:40,381
lived here and then he went back to Russia
which is the right agnya, where he worked.

33
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:49,291
In the same way, as Sahaja yoga has prospered
here to begin with, among all the European

34
00:03:49,291 --> 00:04:08,031
countries, or we can say, among all the countries
which were not Indian, maximum growth took

35
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:17,621
place in Australia and the maximum growth
now first took place in the Eastern Bloc,

36
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:18,621
in Russia.

37
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:25,681
Now the other part of the agnya is China.

38
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:35,151
And it is you people only... out of you only
some people have to look after that.

39
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:46,350
And as it is you're all looking after Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand.

40
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:54,640
All these are Chinese races.

41
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,760
Apart from that, they worship Buddha.

42
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,640
It's very interesting.

43
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:09,510
Buddha, as you know, is on the left side of
your medha, as they call it, this is the medha

44
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,271
plate, is the lower plate of the brain.

45
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:21,480
So the Christ is in the center and we've got
Buddha on the left side.

46
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,010
Or, you also are looking after the countries
which are influenced by Buddha.

47
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,950
It's all working out like a plan.

48
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:43,991
Perhaps you're not aware of it, that we are
all people belonging to one Virata and that

49
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:54,060
our needs or our work, all of them have great
significance and connection.

50
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:08,271
About Australia, there's a myth in India that
there was a big saint and he was very good,

51
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:15,151
but somehow he made some mistakes... or maybe
lots of mistakes.

52
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:19,620
So God cursed him and said you better go away
from India.

53
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,000
It was connecting India and Africa.

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,961
So the land was brought down to this point.

55
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:34,241
He gave him the land - God - and He said,
"Now you resurrect this land and make something

56
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,901
out of it."

57
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:43,521
And this star is called as this Trishanku
[MEANS As per Indian Mythology, a saint king

58
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,611
who wished to go to heaven alive, but was
stopped & kept hanging in between by Gods,

59
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:47,831
as he was being sent by Sage Vishwamitra,
and then became a star], which is your Southern

60
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:48,831
Cross.

61
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,000
This Southern Cross is called as Trishanku,
as in... mentioned in our Puranas [MEANS One

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,720
type of Indian scriptures] as this saint who
became like that and God made him into a star

63
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
which is hanging.

64
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:15,831
Trishanku is hanging on top of this land and
is working out the building up of this country.

65
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:23,161
He was told that you go there and make a heaven
for the human beings.

66
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:35,090
This has so many mythological and historical
backgrounds.

67
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,140
And there are some very good points also I
have seen about Australia, which are very

68
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,850
surprising because they believe in the multi-racial
society and they preserve it.

69
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:56,861
They try to help the people through justice
if some people are troubled and tortured.

70
00:07:56,861 --> 00:08:04,560
It's a very bold attitude towards progress
that we should have multicultural society

71
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:15,170
and this comes, again I would say, after resurrection
of political thought.

72
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:28,321
America is multicultural society, full of
it, and as a result of that, as a result of

73
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:33,781
that they have progressed very much financially.

74
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:42,820
But they didn't learn anything from the multicultural
society.

75
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,261
For example, Spanish went there.

76
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,991
Spanish, as you know, are bullfighters.

77
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:58,091
They went and destroyed all the cultures of
the ancient times and the new people who have

78
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:01,421
gone, they don't have any rapport with them.

79
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:09,141
Like Indians have a separate identity, then
we have other cultures like Islamic and all

80
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:13,121
that, so they don't keep any connection with
them.

81
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:21,221
The original aboriginals are also kept out
as something very low-level.

82
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:29,830
But here I find people have a curiosity and
also knowledge about the other cultures which

83
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,001
are around them.

84
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:44,371
That shows the sense of collectivity is within
your genes, we can say, that it is working

85
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:54,020
out in such a way that this country believes
still in the multicultural society.

86
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,411
All these are manifestation of Shri Ganesha's
quality.

87
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:10,190
See if you have, say, a group of even ten
people with husband and wife and they don't

88
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:20,150
have the purity of Shri Ganesha, they cannot
exist because there will be always a very

89
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,381
great conflict between husband and wife.

90
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:31,820
Also, not only the conflict part, but people
will become extremely superficial.

91
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:42,320
Like, in America a woman would marry a man
because he wears such and such dress; or a

92
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,681
woman is appreciated because she has a particular
type of hairstyle.

93
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:52,501
If the hairstyle changes, the man can ask
for a divorce.

94
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,650
So superficial they are.

95
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,601
The fight is with the husband that you didn't
buy a particular coat which I liked, so there's

96
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,121
a divorce.

97
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:04,411
It's so superficial.

98
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:12,871
So the relationship between husband and wife
is established by Shri Ganesh and He gives

99
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:19,741
you the pure idea about how to enjoy your
married life.

100
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:24,771
Why people like Freud become so important?

101
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:35,541
They start replacing Christ and people become
enamored by that.

102
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:44,681
Because human beings, if they know that in
potential state they are all divine, they

103
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:53,260
all have to become divine and not to go down
to the level of animals, even worse than that.

104
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:02,491
If they realize it that their main object
of life is resurrection, that they have to

105
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:10,471
rise above all these so-called temptations
of life.

106
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:27,630
If they know this potential, then they have
to believe in it also, so that they do not

107
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,101
have these absurd ideas about life.

108
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:37,821
As a human being, Christ came.

109
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:41,751
He came as a human being, but He was not a
human being.

110
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:42,931
He was divine.

111
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,590
Absolutely He was nothing but Aumkara.

112
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,111
That's why He could walk on the water.

113
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:54,971
There was nothing materialistic in Him, you
can say, no matter in Him.

114
00:12:54,971 --> 00:13:01,840
If there was any matter, He could not have
walked on the water.

115
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,871
But if people start discarding all these facts,
about His birth, about His walking on the

116
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:17,710
water and all that, then what is left of Christ,
I can't understand.

117
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,951
Now this message of His resurrection is very
important, but what you find that, as you

118
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:27,421
get three days holidays, people are just doing
what one should not do.

119
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:36,311
They have gone to some places, maybe with
their wives, may not be with their wives,

120
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:45,690
with anybody, into some sort of a rubbish
and they enjoy things which cannot be enjoyed

121
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,000
by anybody who is a realized soul.

122
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,161
So we have to know ourself that now we have
got our realization.

123
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,190
We got it.

124
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,340
Not that it is in a potential state, but it
is in a kinetic state.

125
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:08,931
So, for us Christ should be a model, what
kind of life we should lead.

126
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:16,280
In those days of Christ, there were no aeroplanes,
there were no cars, nothing, but He went from

127
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,280
places to places and talked to them about
spiritual life.

128
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,630
The people were not yet evolved.

129
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,260
They were not matured enough.

130
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:37,141
So He could not give them realization, but
He talked about dharmic life.

131
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:51,431
He went to the extreme of the ten commandments
that He said not only that you should not

132
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:55,890
do adultery, but you should not even have
adulterous eyes.

133
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,101
Pure eyes.

134
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:02,131
Now how is it possible?

135
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:10,010
When you see Christians and Christian nations,
they suffer from this disease of not having

136
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,320
at all clean eyes.

137
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:21,121
There's a kind of a lust and greed in the
eye and they're not ashamed of it.

138
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:30,070
Thank God, Sahaja Yogis all over the world
have changed so much, transformed so much.

139
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:34,060
They've become so beautiful that this problem
we don't have.

140
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,991
And if somebody has it, we want that person
to get out of Sahaja yoga till they cure themselves

141
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:45,020
and come to normal.

142
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:52,400
The main problem of the Christian nation is
that they have become too much mental.

143
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,601
Even sex they do mentally, in the sense [that]
they flirt.

144
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:07,570
The eyes are so much all the time looking
at something and reacting to it.

145
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,921
They cannot witness anything.

146
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:19,150
Anything they'll see they start thinking about
it, react to it.

147
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:29,390
Then the reaction, because they are not evolved,
can take them to any level of bestiality - Worse

148
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,071
than beasts.

149
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:43,881
For example, an innocent person sees something,
he goes into thoughtless awareness and he

150
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:51,051
just enjoys the beauty of that; but a person
who is full of lust and greed can never enjoy

151
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,051
anything.

152
00:16:52,051 --> 00:17:01,871
On the contrary, he would like to possess
that thing or would go beyond limits of his

153
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:08,681
authority and enjoy somebody else's wife,
somebody else's husband.

154
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:16,041
It's a very subtle thing, which we should
understand when we make friendship with others.

155
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,741
What do we enjoy in the friendship?

156
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:23,821
What do we see in that friendship?

157
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:28,160
As realized soul, how your friendship should
be?

158
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,651
The friendship should be pure - nirvajya.

159
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:42,891
That is, you're friendly with somebody because
just you enjoy the pure friendship, where

160
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:54,971
there's no sense of possession or also the
sense of destruction.

161
00:17:54,971 --> 00:18:03,050
Such a friendship is a Sahaj friendship.

162
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:10,271
I have seen people all over the world, when
they come to Ganapatipule, the way they laugh,

163
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:20,221
the way they enjoy and I feel so happy there's
this new world of such innocent people has

164
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,371
been created on this Earth in My lifetime.

165
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:32,721
You should also realize that you belong now
to a very higher type of people, very higher

166
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:33,721
type.

167
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:45,741
There's no justification for any Sahaja Yogi
to indulge into such dirty stuff, because

168
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,011
he is beyond it.

169
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:54,160
He has developed a new sense of beauty and
cleanliness.

170
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:04,221
He cannot bear anything, which makes him look
like a person who goes towards all kinds of

171
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,400
filthy things.

172
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,391
This is a specialty, which you have got it,
which was potentially within you and despite

173
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:19,411
the atmosphere in which you lived and you
saw, you just got out of it and became like

174
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:24,481
beautiful lotuses in the pond of filth.

175
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:34,930
And these lotuses themselves can give such
beautiful fragrance to others that they can

176
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,241
make the whole pond fragrant and beautiful.

177
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:46,781
So the responsibility on you is much more
than, I would say, on Christ because Christ

178
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:47,911
was divine.

179
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:52,211
I was asking them to get Devi Mahatmyam, if
possible.

180
00:19:52,211 --> 00:20:02,321
In that He's described as the son of Lord
Krishna and Radhaji and that He has been given

181
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:08,770
a special power and is called as a Support
of the Universe.

182
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,491
Just imagine.

183
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:11,491
Mooladhar.

184
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:14,060
He is the Support of the Universe.

185
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:27,421
And the birth is described in a beautiful
way that first He was created like an egg.

186
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,821
This purity, this auspiciousness was made
into an egg.

187
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:35,951
That's why during Easter you people give eggs
to friends.

188
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:48,180
Now this egg was nicely also kept for ages
and then it was broken into two.

189
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:57,400
The first one became Shri Ganesha and the
second one, which evolved fully... like an

190
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:06,701
egg when it is evolved and is fully mature,
the second one was Christ.

191
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:14,531
You may say that, "How is it one egg has two
forms?"

192
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,321
I must say these are divine happenings.

193
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:24,921
They have very different from what we see
in the mundane world.

194
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:33,581
Now, this egg, the second part of it, became
a child and He was crying for His Father.

195
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:42,611
All His life, Christ talked for His Father
and when He knew He] will be crucified, He

196
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:54,491
prayed to His Father saying that "Oh Father,
save Me from this cup of crucifixion," He

197
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,491
prayed.

198
00:21:55,491 --> 00:22:03,331
And if you see His two fingers, these two
fingers are always out - expression of His

199
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,331
blessing.

200
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:10,290
This is the one, which stands, as you know
very well, for Shri Krishna, and this one

201
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,310
for Vishnu.

202
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,371
So always He showed these two fingers.

203
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:25,670
There are so many things by which we can,
as Sahaja Yogis, find out how Christ has been

204
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,991
ruling throughout.

205
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:30,751
He is not dead.

206
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:43,270
His body might have been perished in Kashmir,
as they say, but He was the spirit and the

207
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:57,821
spirit that was in Him was a living, eternally
living, great personality.

208
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:09,270
We may say that He might have had little bit
of, we can say, the human aspect to camouflage

209
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:18,430
Himself, after all spirit just cannot come
in, and that might have been dead, that part,

210
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,831
that camouflage that He was using.

211
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:40,211
In divinity, as Ganesha is pure, He is absolutely
beyond any kind of contamination.

212
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:45,780
Other incarnations who came on this Earth,
they had to do many things.

213
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:53,331
Like Shri Krishna had to go in the war of
Mahabharata.

214
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:58,391
Rama had to go in the jungle to deal with
people.

215
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:08,741
Same with Christ, we can say, that He did
go to all these places, but He never behaved

216
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:09,741
like a human being.

217
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,741
Others did.

218
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:17,961
Shri Rama cried a lot, wept a lot for His
wife.

219
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:29,361
Then Shri Krishna married so many times - because
they were His powers so He married them.

220
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:34,381
So, though they were incarnations, they had
to very much do the things which human beings

221
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:35,381
do.

222
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,831
Christ was never married.

223
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:44,290
He never wept, as far as we know, except when
He was praying to His Father.

224
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:53,831
He just asked that "If You could remove this
cup from My mouth I'll be very happy."

225
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:58,851
So it's shown in His character that He came
on this Earth as a divine personality, lived

226
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:05,410
as a divine personality and died as a divine
personality.

227
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:14,841
I think that way it is much easier to be because
you are a divine person, you come, give some

228
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:18,711
sermons, lectures, this, that and just go
away.

229
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:24,711
He didn't take the responsibility of giving
realization to people, which is the greatest

230
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:27,920
headache, I think, to give realizations to
people.

231
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:36,081
Because, if you give them the resurrection,
if they get their realization...

232
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:41,501
Christ accepted His resurrection as a natural
thing because He knew all about it, and that

233
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:42,731
He didn't have to change.

234
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,001
He didn't have to transform Himself.

235
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:50,351
He was the same as He was because He did not
need any resurrection.

236
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:57,831
He just tried to show in His life that we
human beings can have our realization and

237
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,861
we can be resurrected.

238
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:07,721
His message is not the cross but the resurrection
and this resurrection if you understand, then

239
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:16,461
one can understand also one more thing - that
we are now resurrected from ordinary human

240
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,420
beings to the divine level.

241
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,400
It was easier for Christ because He didn't
have to face any problems, while you are coming

242
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,071
out of that human life to a such a higher
life.

243
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:37,751
Suddenly, it is too much.

244
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:38,941
I agree.

245
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:43,251
It is too much to accept.

246
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:56,371
But because you go beyond your mind, it's
not difficult - because your mind stops thinking.

247
00:26:56,371 --> 00:27:02,761
Otherwise, normally people would have been
thinking, "Now, I am resurrected.

248
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:03,761
All right.

249
00:27:03,761 --> 00:27:06,050
So what should I do?

250
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,400
What should I drop out?

251
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,191
What things should go away?

252
00:27:10,191 --> 00:27:12,901
What is the goal?"

253
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:17,211
All these ideas of human beings would have
followed you slowly.

254
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:22,790
But no, you just felt, "We are there.

255
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,831
Now what to do?

256
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,111
We are there."

257
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:35,611
You became conscious of your qualities, of
your virtues, of your greatness and those

258
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:43,741
who were conscious became very confident that
we have these values already existing within

259
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:52,451
us; we have these powers, which are manifesting
and these powers are flowing through us.

260
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:53,790
Nobody doubted it.

261
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,160
Some did, but very few.

262
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,400
As you grew up, immediately you knew that
the Divine is acting through you.

263
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,001
Is there.

264
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,001
Everything is tangible.

265
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:07,901
You know everything about your inner being.

266
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:16,201
Gradually, you start spreading out your self,
spreading out your personality.

267
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:21,281
And then you don't have the weaknesses as
human beings have.

268
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:23,800
We had some funny people, no doubt.

269
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,310
I know that people start thinking about how
to make money out of Sahaja Yoga, - and that's

270
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:36,881
still a human nonsense going on - or how to
show your powers, how to show how your powers

271
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:48,091
can assert, how to sort of use your ego to
put down people.

272
00:28:48,091 --> 00:29:00,731
All these are human style of lives and it
existed for some time, but now I find you

273
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:06,550
all are washed as if through this kundalini
has just washed you completely.

274
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,882
You all have become very beautiful people,
extremely beautiful, and even people... they

275
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:13,701
see you at the airport and they think that
these are some unique people.

276
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:20,301
Even in this area when we came, they were
telling Me that... the gentleman who is the

277
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:29,091
caretaker was saying that he has never seen
such a group - "They don't fight; they don't

278
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:34,020
argue; they don't make money; the children
are so sweet.

279
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:43,170
It's remarkable, such a society in these modern
times never existed anywhere and how is it,

280
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,461
it is existing here?"

281
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:51,091
They were quite surprised as, also you should
be, that you have achieved this without any

282
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:57,351
much effort or any penance or going to Himalayas.

283
00:29:57,351 --> 00:30:01,131
You got it because it was all there.

284
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,810
It was all there and you found it.

285
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,821
Our marriages are, ninety percent are successful.

286
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:14,261
We have problems from the parents sometimes,
from the society, but it's too little to be

287
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:25,680
mentioned and it makes one sense to Me - that
we can really change this world.

288
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,451
No doubt about it.

289
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:35,101
If you remember that the message of Christ
is resurrection, that has already happened.

290
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,621
Now, after resurrection what?

291
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:41,550
Your attention should be there.

292
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,160
If it is still on your job, on your money,
on your car, your house, this, that, then

293
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,511
you are still a human being.

294
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:54,261
You have not yet lost that attachment.

295
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:59,060
Or on your children and your spouses and all.

296
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,721
That is all being still absolutely human.

297
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:10,221
But a person who is divine has all the relations
but doesn't get attached and involved into.

298
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:16,430
I've given many a time a very good] example
of the trees.

299
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:24,290
See in the tree the sap rises, goes to various
parts of the tree, either it is evaporated

300
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,390
or it goes back to Mother Earth.

301
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,280
It never gets attached to anything.

302
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:35,491
As long you are attached to your children,
attached to this, attached to that, then try

303
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:39,510
to understand that divinity has not fully
manifested.

304
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:45,380
That detachment is not neglect, never.

305
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:59,890
On the contrary, it is the most pure detachment,
which really nourishes every area of your

306
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,890
life.

307
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,571
Wherever you go, it nourishes.

308
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:06,920
So you have to test yourself.

309
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,760
Nobody else has to do it.

310
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,050
"How far I have been kind to others?

311
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,670
How far I have been helpful to others?

312
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,971
How far I have been collective?"

313
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:25,060
I have seen glimpses of this many a times
and it has given Me great joy.

314
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:34,001
Like, once we had a program of Sahaja yogis
and the gentleman had invited Me alone for

315
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,001
dinner.

316
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:42,441
So the program was there and I just thought
that how can all these people eat in his house,

317
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:43,731
you see?

318
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:49,920
So I waited till they disappeared, all the
Sahaja Yogis disappeared.

319
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,961
This gentleman came to say, "Mother why did
you ask them to go?

320
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:53,800
I had cooked for all of them."

321
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,541
See this made Me so happy.

322
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,041
He had a small house.

323
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,101
I don't know how he cooked for all of them.

324
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:05,721
And so much food he had cooked already and
he was waiting - all of them to have some

325
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:11,921
food, and I just thought that it is too much
for him to feed so many people.

326
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:20,921
In the same way, we have to have this feeling
that we are all collective and we have to

327
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:21,921
help each other.

328
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:26,800
It is, say in the body, if I have any problem
in any finger, any hand, anywhere, the whole

329
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:36,201
body runs for it, the whole body suffers for
it, whole body knows about it.

330
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:43,381
In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga there should
be a common feeling all over the world.

331
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:52,010
If something happens here, one person is affected,
the whole world should know.

332
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,650
Not only that know, but they should make efforts.

333
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:01,781
If one person is suffering, the whole world
will suffer for that and this is what is the

334
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,271
culmination of our collectivity.

335
00:34:03,271 --> 00:34:11,291
Those who try to keep out of it, you see,
in the collectivity, cannot grow also.

336
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:19,451
About many things I have to say, but specially
I would say that when we see somebody in difficulties,

337
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:25,571
say financial difficulty, at that time we
should try to suggest or try to help that

338
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:29,971
person as just a part and parcel of the whole.

339
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:34,761
Then that person will realize that I have
so many people here.

340
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,301
I am not alone.

341
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:42,121
Somebody might get more, somebody might get
less, makes no difference.

342
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:49,531
But the activity of the collective should
be such that you should feel that oneness,

343
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:56,211
that innate feeling for another person, innate.

344
00:34:56,211 --> 00:35:04,511
You not have to think about it, but is innately
you should feel attached to that person and

345
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:07,971
you should feel that you have to do something
about it.

346
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:14,391
"After all, why should he not have the same
joy as I have?"

347
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:20,571
So the first thing that you will do, of such
people, is normally... is to help him in his

348
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,721
chakras, help him in his endeavors.

349
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:29,011
It is very easy now to do Sahaja Yoga.

350
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:34,001
In the olden times, it was very difficult.

351
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:37,701
If you had tried Sahaja Yoga say, in the early
time of Christ, you all might have been crucified.

352
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:38,911
Could be.

353
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,711
What did Christ do after all?

354
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:41,711
Why was He crucified?

355
00:35:41,711 --> 00:35:43,671
But nowadays that's not so.

356
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:46,211
Then you...

357
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:54,341
like other saints, any people in India, "Thousands
of years," they said, "we have been meditating.

358
00:35:54,341 --> 00:36:04,911
We started our meditation when we were nothing
and now years after years, our different births

359
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:11,931
after births, we have worked hard to get to
this situation, that now we have got realization."

360
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,811
You don't have that problem.

361
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:17,361
There's no problem at all.

362
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:26,391
Except for one, that you have to have full
assessment of yourself, that you are the pure

363
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:30,571
Spirit and that you are in the kingdom of
God.

364
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,281
Just like Christ - it did not matter to Him.

365
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:37,901
He had to oppose something that was wrong,
He did it.

366
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:42,451
When He had to support something was destroyed
and saved, He did it.

367
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:49,001
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalene,
but when people started stoning her, He went

368
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:55,861
and stood before her and He said, "Those who
have not committed any sin, can throw stone

369
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,861
at her."

370
00:36:56,861 --> 00:37:03,232
See this courage, this confidence was in Him
because He was a divine personality, because

371
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:04,261
of divinity.

372
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:06,171
But you have become divine.

373
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:13,511
In a way, you know better about life than
He knew because He never touched all these

374
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:17,571
points that you have touched from what problems
you have come out.

375
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:22,961
So, you should have much more understanding
for people who are not in Sahaja Yoga or who

376
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:23,961
want to come to Sahaj Yoga.

377
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:28,911
Like, as soon as they come to any program,
you should not start saying, "You are a bhoot,

378
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,471
you are that."

379
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:34,121
You were a bhoot before you came here.

380
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:40,631
Quite a big bhoot, if you ask Me, I can tell
you.

381
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:51,871
But when you realize what is your importance
- now you have become qualified.

382
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:54,941
You know everything about it.

383
00:37:54,941 --> 00:38:02,621
When you know that this has happened, then
try just to follow few rules about Sahaja

384
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:03,621
Yoga.

385
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:07,871
It's very easy for you to follow because you
are divine.

386
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:08,871
No problem.

387
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,871
No problem.

388
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:16,421
You can follow it very well, but don't yield
to human pressures that still linger in you

389
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,691
or may be in the society.

390
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:25,781
You keep to your own style, to your own behavior
and you'll be amazed that the rest of the

391
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:29,781
world will worship you - not hang you, but
worship you.

392
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:32,141
In your lifetime, it's going to happen.

393
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:40,961
But try to understand that you are being resurrected
for a purpose, and that purpose is to transform

394
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:46,121
this world into a beautiful place for which
all of you should, with full attention, with

395
00:38:46,121 --> 00:38:50,841
full understanding about yourself, about your
responsibilities, should jump into it.

396
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:54,641
Australia has a special responsibility.

397
00:38:54,641 --> 00:39:04,181
As I told you, some are so over-responsible
and some are not at all.

398
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:12,461
I can't understand why it is so, why it (is)
happening like that.

399
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:19,711
I see people who are so attentive and some
whose attention is still not all right - moving

400
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:22,571
like this, moving like that.

401
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:27,581
So, you should try to follow people who have
reached a certain height.

402
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:33,581
Try to follow their life, their lifestyle
and then you will be amazed that you can do

403
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,251
it very easily because you are mature.

404
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:41,601
It's like, I have said that we are like an
egg and it has to be hatched once you are

405
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,271
mature, but some chicks come out and just
start walking nicely, with little, little

406
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:48,831
legs you see them very nicely walking towards
the mother.

407
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:59,381
And the others are still there covered with
all kinds of filth on them and not able to

408
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:06,161
walk and then these ones who can walk just
bring them, you see, they poke them with their

409
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:11,121
beaks and say, "Come along, come along, come
along" and they bring it to the mother.

410
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,121
It's very interesting.

411
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,121
You must watch them.

412
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:21,601
This Easter has a great meaning that we are
now newly born chicks and we have to now follow

413
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,531
a new path.

414
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:28,221
It's a very simple path, but still we are
conditioned so we are afraid, maybe, or we

415
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:30,071
have an ego, whatever it is.

416
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,911
So drop out all these things.

417
00:40:31,911 --> 00:40:38,781
Just humble down and just start walking on
this path of Sahaj and one day Australia should

418
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,201
be able to cover the whole world.

419
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,351
I can't see why not?

420
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:54,401
After all you are the mooladhara and the mooladhara
must play its own role as the wisest people.

421
00:40:54,401 --> 00:41:00,771
Wisdom is the power that you get from Shri
Ganesh.

422
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:09,351
So you have to be wise, absolutely wise and
know that you have been seekers.

423
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:12,231
You didn't get it because I asked you or we
paid you or anything, but you were seekers

424
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:20,211
struggling to know the truth and that's how
you got it and once you have got it, you should

425
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:25,116
establish it fully in your life and also in
the lives of others.

426
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:29,758
Let others also feel this gentleman is very
unique or this lady is very unique.

427
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:36,467
She's very different, she's not selfish, she's
not cunning, she doesn't manipulate, but somehow

428
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:45,343
by her character, by her nature she is trying
to create light for us and enlighten our path,

429
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,739
enlighten the path of others.

430
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,993
May God bless you all.
