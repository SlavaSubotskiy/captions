1
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:05,356
Now I think I have covered most of the points.

2
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:09,068
But if you have any question, you can ask them today.

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:18,364
Q.; “Shri Mother, we feel the same chakras,
more on legs than on the fingers.”

4
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,836
The integration is not there, that’s why.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,952
You have to attend collectively.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,766
You have to be more collective. The body has to be collective.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,106
The thing is that if you are not a collective person

8
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,261
then sometimes you’ll feel them on the legs,

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,522
sometimes on the hand, sometimes in the head.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,274
That’s not a good thing. 
You should try to be more collective, you should

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,795
meet more people, take more interest.

12
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:45,156
You see, the body of your’s

13
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,409
want work out efficiently unless and until you use it.

14
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:59,586
Because individually you see if they individually if you work out,

15
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:06,309
it will not develop collectively, because where are you using it?

16
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:10,317
You are correcting your self to give it to others.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,309
And if you don’t give it, if you do not work it out

18
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:17,218
in a collective way, there is no circulation.

19
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,615
For example, there’s a fruit is there,

20
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:28,329
and you take it out of the tree, and you mature it.

21
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:33,122
But if it is connected with the tree,

22
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:43,210
it will mature by itself giving a proper identity to itself

23
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:49,086
and to the tree, and taste would be better.

24
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:53,411
And those who would come under that tree

25
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:56,983
will receive the fruits of that tree.

26
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:01,983
But a fruit, which is separated, will be lost after sometime.

27
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:07,138
 That is how one has to be very collective.

28
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:13,269
Q. How to develop our discrimination, Mother?

29
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,813
Discrimination comes through Hamsa Chakra.

30
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:27,460
And Hamsa chakra is very simple thing,
is to put some ghee in the nose,

31
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,992
is a physical thing.

32
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,409
On the emotional side, one should not cry too much.

33
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,733
Or women specially have too much crying business.

34
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:45,936
I also sometimes feel like crying, but seldom.

35
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,856
So sometimes men must cry also.

36
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:57,721
Now spiritually, to develop discrimination

37
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:03,237
is by vibratory awareness.

38
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,531
When your vibrations are developed,

39
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:12,404
then you automatically discriminate.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,848
You are such a big computer.

41
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:19,459
It has to work in its full way, and

42
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,724
then you’ll be amazed what a computer you are.

43
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,599
I’ll give you an example of Warren now.

44
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:33,335
Pat’s husband Prole, who was

45
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,672
measuring my house for certain purpose,

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,640
while Warren was sleeping. Poor David was working,
Warren was sleeping.

47
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,909
And in his dream, he dreamt that he had finished 
with the last measurement.

48
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,103
And in his half-sleep he got up

49
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:53,627
and he told him that this house measures...how much?

50
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:01,655
Three thousand nine hundred and sixteen square feet.

51
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:05,119
And ‘exactly’ that’s what David Prole had written!

52
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:09,563
Poor David had worked so hard measuring everything!

53
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:14,229
He actually fell from his chair! 
You see.

54
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:24,027
Like today I told Guido that I think 
I spent three hundred and eighty pounds.

55
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:29,297
And he said, no it was three hundred.
I never calculated, nothing. I just said it.

56
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,142
And by calculation, it was 379, according to him,
but I gave him one pound more!

57
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:42,863
So it was 380. And that’s how you become a computer.

58
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:47,665
All mathematics comes through your brain. It’s so dynamic.

59
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,633
But first of all you have to have concentration,
concentration of your devotion.

60
00:04:56,684 --> 00:05:06,015
Such a person achieves that.
There are so many blessing waiting for you, to be manifested.

61
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:18,522
Just you have to concentrate
your efforts in devotion and dedication.

62
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,081
May God Bless You.
