1
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,730
Today 

2
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,780
is 

3
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,859
the day we 

4
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:19,649
are celebrating Easter. Easter is extremely
symbolic, of - not only of Christ, but also

5
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:20,610
for all of us. In that the most important
day is that of resurrection. The resurrection

6
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:39,950
of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.
Through resurrection Christ had shown that

7
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:03,450
one can be resurrected with the body that
you have. And without His resurrection, we

8
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:18,740
could not have managed the crossing of Agnya
chakra, no doubt. His life was very short

9
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,580
of, we can say three and half years only,
He lived there. He came to India and He met

10
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:48,179
Shalivahana, and Shalivahana asked His name.
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

11
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,440
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

12
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there. To Me,

13
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,769
this is My country."

14
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:17,769
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

15
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,799
Nirmala Tattwam. So He went back, and as it
is, within three and half years He was crucified.

16
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

17
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:51,600
said "Behold the Mother." That means you should
hope for the Mother. And in His lifetime He

18
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:01,990
also said that, "I'll send you the Holy Ghost
Who will comfort you, counsel you and also

19
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,700
redeem", means resurrect you. All these things
He had said it because He knew what was the

20
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,889
whole plan.

21
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:27,889
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

22
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:36,820
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.
I will not tolerate at any cost."

23
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,010
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost. No doubt

24
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,350
about it. It's not Me that is dangerous, but
these Deities are extremely dangerous.

25
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:08,309
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body. Before this you were not connected

26
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,620
to the All Pervading Power, and whatever you
did was through your mind or through your

27
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:31,590
emotions. But you did not come out of that
grave of emotions and your desires, your actions

28
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:51,169
and your ego. After realization now you know
how free you have become. How you have developed

29
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,320
your own personality.

30
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:15,169
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

31
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,080
throughout. He knew without knowing yourself,
you won't be resurrected. But Sahaja Yoga

32
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,080
is the other way round. You get your resurrection
and you know yourself. It's a very Sahaja,

33
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:44,399
sweet way of getting realization.

34
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:51,399
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls. We too have

35
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,960
in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open to everyone,
all kinds of people come. We find very shallow

36
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,960
people coming to Sahaja Yoga who try to express
their shallowness and talk in a very, in a

37
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:23,630
very loose way, about Sahaja Yoga, about the
work of Sahaja Yoga. So that was inevitable,

38
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:35,120
but what Christ has said that you have to
be careful about the murmuring souls. And

39
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:44,139
this is exactly - we have to be very careful.
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning,

40
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:52,519
you may come across such people who are murmuring
souls, you may be enticed by them because

41
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:01,950
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers
of negative forces. And these messengers of

42
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:12,139
negative forces, you should try to find out.
They'll complain about this, complain about

43
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:19,139
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and
when you see that they are not talking in

44
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:31,850
a positive way, you should run away from them.
Because only by getting your resurrection

45
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,490
you are not all right. After getting your
resurrection, after your Self-realization,

46
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:48,059
you have to grow. And for that growth we have
to be very careful about how we get impressed

47
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:56,419
by all these, I should say, very frivolous
people. Those who grow into it become beautiful

48
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:09,070
angels. No doubt about that. But that is one
thing one has to know is to respect your Self-realization.

49
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:16,340
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

50
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:23,340
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

51
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,100
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

52
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:36,610
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.
But now you should leave your mind on one

53
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:43,610
side; because this mind, if you go on working
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja

54
00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:50,629
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your
mind. Then you know yourself, because you

55
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,990
get Self-knowledge. You know about your centers.
You know about the centers of others. All

56
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
this is available to you, but you have to
become a subtler and subtler person. Not a

57
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:16,129
gross personality. If you become subtler and
subtler, you will be amazed how you will develop

58
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,509
your inner powers in so many different ways.

59
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:30,929
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious. And they start

60
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:37,929
saying that, "Mother, we want to be God realized.
I want to be this and do that." There is no

61
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:48,250
office going on here that you give somebody
a promotion. You have to grow yourself. Then

62
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:55,830
they start proclaiming, "I am this, I am that."
We call them 'Mahayogis'. Some of them had

63
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,990
started saying that they have reached very
high positions and they ended up in the lunatic

64
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:11,049
asylum. All such suggestions if people give
you, then you should shun such people. But

65
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,730
there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow. So, you must remember

66
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:29,370
that this last judgment is working and all
the time there is a big sieving out, a very

67
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:40,450
big arrangement of choices. Those who are
subtle, start getting subtler and subtler

68
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:52,860
and subtler. But those who are frivolous,
gross, idiotic, stupid, they start frittering

69
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:01,559
away. So this last sieving starts very fast,
working out where we realize that where are

70
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:06,929
we.

71
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:13,929
Now what is the criteria for that? First is
your compassion. Your compassion must be discrete.

72
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,509
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people. After Sahaja Yoga you should

73
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:39,509
know for whom you should have your compassion.
With vibrations you can find out, very easy

74
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:50,710
to find out with vibrations - what sort of
a person you are facing. But first you must

75
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,039
have vibratory awareness. If you don't have
vibratory awareness, you won't be able to

76
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:04,039
find out at all what is correct and what is
incorrect. So it is important that you all

77
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:18,740
must mediate. Without criticizing yourself,
anything, you can just meditate everyday.

78
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,840
Is very important!
I immediately know who is the person who is

79
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,840
meditating and who is not meditating. Immediately!
The person who meditates is very clearly an

80
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:45,509
angel. The whole reaction, the whole behavior,
the whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

81
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:58,629
manifests. And you are amazed. As you know
Sahasrare Mahamaya. It's not easy to understand

82
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:10,990
Me. For the time being you might know what
I am, but suddenly you will forget. That's

83
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:17,990
the trick. Because if you know Me in full
ways, you won't even sit here. You won't even

84
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:29,249
come nearer to Me. So that Mahamaya is acting
all the time, but that's the only way you

85
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,249
can judge people.

86
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:40,129
This last judgment is not a easy thing. Even
if you put thousands of judges, they cannot

87
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:47,129
do this judgment. All the time you have to
know what is what. And somehow I know everything,

88
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,559
but I will never show that I know. That's
how I work it out, and gradually I know what

89
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,820
I have to do about that person.

90
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:14,820
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ. He was alone; people

91
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,960
wouldn't recognize Him. He had to show His
marks where they had put nails on His hands

92
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,360
and feet. But today that is not the situation.
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize

93
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Me. That's all. Need not know Me. It's not
easy. It's difficult to know Me, but if you

94
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:50,530
recognize Me, that's all. And it all depends
on your sensitivity. Your resurrection has

95
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:59,919
to be complete and you have to mature in Sahaja
Yoga. If you cannot mature, I will say you

96
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,230
should leave Sahaja Yoga. Go out for a while,
where you will understand what's going on,

97
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,940
then you'll come back.

98
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:21,940
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

99
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:33,470
your life. Your Mother doesn't want that.
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you

100
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:42,390
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule
sometimes, or somewhere. You have to face

101
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:51,510
many odds while traveling, also coming down
here may not be so comfortable as you are

102
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:02,180
at your place. But the main sacrifice is of
your ego. You have to crucify your ego. The

103
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,450
ego is the one, which teaches you all these
nonsensical tantrums that people know. If

104
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:23,050
you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

105
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:34,450
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

106
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

107
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:51,130
ego. So the best way is to meditate, to go
into thoughtless awareness and there automatically

108
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,790
you are surrendered.

109
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,240
Now what do I have to have from you? Nothing!
I don't want anything. I don't want to have

110
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,770
anything. You are the ones who try to give
Me this and give Me that. I am trying to run

111
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:14,770
away from all that. Just for your satisfaction
also, I agree. I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga

112
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Myself, but that's the love of your Mother.
That She wants to save as many as possible

113
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:34,579
- all that are created on this Earth - to
give them their resurrection. This is a special

114
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:43,240
time and you are My channels. You can go all
over and spread Sahaja Yoga and try to help

115
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,819
others to come out of it.

116
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:54,819
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

117
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:02,990
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga. This growth

118
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,240
has to take place for which I have to meditate.
This is a very important thing.

119
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:25,329
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly. They are not willing to do this.

120
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:34,200
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that. I think generosity

121
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,010
is one expression of your love. You will give
Me, all right. When it comes to expenses,

122
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:48,010
either I pay or somebody bears the burden.
Now things have improved, but still we should

123
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:56,470
know that this tremendous work has to be done
and we need money for that. I don't need,

124
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:04,690
I spend My own money. But generosity is the
best and this generosity is very, very important

125
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,140
for Sahaja Yogis.

126
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:18,140
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating. They will tell Me, "Bring

127
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:24,200
some sarees for them." Take some sarees, all
right, very good idea. And they say, "We don't

128
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:31,059
like it, we don't want to buy." I am not doing
any business. I buy it because you wanted,

129
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:37,410
I have selected it. Then to say, "we don't
want to have it." There's no business, there's

130
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:44,410
no marketing going on. And this is the problem
when I don't understand Sahaja Yogis that

131
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,900
they should know Mother, Herself, has put
in Her money. So what is there also, they

132
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:57,900
should say, "take little more for Sahaja Yoga."
After all such a big organization going on,

133
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,260
and there are so many countries who cannot
pay a single farthing, for them also one has

134
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,450
to pay.

135
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:14,450
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles. You
can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

136
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:23,670
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

137
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,839
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you. You cannot

138
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,119
sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja Yoga.
But that doesn't mean you exploit it. So I

139
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,890
have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

140
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:58,890
are extremely generous, extremely generous.
And then generosity helps you, in a way that

141
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:08,690
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

142
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:15,260
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

143
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:22,260
to pay for anything like this. It's very remarkable
that some people take over, but everybody

144
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:34,530
must contribute. It's important, because you
are doing God's work. You have to also come

145
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:41,450
forward to do other things that are there
without grudging. Enjoying it! I was happy

146
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:48,410
the posters were put by the Sahaja Yogis,
and you can see the whole place vibrated.

147
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:55,410
You could see how it has worked out. So everybody
must go all out to do everything that is possible.

148
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:07,030
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga. Then you will see how you

149
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:15,319
will grow. It is only through your heart you
will receive all your nourishment for your

150
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:22,319
spirituality. So open 

151
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:38,490
your heart, do 
not calculate so much.
