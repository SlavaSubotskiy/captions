1
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:10,666
It’s so nice to come back after such a long time.

2
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:17,401
And whenever I came, you always had gathered in a very big hall.

3
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:22,906
We met, and that’s how the Sahaja Yoga started growing.

4
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:34,670
It’s very important for you people from specially from Germany, Austria.

5
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:40,498
These are the people who were in the war.

6
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:44,306
And now you are in the war with Me.

7
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:48,798
We have to fight, fight the evil.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,280
You know how the world is.

9
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:58,714
We have to fight them and we have to take them out of ignorance.

10
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:10,426
You are such a support for this because we have to change human beings.

11
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:16,107
They have to become good people very fast.

12
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:21,159
Once they get their Self-realization, the change will start.

13
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:25,514
Now in England and also in Italy,

14
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:31,002
 what they are doing is to give realization to people on the street.

15
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:36,396
Giving on the street, thousands of people now have become realized souls.

16
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:42,930
It’s a very big thing because once you get your realization, 
you become the Spirit

17
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,533
and all the goodness should come to you.

18
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:50,791
If there is anything evil, bad in you that will go away.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,330
It’s spreading so fast everywhere 
and should also spread in those countries who are there.

20
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:04,093
There’s no need, no need for you to fight or quarrel

21
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:07,854
because you have got the divine help.

22
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:15,002
You have got all the help all the time from the Divine,

23
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:18,959
and this is what is to be understood:

24
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:26,653
 that we are helped by the Divine to transform 
human beings into something greater.

25
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:30,860
That’s what we are and we are here

26
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:36,924
because I wanted to tell people that you must have a place, an ashram

27
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:43,953
 for Sahaja Yoga, and I don’t want anybody else, but only sahaja yogis there

28
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:48,051
 because you don’t know how dirty people are in this world.

29
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:54,232
What things they do, you can’t imagine to what limit they can go and

30
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,648
can really try to harm you

31
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:02,946
because they are not only negative, but they are sometimes satanic

32
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:05,705
and they’ll try to ruin your children,

33
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,788
 ruin your families, do all kinds of things.

34
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:11,748
So you have nothing to do with them. Keep away.

35
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:16,142
Keep aloof because now you all have been cleansed.

36
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:21,968
Those who are cleansed people don’t mix up 
with people who are muddy, do they?

37
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:27,109
And so must have this much of wisdom in your head to understand

38
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:32,187
that at any cost you will not mix up Sahaja Yoga with other things.

39
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,934
It’s very important to know.

40
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:41,773
I have been trying to tell this since long that keep yourself aloof.

41
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,413
But sometimes people don’t do it and then they suffer a lot.

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:55,350
We have all kinds of devils around, all kinds of satanic forces acting as some sort of a

43
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,919
cult, or I don’t know what they are doing,

44
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,355
 but they’ve done no good to people, no good at all.

45
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:07,863
Just see what is going on in those days: is all kinds of fighting, quarrelling, killing.

46
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:15,688
All this is going on, so you must know we are in the very, very bad type of Kali Yuga

47
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,883
and we have to fight it out by collectivity.

48
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,418
Look at the children, how collective they are.

49
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:26,655
You all have to be collective and you must love

50
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,475
all the people, all the sahaja yogis who are around.

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,679
Don’t try to find faults with them.

52
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:41,367
Don’t try to fight with them because it’s a very important work I am doing.

53
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,389
What I’m trying to do is to transform people,

54
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:49,719
to make them good people, nice people.

55
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:56,663
It’s not to get anything out of them, but to give them something

56
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:00,160
 that they should becomevery good people.

57
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,315
We have to have extremely good and nice people,

58
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:10,471
people who don’t hate, people who don’t have greed.

59
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,863
Like madness, people have greed.

60
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:19,133
In countries where they could make money, they have cheated everyone

61
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,521
 and have made money,and that is how their children will suffer.

62
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:26,124
They will suffer.

63
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:30,633
So My attention is for all of you

64
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:35,196
 because you can help Me in this great war,

65
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:40,313
 war with the evil.

66
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:43,754
These are evil people by temperament

67
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:47,153
and they want to ruin it. You must understand this.

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,794
Don’t play into their hands and you become solid 
because you have not come on this Earth to collect

69
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:56,942
things and all that, but you have come here

70
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,788
to become sahaja yogis of a very great order.

71
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:09,605
Another thing is, if you don’t feel your joy within yourself,

72
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:13,623
 if there is no joy with you, you will trouble others.

73
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,816
So best thing is for you is to meditate,

74
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:21,086
 not to criticize, not to use your brain, but meditate.

75
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,933
By meditation, you will know how to enjoy Sahaja Yoga,

76
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:32,203
how to enjoy everything. 
This has to be there and this mental activity should go away.

77
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:35,174
Don’t try to organize others.

78
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:40,472
Don’t try to give lectures to others, but what you do

79
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:44,551
 is to yourself introspect. See for yourself

80
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:49,107
what’s wrong with you and what's wrong things you are doing.

81
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:26,923
So not only being peaceful is everything, no.

82
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,725
Not only being good is equal, all right, but

83
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:37,579
 you have to make others, you have to make others good people.

84
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,662
You have to make them beautiful people.

85
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:47,301
We have to make this world beautiful through your own help and through your attention.

86
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:54,553
Now the problem is that people take to wrong things very easily even after Sahaj Yoga.

87
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:56,640
Don’t support anyone like that.

88
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:03,031
On the contrary, explain to that person that Sahaja Yoga is a collective activity.

89
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,030
We cannot have our own anything.

90
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,298
We have to be active.

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,669
We have to be together all the time.

92
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,420
Togetherness is very important and then to seek joy of that togetherness.

93
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:24,733
If you can feel that joy of togetherness,

94
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:29,233
you have achieved that aim of life

95
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:37,214
  becausethen you’ll gather other people also and give them this joy of being the Spirit.

96
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,679
Once they become the Spirit, it starts changing.

97
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,459
But if you are collective and if you are together

98
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:49,850
and you do all the things, then also you grow very much.

99
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,889
Now, those who talk of separating,

100
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:59,696
having some sort of a mad ideas – please don’t listen to them.

101
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:02,941
You better check.
Tell them, “We have to be together."

102
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:06,060
We cannot, we cannot separate.

103
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:08,647
And anything like this will be destroyed.

104
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,314
Because in this world, you see,

105
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:16,824
how the world is, how the things are and how it is working out.

106
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:24,079
So for you to understand the beauty of modern times, is that

107
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:29,258
you are born in a time when you can be transformed.

108
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:36,225
You are born in a time when you can become the Self, the Spirit.

109
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,256
Everybody has tried this; nothing has worked out.

110
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:44,973
Now, with the help of your Kundalini, we are working it out.

111
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,660
You also know what is to be done.

112
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,823
You know how to give realization,

113
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,259
 how to see the vibrations, everything.

114
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,549
And once you start seeing that, then you will realize

115
00:09:57,668 --> 00:10:02,088
that what you are doing is a great harm to humanity.

116
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,148
Now I leave upon you, all of you – you are such sensible,

117
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,351
good people who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

118
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:11,401
and every time I came here, you were all here.

119
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:16,929
I’m happy so many countries are here only just knowing that I am coming.

120
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,335
How much you all love Me, I tell you.

121
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,097
Really, it’s remarkable.

122
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,730
All you people have shown your love.

123
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:29,012
All of you have come here all the way, when I am here for such a short time.

124
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:32,998
So may God bless you all and have sense.

125
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:38,954
Have sense in your head that you are now responsible [UNCLEAR]

126
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:46,077
 transforming  this world into a new world of very good people, spiritual people.

127
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:53,858
So your responsibility is that, and as a result, what you have to do, you will know.

128
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:56,921
You all have to be very responsible.

129
00:10:57,215 --> 00:11:01,430
Whatever country you may come, whatever place you may come,

130
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:06,528
 but you have to be very, very responsible, responsible people,

131
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:10,843
and try to understand what you are doing for Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,006
I can see so many new faces now.

133
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:16,715
I’m happy to see them.

134
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:22,848
Of course most of the Austrians I have met and Germans I’ve met before, but I see also

135
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:27,550
other people from other countries –

136
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,177
very sweet of them to have come.

137
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:37,329
So what is important is to surrender, which is a problem with people.

138
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:41,952
They cannot surrender themselves to Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,393
That’s what is your life.

140
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:50,227
That is the beautiful river of goodness.

141
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,681
So you should try to surrender and

142
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:57,040
 if you cannot surrender, then there’s somethingwrong with you.

143
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,698
Please try to surrender and you’ll be surprised

144
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,524
that with this surrendering only

145
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:08,843
 you can get complete joy, happiness and peace.

146
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,983
That is very important and that’s what I have come to tell you that please try to surrender.

147
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:22,108
And surrendering is – I cannot say how you force yourself,

148
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:26,416
 but you just go into thoughtlessawareness.

149
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:33,277
You meditate and into thoughtless awareness and then I’m sure, with all My love

150
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:37,736
 and with all My blessings, I’m sure you will surrender

151
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:42,712
– not only surrender, but you will develop tremendous powers

152
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:48,492
 to convert others also, to transform others into thisgood work.

153
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:53,105
You all have that and if you just develop and try to find out

154
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:57,875
 how many people you have helped really in life to change.

155
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,750
Thank you very much.
