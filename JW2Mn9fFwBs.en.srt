00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,880


204
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,080


205
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600


206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000


207
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,040


208
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,200


209
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,800


210
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,640


211
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,640


212
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,800


213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800


214
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600


215
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,600


216
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000


217
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,640


218
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,920


219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,720


220
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,760


221
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,120


222
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,480


223
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,160


224
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,040


225
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720


226
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,920


227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040


228
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,680


229
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,840


230
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280


231
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,080


232
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,720


233
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,680


234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,960


235
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,560


236
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,360


237
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,840


238
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,360


239
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,120


240
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,080


241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,720


242
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240


243
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,760


244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,160


245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,920


246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,520


247
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720


248
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,120


249
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,480


250
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360


251
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,720


252
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,560


253
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,720
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

254
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,120
As doctor Reeves has told you,

255
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
you have to

256
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,880
become something.

257
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,560
What do we have to become?

258
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,480
We are born as human beings,

259
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
and we take it for granted that we are human beings.

260
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,720
[Shri Mataji smiles] We have to ask a question to ourselves :

261
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,720
why are we human beings?

262
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,520
What is the purpose of our life.

263
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,920
Is it that the whole evolution is purposeless,

264
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,080
that there is no Divine play in it?

265
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
And why it was done with such care,

266
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,000
and why we have become human beings?

267
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,320
So first, we have to come to right conclusions –

268
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,280
that is the counseling you can call it –

269
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,880
we have come, we have to understand,

270
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,840
that we have not become what we are supposed to be.

271
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,720
That’s why we are in confusion.

272
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,000
We do not have answers for these

273
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,760
fundamental questions.

274
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,080
Some believe in God, some don’t believe in God.

275
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,720
Some believe in Christ, some believe in Mohammed.

276
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,760
Some believe in Krishna,

277
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,400
some say that it’s all science.

278
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,320
We are so confused,

279
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,720
and there is no answer to it.

280
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,320
The reason is we are not that what we have to be.

281
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,760
Supposing an instrument is given to you,

282
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,480
and you don’t know anything about that.

283
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,200
Then you don’t know what is the purpose of that instrument,

284
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,880
and for which it was created,

285
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
and to what use it has to be put.

286
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,480
Thus, there’s a confusion,

287
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,040
and the confusion is to such an extent,

288
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,880
that in that confusion we have formed firm ideas,

289
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,920
mental projections,

290
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
artificial,

291
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,280
without any biological basis for it.

292
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,440
There is no biological basis for our

293
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,560
mental projections.

294
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
Just sit down here, and think now,

295
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,880
that see, this kind of a government if you make,

296
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,240
then people will be all right.

297
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,080
This is your own mental projection.

298
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,520
It has nothing living behind it;

299
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,920
it’s all dead thought.

300
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,280
By changing the governments,

301
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,680
have you been able to transform the people?

302
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,760
I have been to Russia, I have been to China,

303
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,360
I have been to America, to all these places.

304
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Human beings are just the same

305
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,600
there is no difference whatsoever.

306
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,800
Maybe some are more honest, some are more dishonest,

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,800
some are more immoral, some are less immoral,

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,200
but, on the balance, if you see you find any kind of person everywhere.

309
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
So one has to understand

310
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
that this kind of mental projection that we were having

311
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,960
about other things like social work,

312
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,080
people think that being social work and all that,

313
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,240
our ego can be conquered.

314
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,560
The greatest egoistical people are the social workers.

315
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,040
Now these mental projections have created also lots of norms for us.

316
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Like, I sit down here and decide I’ll give a title to someone.

317
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Now he becomes a titleholder.

318
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,440
Then he’s off, finished,

319
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
once for all he’s dead now to anything that is reality

320
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,560
because he’s living with something so unreal,

321
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,480
which was given to him by somebody which is so unreal.

322
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,320
There’s nothing living force behind it.

323
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,800
Have you seen any man changing by getting some sort of a

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,120
title or lot of money?

325
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
On the contrary he becomes worse,

326
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,920
never improves.

327
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
So what is the reason?

328
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,800
Why is it that when we go into an enterprise of this kind,

329
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,520
why is it, we find, that everything fails?

330
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,920
You talk of democracy, it becomes demonocracy.

331
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,360
You talk of communism, you find it is another headache.

332
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,360
You talk of anything, it all becomes such a funny thing,

333
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,920
and it recoils back on you.

334
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,280
Whatever you try, any enterprise, it recoils back.

335
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,120
Science, what is science now has become nothing but atomic war.

336
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,200
How is it, science coming [running?] to atomic war, no one knows,

337
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,320
but suddenly it has become a great threat to the whole world.

338
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Computers, tomorrow computers will start dominating us.

339
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,560
We see those things clearly happening to us,

340
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,880
and we are worried, we are shocked.

341
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,200
But we don’t know why is it, whatever we try to do, why,

342
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
it recoils on us, and entangles us,

343
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,040
and enslaves us.

344
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,920
The reason is it’s, it has no living force behind it.

345
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,440
It’s only mental, at mental level,

346
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,920
and human beings live only on mental level.

347
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,960
So there has to be another higher level

348
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,760
which is generated when you get in contact with a living force.

349
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,240
Now let us see what is the living force.

350
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,280
The living force is that which sprouts the seed.

351
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
The Mother earth sprouts the seed.

352
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,520
If you see the Mother Earth as it is, you don’t find anything in it, nothing.

353
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,360
There’s just clay.

354
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,360
But you put some seed

355
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,840
and that wasteful thing that you think of no use, this mud,

356
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,480
that gives that life to the seed,

357
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,960
and you find that the flowers become fruits,

358
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
automatically.

359
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,400
It’s a wondrous world,

360
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,080
if you start looking at the living work of the living force,

361
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,840
because we are not in connection with that, whatever we do,

362
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
we go into problems,

363
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,280
but the nature does not,

364
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,880
while we do. The reason is we have lost

365
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,560
our biological sustenance or process.

366
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,080
We are not biologically acting: it’s all dead action.

367
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,600
What we do is all dead. For example, as I told you before also

368
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,920
that something is dead, a tree is dead and you make a chair, then you think, ‘I have made this thing’.

369
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,000
From dead to dead to dead to dead,

370
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,320
and this dead sits on our head.

371
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
You make a chair, you cannot sit on the ground.

372
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,720
Then we start another thing like anti-culture business. That also just the same.

373
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,320
Like pendulum we may move.

374
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,760
Now, we don’t like democracy, to have communism.

375
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,720
From communism to democracy, democracy to communism,

376
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,480
there’s no movement!

377
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,480
Now what is the biological movement? Within us,

378
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,560
as you know, there are peptides [amino acids linked together] in our body,

379
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,920
and the biological movement of peptides is shown

380
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,600
when the movement is spiral.

381
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,040
When it is spiral then it’s biological,

382
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,480
and when it is linear then it is said that they have lost their biological sustenance.

383
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,000
They have no biological quality in them.

384
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
They have become linear.

385
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,040
So that sustenance within us, that spiral movement within us

386
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,960
is existing in our nerves,

387
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,680
but can become absolutely linear, leading to dead.

388
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,480
All of our mental projections are linear,

389
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
because we cannot, with that, in our own awareness,

390
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,840
in our own awareness, jump higher.

391
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,600
It is so outside.

392
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,280
For a man might say, think:

393
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,240
“Ah, I must try to improve the whole world, I must do this thing”.

394
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,680
There was a gentleman I met who is in charge of the peace of the world,

395
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,040
and the most disturbed personality I have ever come across, you see.

396
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
He was jumping this way, he was jumping this way,

397
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,880
every sort of disturbance was in his mind,

398
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,560
and he’s supposed to be in charge of the peace of the world; imagine.

399
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,400
Now what’s the matter with the gentleman?

400
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,880
Though he thinks of peace, he thinks of such big things,

401
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,560
he talks of higher ideals, everything.

402
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,400
What is it inside? There is nothing, no peace.

403
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,120
He’s just talking outside.

404
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,920
What is the reason?

405
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,240
The reason is it’s only linear.

406
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,480
He has accepted that he is in charge of the peace,

407
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,400
he must talk of big things, he must talk of ideal things,

408
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,240
and then the whole thing drops out.

409
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
We had League of Nations, now we have United Nations:

410
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
all flops.

411
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,080
So to make it spirally activated, what have we to do?

412
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,160
First of all we have to come to the right conclusion, understanding,

413
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,120
that whatever we have done so far has been linear in its action.

414
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,920
It’s not biological. We cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

415
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,240
No living action we can take.

416
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,520
We cannot perform any living action.

417
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,560
Once we understand that, then we have to know

418
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
that we have to become more

419
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,600
to be in connection with that living force,

420
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
that all-pervading force.

421
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,120
And to get to that all-pervading force, what have we to do?

422
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Actually what did we do to become human beings?

423
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,920
Nothing. We just became, spontaneously, Sahaja.

424
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,880
Sahaj: spontaneously.

425
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,360
It was just some force within us which worked it out,

426
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,040
that made us human beings. We didn’t do anything.

427
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,920
So one has to understand that if it is a living process,

428
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,480
then you don’t have to do anything about it.

429
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,400
It is effortless. This is very difficult for human beings to understand.

430
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,120
It is very difficult, because they live with their ego,

431
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,480
and they cannot accept that you cannot do it yourself.

432
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,920
They think, “We can do it ourselves”,

433
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,480
which is not possible.

434
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,080
It cannot be done.

435
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,880
You have to go to the Mother Earth to ask the seed to be sprouted.

436
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,320
You cannot sprout it. You may try to dissect it,

437
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,160
analyze it, put it under microscope,

438
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,960
but you cannot sprout it.

439
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,600
For sprouting, you have to surrender yourself to that Mother Earth who does the job.

440
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
To begin with, we have to understand

441
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,240
that we are not capable of doing any living work whatsoever.

442
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,040
Once we have that humility within us,

443
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
then we start seeing what can happen to us

444
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,320
by which we can become the masters of that living force.

445
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,040
To become something you have not done anything,

446
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,840
and to become higher you don’t have to do anything.

447
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:50,640
That means there is, built in within you, the complete mechanism

448
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,760
which is going to work it out.

449
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,080
Now before you, I would say, it’s like a hypothesis for you,

450
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,000
and you have to understand it as a scientist would understand, with an open mind,

451
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,680
because this is the science of the Divine.

452
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,480
It’s not known so far.

453
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,240
This is the knowledge of the roots,

454
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,320
not known to anyone so far, I can say.

455
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,760
But to [be] known to some people who have evolved themselves,

456
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,160
they have gone above that state that is just mental,

457
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,240
and these are the very few people who know what it is.

458
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,360
This knowledge is not of today; is of thousands of years,

459
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,920
but, is not the knowledge of the tree, as I told you, which we have,

460
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,160
but is the knowledge of the roots, which we have to understand.

461
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,560
The knowledge of the roots is that, within you is placed the root,

462
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,400
is called (Shri Mataji speaks aside to the yogis present: “Is it here? No, ah.

463
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,400
Somebody can come up, please.”)

464
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,640
Here, in the triangular bone is placed the thing called Kundalini.

465
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,080
It is a Sanskrit word. One should not be so frightened of Sanskrit.

466
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,080
I was surprised, when I went to America, the first question they asked me:

467
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,480
“Why should you come and teach us about these things

468
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,240
which were in your country?”

469
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,440
I said: “To Me, it is just the same

470
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,920
whether it is America or India.

471
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,480
Why did you come to India to teach us about science?”

472
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,720
Why this kind of an attitude people have?

473
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,000
Wherever there is knowledge, a humble person must go and seek it.

474
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,680
This was discovered about 14 000 years back,

475
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,360
where, in England, I don’t think people lived here, in this country.

476
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,560
So why should anybody feel humiliated?

477
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,360
When you think you are English, or you are American,

478
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,920
you are wrong. You are a human being.

479
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,160
God never made a world like that.

480
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
We are all one, and everybody has to support each other.

481
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,960
Like a flower thinks, “I am a flower”,

482
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,800
a leaf thinks, “I am a leaf”,

483
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,600
and the roots think they are roots,

484
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
then how the whole tree is going to manifest, just think?

485
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We are one,

486
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,080
there’s nothing that you are the tree,

487
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,200
and you are the leaf,

488
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,360
and you are the flower, and we are everything.

489
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,160
So to think like that if that, is another mental projection we have,

490
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,760
that “I am this” and “I am that”.

491
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,720
You are just a human being,

492
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,640
which has been created by God’s grace,

493
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,200
to this level, as the most beautiful thing,

494
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,920
the epitome, of His creation.

495
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I would say that, in the west, there are more seekers, perhaps,

496
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,960
than we have in the east, perhaps,

497
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,480
but that doesn’t mean that it is only because it is England,

498
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,800
or America,

499
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,480
but it is only that all over the world, God has this blessing

500
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,480
and the message for everyone.

501
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,680
So first of all we must understand that this is the knowledge of the roots,

502
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,600
and this knowledge of the roots, unless and until we know about it,

503
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,720
we have no right to criticize it.

504
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,840
Moreover, by criticizing you are not the gainer,

505
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,480
you are the loser.

506
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,360
So with complete openness of a student

507
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,320
we have to see to this, that this great force is placed within us,

508
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,040
in a triangular bone,

509
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,240
whether you are an Australian, American, English, Indian,

510
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,720
or coming from Timbuctoo.

511
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,560
All of you, if you are human beings,

512
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,960
God has placed this force within.

513
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,960
He doesn’t understand these differences, actually.

514
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
It’s only we do understand.

515
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,440
For Him it’s the one world, that beautiful world He has created,

516
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,720
and all the human beings are His children.

517
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,920
So in this triangular bone, is placed this beautiful thing

518
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,840
called the Kundalini,

519
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,120
and this Kundalini is the motherhood within you.

520
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
It’s a quality.

521
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,480
It has nothing to do with a woman or a man. It’s a quality,

522
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,360
is a type, a personality.

523
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,160
For example, I would say today, Mahatma Gandhi, people accept him

524
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,080
as a great man,

525
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,440
because he had the quality of compassion.

526
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,760
He had the quality of giving, of nourishing.

527
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,520
In the same way all the saints of the world had this quality.

528
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,880
They were motherly, full of compassion, love.

529
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,960
Christ had the same.

530
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,520
He was so full of compassion that you cannot call him, in the worldly way, a man,

531
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,880
because man means he must hate, he must aggress,

532
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,800
he must do all kinds of things to show his ego.

533
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,440
No. He was a personality who had compassion, who had nourishment.

534
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,400
Now to become that personality, what have we to do?

535
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,720
Again, say I, nothing, because it is all placed within you.

536
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,000
The expression of Kundalini within you is the expression of that great personality.

537
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,480
When that happens to you, you yourself become like the Mother Earth,

538
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,720
that you can give,

539
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,160
you can project yourself,

540
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,320
that you become compassion yourself and your compassion acts.

541
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,960
These days,

542
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,200
Kali Yuga is the modern times, what was the Kali Yuga, the days of confusion, is over,

543
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,800
and is called as Krita Yuga,

544
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,720
means where this living force will act,

545
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,800
and this living force has to act through you.

546
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,080
You become the medium of that living force.

547
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,840
Actually you become the master of that.

548
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,440
But the beauty of this is that it manifests within you also.

549
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,320
For example, the electricity is flowing through this; it doesn’t do anything to this instrument.

550
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,680
But when this force starts flowing through you, you get completely transformed

551
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,960
into a new personality,

552
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,320
and a personality that Christ had described that you are to be born again.

553
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,080
Again, linear way, is that artificially people can brand themselves

554
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,840
‘born again’.

555
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,800
But when it happens to [you] are completely transformed from within,

556
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,120
and the transformation is so visible,

557
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and so active, as Krita Yuga has started,

558
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,720
that you are amazed. You cannot believe, it is fantastic,

559
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,920
because you are fantastically made,

560
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,080
extremely fantastically made,

561
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,920
and that all things starts expressing itself

562
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,720
as soon as it manifests.

563
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,560
So a human being should know that he’s made with great care,

564
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,680
great love,

565
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,200
and for a very great thing:

566
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,560
is to enjoy the love of his Father.

567
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,920
When this Kundalini rises within you, passes through six chakras –

568
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,680
the seventh it does not cross; the seventh is the guard [Mooladhara chakra] -

569
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,160
then it creates that spiral movement within our awareness.

570
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,120
The awareness itself gets spirally formed,

571
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,080
and instead of moving in a pendulum

572
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,120
you move in such a way that you jump higher.

573
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,480
Your awareness becomes higher than what it used to be.

574
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,720
So the human awareness becomes higher.

575
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,920
There are lots of misunderstandings about this,

576
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,400
and it comes from the ignorance,

577
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,600
because when you start seeking something from ignorance,

578
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,080
what happens that whatever you find, is a partial truth

579
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,320
or could be something not the truth.

580
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,440
For example, in the darkness, you might see this

581
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
and think it’s a snake.

582
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,880
A wire might look like a snake to you.

583
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,280
But supposing you suddenly become enlightened.

584
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,360
Of course, in the beginning, light may not be that strong.

585
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,160
In some people it could be little bit,

586
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,200
just a flicker.

587
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,480
But you start seeing then,

588
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,960
and gradually, if the light improves,

589
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,760
and the lantern improves, I can say

590
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,360
then you start seeing it, very clearly, what has gone wrong with you,

591
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,080
and you start correcting it.

592
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,760
Now the new awareness that comes into you

593
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,840
is not something that can be just certified that,

594
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,080
“All right, now you are realized souls, have a brand and go ahead.”

595
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
It is not that way.

596
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,920
But you become conscious of that awareness,

597
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,680
because for the first time, when the Kundalini pierces

598
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,360
through this fontanelle bone area,

599
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,560
then you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

600
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,400
In the Sanskrit language, Holy Ghost is called as Adi Shakti.

601
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,720
Most surprising is that,

602
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,360
I don’t know why, but in the Bible,

603
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,320
Holy Ghost was not discussed much.

604
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Adi Shakti is the Holy Ghost,

605
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,320
and about Adi Shakti if you have to learn, you have to go to Indian Scriptures.

606
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,080
Even in the Old Testament they say Jews know about it.

607
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,720
Now this power,

608
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,560
which is the All-Pervading power of God,

609
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,280
the power of His Love,

610
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,320
becomes evident, because you start feeling it on your fingers.

611
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,360
And as you say in the English language,

612
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
you know, on your fingertips.

613
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,840
Your hands start speaking.

614
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,600
You can feel another personality,

615
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,000
you can put the hand towards another person,

616
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,480
and you can see

617
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,680
what are the centers catching, because

618
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,960
they are shown on this five, six and seven on the right,

619
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,920
five, six and seven on the left.

620
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,000
This is the emotional side,

621
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,520
and the right is the physical and the mental side.

622
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,560
Now the doctors cannot deal with the psychosomatic,

623
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,360
or psychological things,

624
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,520
and it’s a very big problem because there is only analysis going on.

625
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Now, for a doctor it is important to know

626
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,200
both the sides of human beings, or I would say the three sides:

627
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,720
the physical, the mental and the emotional.

628
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,480
But it is not so – he just knows part of it,

629
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,200
while a psychologist knows a part of it,

630
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,480
and that’s how we cannot find out the reason

631
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,200
for the problems that exist within us.

632
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,600
But when this Kundalini rises,

633
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,920
She passes through these six centers

634
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,200
which are the milestones of our evolution,

635
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,920
and thus integrates you completely.

636
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,480
So the first thing you receive is the integration.

637
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,360
By that integration you are amazed that

638
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,480
physically you get cured.

639
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,640
There has been a criticism about us

640
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,600
in the newspaper,

641
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,240
that we have started curing people.

642
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,720
Thank God we are not in America; there we would have been arrested,

643
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,520
because the doctors there do not allow anybody to cure anyone.

644
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,640
But we do not cure. Automatically it happens: when the Kundalini will rise,

645
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,520
automatically it will happen that your whole being itself

646
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,080
will become integrated by which you will be healed.

647
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
You will heal yourself, nobody else is going to heal you.

648
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,960
I don’t know under law if you can charge a person if he heals himself,

649
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,000
but this will exactly happen that you will heal yourself,

650
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,520
and you will know how to heal yourself.

651
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,720
But this is nothing.

652
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,360
Is not only the physical side of it that happens to you.

653
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,320
Is just the minimum of minimum.

654
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,000
But those people who (are?) suffering from mental trouble also get healed.

655
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,760
The third side of it is that physically you are all right,

656
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,720
mentally you are all right, and emotionally also, you are all right.

657
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,120
Now there’s a very big confusion about mental and emotional in English language.

658
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,600
So if you have to say ‘mental’ as the brain is concerned,

659
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,200
then they mean to say that person who is mad is a mental case.

660
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,880
Actually he’s a heart case,

661
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,160
because he’s working with his heart. He weeps, cries,

662
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,480
but his head goes off, it’s a balance.

663
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,800
When he’s working with his head too much, his heart goes off.

664
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,080
That’s another balance of the nature.

665
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,320
So if you have even the problem if you think too much,

666
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,280
some people are so mad that they go on thinking

667
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,200
like mad, they cannot stop their thinking,

668
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
they think, think, think, think,

669
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,600
and they’re thinking maddens them, but they cannot stop it.

670
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,160
So here, when the Kundalini rises, onto this point,

671
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
you become thoughtlessly aware.

672
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,320
You don’t have to think; you can stop your thoughts.

673
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,640
If you want to think you can think, if you want to stop, you can stop.

674
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,520
It is not necessary for you to think,

675
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,560
and that’s exactly what happens

676
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,840
when the Kundalini rises here, that mentally you become absolutely comfortable.

677
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,400
Now this business

678
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,080
of raising the Kundalini

679
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,640
is a business of God,

680
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,160
and which cannot be sold.

681
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,920
You cannot have a business on the human level. You cannot sell it.

682
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,040
You just cannot do it.

683
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,680
How it happens is automatically.

684
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,960
By the grace of God it works out.

685
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,040
You cannot sell anything that is the grace of God.

686
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,680
What is the value of that?

687
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,520
On this point only many people discard Sahaja Yoga

688
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,000
because they think that it cannot be sold so it must be useless.

689
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,280
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay for it.

690
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,320
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take place, first of all.

691
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,200
But with these three advantages the fourth advantage is the highest:

692
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,080
That you become the Spirit.

693
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,440
The Spirit is the one who is the master in you.

694
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,480
So you become your own master, you become your own guru.

695
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,280
Nobody has to tell you ‘do this’ or ‘do that’;

696
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,600
you are guided,

697
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,760
because as soon as the Kundalini rises,

698
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,720
you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands.

699
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,480
And these are giving you a new vibrations,

700
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,320
a new dimension

701
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,920
by which you know whether to do this or not.

702
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,440
For example, you want to do something; you want to buy a book.

703
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,640
You don’t have to decide about it:

704
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,880
as soon as you go near the book either it will give you cool breeze,

705
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,720
or it may make you hot, or it may little bit burn also if it’s a horrid one,

706
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,200
and you don’t want to have that at any cost, you want to have the cool breeze

707
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,440
because you enjoy it.

708
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,800
So you just give up.

709
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,440
You just give up things without anybody telling you,

710
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,720
because your vibrations tell you.

711
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,960
The spirit that has now shine in your attention,

712
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,360
tells you, and you start understanding,

713
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,040
that now I have become my own guru,

714
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,080
because your guru is sitting inside you as the Spirit.

715
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,880
It has not yet manifested in your attention and that’s why you’re worried.

716
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,440
But just it manifests,

717
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,760
and once it manifests you are amazed,

718
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,800
that you yourself may have become a guru of yourself.

719
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,880
You don’t need anybody else to tell you, but you can do it yourself.

720
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,320
You can find out yourself. Nobody has to give any explanation,

721
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,320
or correction, or anything,

722
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,320
you just start improving yourself. Automatically it works,

723
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,880
and little bit, if you know,

724
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,680
how to decode it, and how to work it out, your problems,

725
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,400
you just manage it.

726
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,440
You become yourself a guru.

727
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,760
That’s the thing you have to be.

728
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,720
Of course I told you, you cannot pay for it.

729
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,960
It’s an insult even to think that you can pay for it.

730
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,080
Nobody can understand this;

731
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,640
that this is complete benevolence, is complete.

732
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,320
It’s not mercenary act of benevolence,

733
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,000
but it is a complete, absolute benevolence,

734
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,320
and for this benevolence you cannot pay.

735
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,040
As soon as you pay for it, it is no more of benevolence.

736
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,240
And that’s why you cannot pay for it.

737
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,400
You cannot work it out, it has to just work out.

738
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Now, especially in the west, there is a problem with people that they think,

739
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,520
“Why should Mother do it?”

740
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,120
I tell you, it’s a thankless job.

741
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,320
You cannot do it. If you can do it, I’ll be happy to retire.

742
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,000
But you cannot do it. That’s the point.

743
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,320
This is my job, what am I to do?

744
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,960
Supposing I am that, what am I to do now?

745
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,920
If I have to do it,

746
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,920
if I am supposed to do it, then what should I do?

747
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,080
I mean supposing you are posted as something; you are a policeman,

748
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,720
you have to do the policeman’s job.

749
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,240
Now, how can you challenge it?

750
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,280
He has to do it.

751
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,640
As if you can say, I’m paid for it, or you can say that

752
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,200
this is my job.

753
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:13,320
This I have to do, though I know it is very, very troublesome.

754
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,560
To get it done is not easy,

755
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,240
it’s not very easy.

756
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,320
Everyone may not get realization,

757
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,120
I cannot guarantee that.

758
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,240
I cannot say that you all will get the realization,

759
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,120
it’s a very difficult thing.

760
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,720
Some people will just miss it for some time.

761
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,720
There’s nothing to be worried about it;

762
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,600
it has to be corrected. It has to be redeemed, as they say.

763
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,520
The Kundalini has to be brought up,

764
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,960
if there are centers catching they have to be cleared out, they have to be brought up,

765
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,800
and we have to have complete understanding

766
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,080
and compassion about ourselves,

767
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,480
and love for ourself and respect for ourself.

768
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,720
That if you have to become the light,

769
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,880
then we have to adjust and cooperate.

770
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,400
Now the thing is that

771
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,800
the ego part of it is the strongest enemy of realization.

772
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
I.

773
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,320
I like it. I am this, I am that.

774
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,760
When you say of ‘I, it is not yourself,

775
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,200
your spirit, but it is your ego that’s saying ‘I’.

776
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,520
When you become the spirit you don’t say ‘I’,

777
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,640
but you say ‘it’.

778
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,360
You talk in the third person.

779
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,400
You say, ‘It is not coming up, it is not working out, it is not’,

780
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,720
in a third way.

781
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,080
You never say, ‘I will raise the Kundalini’.

782
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,760
What you will say: ‘the Kundalini is not coming up.

783
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,320
The Kundalini is not there.’ In a third person you start talking,

784
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,040
so that you do not take any credit or discredit for it.

785
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,480
Now, it is for you to observe it

786
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,280
and see for yourself. It depends on your power of observation.

787
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:00,560
Whatever doctors may tell you, or anything, you don’t have to believe those,

788
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,720
because it depends on your own observation

789
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,040
and sense of penetration.

790
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,240
Like I would say, I went to the Union Society

791
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,640
and the Chairman of the Union Society was 82-year-old man.

792
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,840
And he got his realization.

793
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,520
And I told about Jung’s mistake why he missed the point,

794
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
which they understood very well.

795
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,400
But then he got up, very humbly, and he says,

796
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,920
“Mother, now you have learned our language,

797
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,480
let us talk your language, let us learn your language”.

798
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,240
And then at the second meeting he says, ‘Now I have observed –

799
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,480
it’s not a question, but my observation, if it is true – that you don’t believe in time.

800
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,800
There’s no time.’ Just you give it like that.

801
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,040
That depends on your own observation.

802
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,560
But I would not like to accept any ideas about Me

803
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,080
because I know it is terrible;

804
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,720
sometimes it can act against. I mean, some people may just leave, you know,

805
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,280
they can’t bear it anymore.

806
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,040
So that’s not the point. You have to see for yourself, observe yourself.

807
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,760
There’s nothing to gain from you, at all for Me,

808
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,400
you cannot give Me anything, whatever you may try.

809
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,400
There’s nothing to ask for.

810
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,920
It is you who have to take something from Me which you better have it.

811
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,320
I’m like a cashier on the bank, see?

812
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,840
You have got your cheques.

813
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,320
Now, I have nothing to get from you.

814
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,560
The cashier is paid for, all right, that’s one point, is different, from the employer,

815
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,280
but not by you.

816
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,400
And what I have to do is to take your cheques and cash it.

817
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:39,200
Now, when you are in that position, will you be angry with me for that?

818
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,040
Will you say to your cashier, “Why are you doing this to me?

819
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,720
Why should I take money from you?”

820
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,120
If that is intelligible,

821
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,880
then we can see there is some meeting point between us,

822
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,520
and we can talk of realization then in a way that it has to be done.

823
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,120
You all have to have your key,

824
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,240
your spirit, that is within you.

825
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,720
Perhaps I know that better than you.

826
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,200
You know many things better than Me.

827
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,080
I don’t know even how to use a plastic bag,

828
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,760
but I know how to open the Kundalini.

829
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,360
I am so hopelessly bad at so many things which are so trivial and simple

830
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,440
which you can do just like that, I cannot do it.

831
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,800
So it’s all right,

832
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,400
so, I am also quite humble about it, I don’t mind.

833
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,560
I don’t know many things, but I know one thing, is that you are the Spirit,

834
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,440
and you have to become the Spirit,

835
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,960
through the awakening of your Kundalini.

836
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,160
This is what a Mother can do,

837
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:46,080
is to explain to you, that come to the right conclusion, that you have to have it,

838
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,920
it is within you, and you have to get it.

839
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,600
But I cannot force it on you.

840
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,080
I cannot make you take it.

841
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,920
Or else if you do not want to have it I just can’t do it.

842
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,440
It’s impossible. There’s no hypnosis in it.

843
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,720
It’s a happening that has to take place with complete understanding of your freedom.

844
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,280
I hope you will understand this new method,

00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,960

00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,720
and to become that subtler being, you have to become the Spirit,

848
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,480
your Kundalini has to be awakened.
