1
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:21,880
I saw that but I haven't read it I don't read it

2
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:50,410
it's this photograph I saw good
so they can read it thank you

3
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:20,520
happy Easter to y'all so we celebrate Easter to
show how Christ resurrected resurrected himself

4
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:41,430
the spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of
the material manifestation of the divine itself

5
00:02:41,430 --> 00:03:07,440
the matter is manifested because we ourselves
have created it not that we are born out of

6
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:19,560
matter our body but we are attached to it we
want to want to have it whatever you want that

7
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:32,360
sustains itself by your desire because
now you are on the stage if you want to

8
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:42,440
sustain the matter if you want to keep the
matter as the first priority it will remain

9
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:56,480
it cannot disappear it has to go out of your
mind that matter cannot hold you any further

10
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:06,470
Christ rose out of the matter came out of the
tomb which symbolizes the matter which has in

11
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:16,880
enclosed us within which has to be open
out with our spiritual power throw away

12
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:26,870
throw with a stone that is covering this
grave get out of that and stand outside

13
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:42,530
this is the message of Christ's resurrection
the tomb that we have created we have created

14
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:55,460
ourselves because we have allowed people
to dominate us we have allowed them to make

15
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:10,130
these graves for us we have allowed them to bury
Christ within ourselves because we were afraid

16
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:28,570
but Christ has to rise so we create our
own matter through our conditionings

17
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:36,220
through our fears through our absolute
wrong ideas about goodness and kindness

18
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:44,470
and compassion in the light of the
Spirit you can see what we think as

19
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:53,050
compassion is nothing but a kind of
a sympathy which leads you nowhere

20
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,290
but one should learn to see everything in the
light of the Spirit but do we use all the time

21
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:16,960
the light of the Spirit we do not for Christ it
was not difficult, because he was the Spirit but he

22
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:29,650
has shown you the way he crucified himself to show
you the way all the ideas about sophistication

23
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:46,300
about our standing in the society how we relate
ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country

24
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:56,680
to our politics to our economics and the world I
draw large all of them can tied us down to that

25
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:07,540
tomb you belong to another category I have told
you hundred times I'm in a category which is a

26
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:19,510
spirit which can rise about all the tools and
throw everything this way you are conditioned

27
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:27,580
all absurd ideas have been accepted which you
cannot explain why you were conditioned like this

28
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:40,080
why I talk more of conditioning because of
England English are very much conditioned

29
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,600
people the others are Americans were abundant
I mean you can't talk to them about anything

30
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,830
because they cannot be rooted in toilet but
English had too much conditioned people and

31
00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:03,660
when they are too much conditioned they build
their own tools all these ideas are to be seen

32
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:19,560
with a new dimension of awareness that you have
you are the spirit why should you worry about

33
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:29,190
anything else but your vibrations because you're
saying I should just worry about the comfort of

34
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:40,290
your spirit whatever congenial to your spirit just
worn doing that observing that accumulating that

35
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,170
and settling within yourself all conditionings
will run away because these conditionings you

36
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,950
accept because they look comfortable
they look comfortable but they are not

37
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:03,170
Christ is a great example and he fee is the
one whom you follow if he is the one who may

38
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,980
have understood and recognized in the light of
your spirit then you must know why why did he

39
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,780
go into the grave first of all the man was so
powerful who when he'll come he'll reduce all

40
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:26,240
of them into ashes such a great personality
like him of a kadesha rudra why did Christ

41
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:35,840
allowed himself to be crucified and to
be married into that because he wanted

42
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,300
to stoop down to the level of other people to
come down to that level so that people should

43
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:52,220
see that through his life is shown that you
can be resurrected now the resurrection has

44
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,670
taken place Sergio keys are resurrected no
doubt but still in one foot is in the green

45
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:14,120
and the second one I don't know whether it will
be outdoor if it is just half way through one

46
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,140
foot is of course outside no doubt but still is
not yet touching the ground and the other one

47
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,670
cannot be lifted and listen to push the
ground this matter again to push it out

48
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,840
if you live with your spirit you should have
no fears should have no worry see now I'll

49
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:47,930
tell you how God is showing his ways here like
in Dharam the fellow is now under complete fire

50
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:56,120
he's our know what to do and himself is so
stupid and senseless saying is that Vanaja

51
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:02,090
Kali predictably when your destruction
time comes you think of all perverted

52
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:07,640
things before it Aboudi so he's done if
you I mean see to the way he speaks I

53
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:15,230
mean blasphemous and he is under fire he
himself lit the fire and now sitting on

54
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,420
top of it and now when he gets the heat the
heated words come out of his mouth we don't

55
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,010
have to do anything it's all done already
they are baked and cooked in their own

56
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:43,980
so why should we have fear but we should
know what is right and what is wrong

57
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:54,270
that's only possible because you are with the
absolute that is the spirit and related to the

58
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,580
absolute if you do everything related to they
are doing the right thing if you are related

59
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,430
to Christ how can he do wrong that's one of the
proofs that they are not Christians of anything

60
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:13,050
because none of the Christian organizations
have done anything good whatsoever except

61
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:26,130
for creating fire for themselves so you can see
clearly how this conditioning has worked within

62
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,070
us because we have been so-called Christians
we have been going to churches we have been

63
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,530
worshipping Christ as they told us the way they
told us we worshipped him everything regimented

64
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:52,770
the one who came to resurrect us from the
bondage of the grave we used him to build

65
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:10,410
our graves now you are out of it thank God
but take out the other foot fast this is one

66
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:16,290
advantage you have because you have Christ
before you but also there's a disadvantage

67
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:26,700
because Christ has been used to shut you down
in the grave so change your concept about Christ

68
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:35,040
know him through your vibrations what he was
I mean as a child I knew what was going wrong

69
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,380
with Christians and left and right little girl
like me about seven years to give big lectures

70
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:48,420
even when I was baptized I was horrified
the way I was baptized by some stupid fellow

71
00:13:51,490 --> 00:14:00,190
I didn't know what was he up to and then he
put a booth on my head I think or something

72
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:07,540
which hovered round and we met with and very
big accident I fell down this booth must have

73
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:17,110
put it in the horse ID but rather booth this
priest the super stupid fellow he belonged to

74
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,340
the Lutheran Church I don't know what you call
through of that Lutheran imagine Martin Luther's

75
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:29,650
Church and that's how they baptized me I D I
knew all about it but I didn't know what to do

76
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:44,260
I must have kicked him quite a lot but whatever
it is so far he baptized me I had to accept all

77
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:51,820
foolish stupid things in this life because I had
to show I was quite normal me not being accepting

78
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:01,660
stupid is normal these days and to tolerate an
idiot is even more normal so I had to show that

79
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:13,750
I knew very well what sort of a thing it was this
fellow was up to and I accepted the nonsense he

80
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:26,530
did and many other things I accepted just to show
that I am nothing special but I knew all about it

81
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:34,150
and when I saw the way Christ
was described I was aghast I

82
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,540
said what are they doing to Christ for
me nicely second crucifixion going on

83
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:55,600
we also know about it thank God there are so
many to whom I can talk and they understand

84
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:04,240
my language but the resurrection will not
be complete unless and until you pull out

85
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,950
many out of their grace I don't know how
you'll go about it look at this fellow

86
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:18,820
Dharam who get such a publicity when he's
doing all blasphemous thing he's getting

87
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:27,490
all the credit and kudos from people what
about us what are we doing why not we write

88
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:34,090
to the newspapers why not we talk to them
Observer has given us a clue I think there's

89
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:40,510
one gentleman mr. Wilson he wrote it quite
nicely why not try to him some letters get we

90
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:59,770
because you see what I am little
concerned about this matter is as

91
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:05,650
it is they're half-hearted Christians now
if this Durham fellow speaks like that who

92
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,560
is now the big a 30 on Christianity Christ
his mother and everybody else mr. Dharam

93
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,800
and now this fellow if he goes on like this
those who are half-baked will already fall

94
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:26,560
off to communism and the rest of them
who may remain also they may accept him

95
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:40,360
so the Anglicans anglo-saxon brain
i am saying is going to accept mr.

96
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,920
Dharam very well I can see that
or else they will just leave and

97
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,200
become communists I have nothing to do
with this God who has so many problems

98
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:02,080
so in the seminar of yours in Birmingham when
you have I would like you to think over this

99
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:10,180
new thing that has come up in the heart of the
universe everyone knows about Durham fellow they

100
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:17,440
know his plight everything but what about us
we are so many let us try to find out how we

101
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:26,140
can talk to these people sensibly talk to these
Anglicans find out about them and communicate

102
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:33,040
to them what you have found out you need not say
in the beginning only that I am the ADI Shakti or

103
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:43,210
I am the Redeemer and the comforter that Christ
has said but we can start talking about find out

104
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:49,300
these people these Anglicans church people church
goers would believe in God who believe in Christ

105
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,530
I mean they are voting can you imagine they are
voting here whether Christ was true or not can

106
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:14,160
you vote like that you feel you are in a lunatic
asylum or what it's terrible they're taking words

107
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:25,800
can you imagine such a thing like that at this
moment we have an advantage because they are

108
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,720
so much confused to give them concrete idea as
to what is God what is Christ what is religion

109
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:39,540
one side I feel very hurt unhappy I think
these three days I have gone through real

110
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:50,820
resurrection myself the way things have been about
Christ just I can't bear it and it is too much

111
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:02,190
you all should be stirred also should be
concerned and you must go through it and

112
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:11,280
see what you can do and tell them are you all
mad or what why don't you listen to sanity as

113
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,990
you know when I went to Australia it's a
different country altogether they're much

114
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:27,180
more sensible people than you are I think the
way they were exiled they learnt a lesson and

115
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:36,750
they are better so I feel the English have to go
into exile or jail for a while to understand it

116
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:46,260
there are very sensible extremely sensible
people you can talk to them sense everyone

117
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:54,330
the media is sensible the people are sensible
thousands of them came they repeated no first

118
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:02,340
program we had once it was 1,600 2000 can you
imagine such people and out of them repeats for

119
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:10,230
600 now for the last how many years we are
having the same 600 people again and again

120
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,390
what seminars are we going to do all of us
eating and cooking some chicken that's what

121
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:29,030
or making some cake for mother which
she doesn't eat let us take out our

122
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:37,580
satisfactions from these little lazy theme
into something bigger let us talk about it

123
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:48,470
without fear we have to go and talk and
tell people about it take it a big way

124
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:56,150
there should be no hindrance on this point we are

125
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,570
a very big group we can assert
and we can talk and meet people

126
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:22,590
the situation has improved a lot because now
I have to go to India as you know and in India

127
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:32,010
for me the situation is much better it's not
at all difficult as you know I went to the

128
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:40,680
hills at the foothills of Himalayas but three
thousand people came from all over the little

129
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:48,150
dirty villages that they had they didn't take
even a second to recognize me they were singing

130
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:57,690
the praise of the goddess of the hills goddess
of the Tigers goddess of the Lions this started

131
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:05,280
singing my place without any lecture or anything
we were all joyous that I've been there and they

132
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,630
knew Anna they accepted me and finished I have
to just put my foot down there and I've done

133
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:22,470
Jaipur they said mother you just put your foot
here oh really so for me the situation is very

134
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,100
good in India now let's see what you people
are going to do with these big big seminars and

135
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:41,250
lectures why not get some outsiders to listen
to you invite them invite these intellectuals

136
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,410
try to talk to them tell them what is it
what do you call them those who know about

137
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:08,900
Bible what how theologians see or what
najin's without logics theologians call

138
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:24,020
these theologians challenge them why not put
a challenge we are not alone you are so many

139
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,790
and don't tell them you wear saris when you come

140
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:41,950
for my puja they won't understand it they
are not that deep you can wear your jeans

141
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:55,830
or to convince them more you can be punks that
would have bring them better you go with your

142
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:08,640
funky conditions their jolly well have to listen
to the otherwise they are in for trouble if they

143
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,790
had that stupid why not handle them it's very
easy to handle a stupid person than to handle

144
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:22,020
a person who is not who is not stupid nor who
is clever stupid can be stupefied very easy

145
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:34,170
so I think we have to change our course
we have to take it in a big way the whole

146
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:39,240
thing what we are going to do all of you
should give some concrete ideas as to what

147
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:47,820
you would like to do and that would be
really the way it will work out so now

148
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:57,690
in the seminar you must discuss more how to
talk to these people how to create a platform

149
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:05,160
for sahaja yoga find out how do they create
a platform out of nothing like this bunks

150
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:22,100
and once you do all these things you will be
surprised that they will have to listen they'll

151
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:30,380
have to listen now go full ahead I'm giving you
all freedom do what you want except for telling

152
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,500
them that I am Adi Shakti that they won't be able
to digest that an Indian has become now the ADI

153
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:58,970
Shakti they think now additionally has to be an
English lady at least French so don't patient

154
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,940
me if you want you can but don't mention me as
guru or anything but you should succeed that lady

155
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:12,500
who showed us the way and or something like that
not referring much to me but to them I think you

156
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,960
should go ahead with it and work it out because
now we have had lot of patience and all nonsense

157
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:26,480
going round us better tell them or are you going
to allow all of them to go to hell direct message

158
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,480
of Easter East comes from East I don't know why
they call it Easter and we were thought of it

159
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,520
why do they call it a Worcester sauce I don't know

160
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,470
I don't know why they call
anything anything but Easter

161
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:58,270
you can't explain you know like
her screen you don't know so I

162
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,820
don't know but Eastern it is coming from the east

163
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:09,340
the wisdom has to come from the east the
resurrection has to come from the east

164
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:22,840
whether they like it or not and that is the
message of Easter today that let us give them

165
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,920
the chance of resurrection by talking to them
all of you should make it a pun go and talk to

166
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,770
people who are in charge of theology churches
Bibles go and talk to them tell them what are

167
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:42,130
you doing I remind why I want to die why do you
want to be sleep people do not know anything

168
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:53,380
another thing I would suggest that we should have
regular classes to understand sahaja yoga properly

169
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:01,810
I have seen some people who are sahaja Yogi's
for years don't know anything about sahaja yoga

170
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:10,540
even in Bombay people told that some of the late
these are absolutely zero as far as sahaja Yoga

171
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,960
is concerned they don't understand what is sahaja
Yogi's they don't understand what is what are what

172
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,980
are the chakras are they listen to your lecture
everything and then like a bubble the whole thing

173
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,230
disappears from their minds I don't know who gave
them these ideas but they were quite shocked so

174
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,780
let us have a class like thing for sahaja Yogi's
two different topics and subjects let us work it

175
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:40,630
out recently you must be knowing there's a book
going to be published by Yogi Bhajan called Neeta

176
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,850
enlightened which is a very good book of course
I mean most of it I have had three Mary's being

177
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,930
with me and all that but doesn't matter but
he's understood the subject the other day they

178
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:58,660
published a very beautiful book in Marathi once
soraka such a lovely book he wrote that in the

179
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:08,230
light of gana shuara what is sahaja yoga and it's
written it so well that anybody was a theologian

180
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:15,940
or anything like in India will be impressed by
I wish I could translate that book for you but

181
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:25,150
it's all the stands us from Ganesha para which
is in Marathi language wrote such a nice book

182
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:31,270
on sahaja yoga and that is what he gave me on
my birthday is that something so substantial I

183
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:40,240
felt and once it reaches into the hands of any
one of these people I mean it will in any case

184
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:50,260
and he published himself he brought some copies
gave it to me and all the copies were sold out

185
00:30:50,260 --> 00:31:00,700
in that program every copy was sold out for two
rupees each so this is what we have to do now is

186
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:07,090
to write write two different magazines meet people
tell them we want to come and talk to you first of

187
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,940
all you must know about sahaja yoga you should
be well equipped it's not that you can show my

188
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:21,400
photograph with a light here that's not sufficient
what is the light here also you have to show only

189
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:28,510
few people know what is sahaja yoga the rest of
you don't know anything let us see what questions

190
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:37,180
we have in our mind let us sit down and find
out what are the questions what questions are we

191
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,340
lacking in what we have to understand in sahaja
yoga what part we don't know let's find out all

192
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:49,120
those things all the details let us write it down
every one of you whether it's a woman man child

193
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:57,160
everyone can do it find out what are the questions
which are not yet answered in sahaja yoga how can

194
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:04,810
we answer particular questions all right all these
things can be found out if you put your attention

195
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:11,650
to it you can easily find out what you need
everyone has to do it you must be all equipped

196
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,230
if anybody asks you a question about sahaja
yoga and if you cannot answer I mean how can you

197
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,680
convince people you take one ordinary so-called
lay man for Christianity so-called Christianity

198
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:31,390
again the man is lemon and the Christianity is
also lame he will give a big lecture on Christ

199
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:43,150
every verse the Bible is telling chapter Matthew's
2 verse 2 this is what Christ I said that you'll

200
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:55,330
be calling me Christ Christ and I will not
recognize you telling about himself only so

201
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:01,780
you have to be absolutely equipped for it now
you have to also know what will confront in a

202
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,530
particular country for example when I come
to England I know I have to confront these

203
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:12,040
theologians and the Christ and everything if I go
to India what I have to confront I know I have to

204
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:21,640
face it on different lines and different fronts
you don't have to do that just think about your

205
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,310
own country for French have to think about France
you people have to think about this country and

206
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:35,380
then go ahead with it you can chalk out a good
program and work it out properly I'm sure by

207
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,350
God's grace everything you work out because when
are we going to do it now I am going away as I

208
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,240
told you to India and I don't know when will
I be back you wanted to arrange my program

209
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,480
to England in England but I think I cannot do it
because I have to go around to all the places you

210
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,070
know pan all that finished that you better do that
during when I was not here what Turing did you do

211
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:18,110
nothing you could have taught now at least these
three months when we are having a nice summer

212
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:25,610
time I'll be traveling all over Europe everywhere
you please see that you go around England visit

213
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:31,700
different places arrange programs talk to people
find out who are the big Johnny said the mayor

214
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:40,100
stays that go and talk to them tell them about
this that is how new programming should be done

215
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:47,180
and a new dimension should be given to our sahaja
yoga propaganda you have done no propaganda in the

216
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:53,900
right sense in the sense that we were not so much
sure about it that will work out but now we weigh

217
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:01,880
because people are writing there's an atmosphere
against rice so we have to fight and that's how we

218
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,890
should become the people who are fighting for
Christ now there could be areas where you can

219
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:16,700
talk of integration of talking about how we do
not know much about Christ that we have to go to

220
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:22,580
other books to find out who he was why did he come
on this earth we have to go much deeper we have

221
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,470
to prove that there is divine power and you have
seen how divine power works what wonders there are

222
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,180
you take my photographs show them these are the
photographs can you explain these things that in

223
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:44,690
the hand you see the Sun show us in mrs. Thatcher
science even a star won't drink all these things

224
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:52,100
are to be seen in the right perspective and at
the right time we must do whatever is right at

225
00:35:52,100 --> 00:36:01,520
that point that is the way sahaja Yoga is hit
the point when it is to be hit if you cannot

226
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,010
do that way you cannot achieve so this is the
right time for you these are now three months

227
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,140
ahead of you I would like you to see what you
can do because now the Sun will be coming out

228
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,150
we'll have a nice summer go ahead but now just
do not fix all your holiday during these three

229
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:30,460
three months going to some beach somewhere so
Yogi's have no time they are busy people they

230
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:42,040
have no time to waste we are on about a warpath
we have no time to quarrel among ourselves fight

231
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:51,220
we have to fight very great enemies we have no
time to waste on our families and our children

232
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:58,510
and our relations and father mother sister
brother we are on a warpath very important

233
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:07,030
so let us now prepare ourselves as Christ stood
out of that grave let us get out of this grave

234
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:21,100
of lethargy of compromising of comfort of our
past ideas about life's pleasures this is the

235
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:31,960
new era that has to show its manifestation in
this country it's very important and you all can

236
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:40,510
do it you have to be very brave you have to be
self similar wise kind and also forthright but

237
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,640
you have to say what you have to say because it
has to be said and this is the only thing to be

238
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,970
said nothing else is important whatever these
people talk about has no meaning they are not

239
00:37:51,970 --> 00:38:03,040
mantras some of them are anti-god some may not be
but they are useless wasteful garbage s I should

240
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,910
say why they are given so much importance and
not the real thing that is there you understand

241
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:22,500
that this is the reality that is come into you
people actually you are Felda reality actually

242
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:35,640
you know the reality you are in the reality
why not talk about it why should we not is

243
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:42,810
it not the most important thing that we have
to do if you realize it I'm sure it will work

244
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:51,630
out with all my blessings with all my love
I really command you to do that now may God

245
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:05,570
today on this day you all should Wow Wow
that we are on the warpath and we are

246
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,800
going to find out ways and methods of doing
this thing for these three months we are

247
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:18,590
going to work it out just bow just ask for
wisdoms and the spiritual power that's all

248
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:29,870
and promise it to Christ that
as you did we are going to do

249
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,410
may God bless

250
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,350
so many steaks

251
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,010
this is too much coming up in
less than three there are two

252
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,330
each of them their one year wonder
should be less than his burns better

253
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:21,370
when are you having your seminar weeks

254
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:34,260
I mean I would like to plan out my visit to
Southside London after this Birmingham mistake

255
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:43,230
and please ask the sahaja Yogi's abroad I mean
in the European countries how they would like me

256
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:54,990
to do it so that say Birmingham will be over by
the end of April middle of April then we can do

257
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:00,900

02:46:53,050 --> 02:47:04,691
in Paris and one week in Lyon good and all the
families some days I'm very optimistic some day

542
02:47:12,051 --> 02:47:18,950
we have started discourse mother you know
I spoke to you before about this all so we

543
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:29,810
have an initiation course to start your garden
the deepening course and actually we have few

544
02:47:29,811 --> 02:47:35,631
people who are following it in this quite quite
serious about it and in sahaja Yogi's that as to

545
02:47:35,631 --> 02:47:38,811
make any photo so because they have to give
the cost now - they have to know about such

546
02:47:38,811 --> 02:47:44,871
oh god that's that's working out with what
do you think of starting the course here

547
02:47:45,989 --> 02:47:56,789
and but we have we have been frankly a beginning
we are asking them to pay for participation and

548
02:47:56,789 --> 02:48:02,640
spaying then that is only because we give them
some tapes and papers and all that so they can

549
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:10,199
read about sahaja yoga but we use it for that to
further the books the use and the tapes we give

550
02:48:10,199 --> 02:48:18,659
them tapes of your tapes mother and as very cheap
action it's the gesture but I think like that they

551
02:48:18,659 --> 02:48:23,279
did start and finish the course so that means
the course is three months mother so for Amelia

552
02:49:11,060 --> 02:49:24,260
I believe to whatever this is for Austria
those who want to go are very welcome there

553
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:44,239
Austria now we have a new arsenal what
about Italy now whatever you have decide

554
02:49:44,239 --> 02:49:52,039
only one thing you asked us to if you could
come in 15 days in Paris it could be done

555
02:49:52,039 --> 02:49:59,329
but if we have little more time a bit you
know it may distill your mother April may

556
02:49:59,329 --> 02:50:05,899
end of method for example I don't need of
after maybe sastra I'm just saying we can

557
02:50:05,899 --> 02:50:09,889
do it in 15 days but if you really
want to make your coming successful

558
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:24,520
we do the better

559
02:50:27,660 --> 02:50:52,260
