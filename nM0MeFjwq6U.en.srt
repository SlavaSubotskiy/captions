1
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:31,691
Now we all have realized
by this time,

2
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:42,191
within us lies the peace, the beauty,
the glory of our being.

3
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:46,281
There's an ocean of all
that.

4
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:50,861
We cannot seek it outside,

5
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,821
we have to go within,

6
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,941
what they call in
the meditative state,

7
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:04,151
you seek it, you enjoy it.

8
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,941
Like when you are thirsty,

9
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:16,571
you go to a river or you
go to a ocean,

10
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:23,401
and try to quench
your thirst.

11
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:28,731
But even the ocean cannot
give you sweet water.

12
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:39,691
So how can anything
that is spread outside

13
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,941
give you that deep thing
that is within you?

14
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:51,731
You are trying to find it outside,
where it does not lie.

15
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:57,281
It is within us, absolutely
with in us.

16
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:04,991
It is so simple because
it is your own

17
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:08,111
it is within your reach,

18
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,401
just there.

19
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:16,941
What ever you have
been doing

20
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:22,731
going out to find
the joy,

21
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:27,241
the so called joy,
the so called happiness,

22
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:38,281
the so called glory of worldly
powers and wordly possessions,

23
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:44,991
you have to reverse it back
the whole thing.

24
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:51,191
You have to project
within yourself.

25
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,281
It was not wrong
that you went out,

26
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:59,821
it was not correct
that you went out,

27
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:05,941
shouldn't feel sorry for what
you have done so far.

28
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:10,731
It was not the correct
way

29
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:16,901
to get to the real joy
of life,

30
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,151
the real glory of your
being.

31
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:28,151
It has worked in so
many people

32
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:34,111
that you have entered into
that subtler understanding.

33
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,491
Some people are only at a mental
level, maybe, doesn't matter.

34
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:44,531
Maybe, some are only at a physical
level that they can feel it,

35
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:48,821
doesn't matter. But, you are
on the correct lines

36
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,991
you are moving correctly.

37
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,861
Try to meditate,

38
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:59,991
meditate more so that you
reach your inner being.

39
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:04,191
And this inner being, is the
vast ocean of bliss,

40
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:08,321
which exists in
every one of us.

41
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:13,941
Is that vast glorifying
flood of light

42
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:20,491
that floods everybody's
inner beauty.

43
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,611
So to approach it,

44
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:32,651
you have to go within yourself
by denying things,

45
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:37,191
which are against it,
against your movement.

46
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:42,861
Sometimes the wind can be
very, very strong for you

47
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:47,111
to misunderstand

48
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:58,651
that the glory of God
is within.

49
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,781
The turn back,

50
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:11,071
every moment remember that
your movement has to be inward.

51
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:17,191
When you move inward

52
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:22,821
you forget the ideas of your
outer glories.

53
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:27,821
A person, who is of a very
base nature,

54
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:30,111
thinks that if he makes
a lot of money

55
00:06:30,361 --> 00:06:33,901
then he has achieved
joy, but he has not.

56
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,731
He's the most unhappy person,
if you go and see him.

57
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:40,941
He's worried about small,
small things of life.

58
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,241
You must have heard that people
who are very rich

59
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,151
are kleptomaniacs.

60
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,611
They're worried, they're
very miserly,

61
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,401
they're worried about a needle
here and there.

62
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,321
A little thing missing they
get upset.

63
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:59,491
They have so many habits that
they can't live without it.

64
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:06,151
So riches have brought always
a curse on human beings.

65
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:11,491
So those who seek only
the riches

66
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,151
cannot enjoy them.

67
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,941
Then there are some
better people,

68
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,531
who think that by
ruling others,

69
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:26,651
by getting power,
they can achieve

70
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:31,571
very great position in life,

71
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,191
they too assume, fail.

72
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,191
You have seen what
happens to them,

73
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:41,151
people don't even want
to talk about them.

74
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:46,941
Now there are people
who get attached to someone

75
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:51,441
to one person or to the family, to
their children, to their relations,

76
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,861
very common in India.

77
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:58,901
That's also not the way you
can get to God,

78
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,781
that's also so limited,

79
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:05,821
keeps you hanging
round them

80
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:11,731
and wasting your energy
completely.

81
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:22,781
But if you enter into
your being fully,

82
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:27,361
then all these things have
such meaning;

83
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,281
everything has
a meaning then.

84
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,031
In a sense if you posses
anything,

85
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:38,651
and if you're that kind of a person
who is supposed to keep possessing,

86
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:44,941
he never possesses,
he's so detached.

87
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:49,691
He's never possessive;
he's so detached about it.

88
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:53,281
But, he can play around, because
he's so detached,

89
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:56,611
he can create a drama
out of it.

90
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:01,941
He can play with
the possessions,

91
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:05,111
and teach lots of lessons
to people,

92
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:12,611
HeÂ´s so detached, so generous,
he enjoys his generosity.

93
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:19,031
The whole thing becomes
so different so dynamic.

94
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:22,731
All the beauty that is created
by human beings,

95
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:27,241
as possession is exposed
before you

96
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,571
and you start enjoying
all those things

97
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,991
without possessing them.

98
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:41,241
You understand the myth
of possession.

99
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:48,731
Same with your powers that people
have over other people.

100
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:54,111
Those who try to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga,

101
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:59,071
or want to have a kind
of a privilege over Sahaja Yoga

102
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:03,401
can be subtle, this can
go very far.

103
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:05,741
This subtlety goes to
this extent

104
00:10:05,991 --> 00:10:12,321
that I've seen people try to save
money on account of Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:18,151
That's also the attention
is on money.

106
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,781
To make money or
to save money,

107
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:27,111
to make a business out of
Sahaja Yoga is all absurd,

108
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:30,281
but if you say so I say,
"All right go ahead for a while,

109
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:35,941
try. You'll find that Sahaja Yoga
is no business."

110
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:41,151
Of course Sahaja Yogis
can work together,

111
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,321
can do some business,
but Sahaja Yoga is no business.

112
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,861
Is business of God,

113
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:52,651
where you have to give
everything that you have,

114
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,781
not ot be attached
to anything,

115
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,941
not to be attached.

116
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,401
There's no money
to be paid as such,

117
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:04,191
but all your heart has
to be poured into it.

118
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:07,321
If you cannot pour your
heart into it

119
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:11,731
you cannot achieve.

120
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:14,731
Same about power.

121
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,731
Some people think

122
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:19,281
that they can even overpower
Sahaja Yogis,

123
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:23,861
impress them, control them,

124
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:29,571
such people are thrown out of
Sahaja Yoga completely.

125
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:35,241
You have to enjoy
the power of love,

126
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:39,111
that people see you as
their protector,

127
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:42,731
as their help, as their
support,

128
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:48,401
as their friend,

129
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:53,241
than somebody who is
a dominating personality.

130
00:11:56,491 --> 00:12:03,731
You have to be a father head and
not a demonic destructive force,

131
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,111
which is always threatening
everyone.

132
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:09,941
Such people will be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

133
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,651
You are found out.

134
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,821
I have  no sympathies
with such people, never,

135
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:21,191
that will bring you down,
in no way.

136
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,691
Keep your self aloof
with them,

137
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:30,531
otherwise when they are thrown
away as tangents from Sahaja Yoga

138
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,861
you might get out
with them,

139
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,731
so be careful.

140
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:40,691
Then those people who waste
all their time

141
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,111
just thinking about
their family, this thing,

142
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,781
or those who have never
thought of their family,

143
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,861
also come to Sahaja Yoga.

144
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,031
This is a very subtler
ground

145
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:58,731
on which they can loose
their attention to their Spirit.

146
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:04,731
They spoil their children, they spoil
their husbands, they spoil their wives.

147
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:10,491
The whole attention
goes in a wrong way

148
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,321
and it becomes a very
important issue with them,

149
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:17,491
how the marriages are successful, how
the children are this thing, that thing.

150
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,281
They don't leave it to God.

151
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:22,151
They have to leave it to God.
We are all Saints,

152
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,361
you have to leave every
thing to God.

153
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:29,491
In the beginning in Sahaja Yoga
everybody says,

154
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:33,441
"My husband is like that, my wife is
like that, my brother is like that,

155
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,781
my children are like this.
Mother look after them,"

156
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:38,071
all right in the beginning,
is all right.

157
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:41,731
When you grow you
must get out of it.

158
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:46,991
It's an individual journey towards
God when you meditate,

159
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:50,941
and when you reach there
then you become collective.

160
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:57,071
Before that, it's an absolute
individual journey within,

161
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:59,941
absolutely individual journey.

162
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:04,611
You should be able to
see this.

163
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:10,901
You are in this journey
nobody is your relation

164
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:14,901
nobody is your brother, nobody
is your friend,

165
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:19,241
you're absolutely alone,

166
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,651
absolutely alone.

167
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,241
You have to move alone
within yourself.

168
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,321
Don't hate anyone,
don't be responsible,

169
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:34,361
but in meditative mood
you're alone.

170
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:38,151
No one exists there,
you alone,

171
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:41,901
and once you enter
into that ocean

172
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,111
then the whole world
becomes your family.

173
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:51,861
The whole world is your
own manifestation.

174
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:56,361
All the children become
your children

175
00:14:56,611 --> 00:15:04,401
and you treat all people with
equal understanding.

176
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:15,321
The whole expansion takes place when
you enter inside your Spirit

177
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:21,531
and see starting through
the eyes of the Spirit.

178
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:29,441
Such calm, such peace,
such bliss exists within you.

179
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:36,151
You have to be ready
for that journey.

180
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:48,191
That journey is alone in
your meditativeness

181
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:50,441
and the more you find something
in your meditation

182
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:54,361
the more you want to go
and distribute it to others.

183
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,571
That has to,

184
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:00,191
if that does not come into you
then it has not worked out.

185
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:05,821
There is no purity, there's
some sort of a bias.

186
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:08,991
In that individual pursuit,
what ever you find,

187
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,191
you want to enjoy
it with others,

188
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,861
want to give it to others.

189
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:18,401
This is the sign of a person who
has been really meditating.

190
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,691
The one who is meditative

191
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,611
and has not been able to
distribute  what he has found,

192
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:33,241
is cheating himself and
cheating others as well.

193
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:38,611
Because that joy that you
receive in your meditation

194
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:46,281
has to be distributed, has
to be given, has to be shown.

195
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:49,781
It should flow in your
being

196
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:56,441
as a light radiates from
every illumined lamp.

197
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,731
We don't have to take
a vow

198
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,281
to say this is an enlightened
light,

199
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:02,651
in the same way,

200
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:07,111
a saint should not be certified
that he is a saint.

201
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:12,941
The depth you achieve within
yourself spreads all over,

202
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:16,361
it is such an action
and reaction.

203
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:20,821
The more deeper you become
the radiation is much more.

204
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,861
A simple person, very
ordinary person,

205
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:29,821
uneducated person,
can be like that.

206
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:34,491
We have you know, one
gentleman called Vardic in Bombay

207
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:40,571
he's an old man,
he's so deep, he radiates.

208
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:45,611
People depend on him,
he radiates love,

209
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,151
so meditative.

210
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:51,691
You don't have to spend too
much time on meditation,

211
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:56,941
but what ever you spend time,
what ever you gain

212
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,491
is has to be visible
outside,

213
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:08,111
how you radiate and how
you give it to others.

214
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:12,941
That's the quality of the
saints you have to be.

215
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:17,401
Unless and until you become deeper,
we cannot save other Sahaja Yogis

216
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,191
and we cannot save those
who are not Sahaja Yogis.

217
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:30,571
You have to rise higher and higher
to pull the whole curtain up.

218
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,071
Those who try to rise
higher

219
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,111
pull the whole thing
upward

220
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:44,571
and they give a pull to everyone
who ascend with them.

221
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:49,731
So just try to keep your
aim clear cut.

222
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:52,691
Must understand what is
your aim in life as Sahaja Yogis.

223
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,491
Now you are changed
people.

224
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,111
You are no more people who have
to deal with possessions

225
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:04,241
worry about them, about mundane
things, about your livelihoods.

226
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,491
You are no more people
who have to worry too much

227
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:10,941
about your health and things
or your personal lives.

228
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,991
You are not to worry also
about your jobs so much,

229
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:19,441
that's not important

230
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:24,781
and last of all not to
worry about your family,

231
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,731
children, husband, wife

232
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:33,731
and find a pocket
for you to hide into it.

233
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:37,031
Because the only thing where
you can really hide yourself

234
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:42,441
is the love of God, where
you can really get

235
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:46,941
the great restful, blissful,
feeling

236
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:52,401
of his complete protection.

237
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,941
Sydney has done very well before
and it's progressing better,

238
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,991
but the pace is not
as it should be.

239
00:20:03,191 --> 00:20:05,491
So we have to think of new
ways and methods

240
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:08,151
how we can spread this.

241
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:12,281
But first you must assume
your positions as you are.

242
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:15,491
You must assume that
you are all saints

243
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,941
that you have to
do great work -

244
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,861
not the ego part of it,
but the manifestation of it.

245
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,781
Every one of you has
to decide for oneself.

246
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,731
I'm sure it's going
to work out,

247
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:36,241
and this time My visit is going
to help you a lot by understanding

248
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:43,991
what is the best to spread
this light all.

249
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:48,071
May God bless you.
