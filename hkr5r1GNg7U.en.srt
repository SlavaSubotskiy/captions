1
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:35,886
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:45,396
It was a thing of great joy to Me to come
to Sheffield again.

3
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:53,086
Always this name Sheffield created a kind
of a mystery in My mind.

4
00:07:53,086 --> 00:08:00,306
The word Sheffield could be the ‘She Field’
and She is the Mother energy, the energy within

5
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:08,676
you which creates this field within you and
is in the Gita.

6
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:17,726
Shri Krishna has talked about the field that
we all have a Pradesh - is the field but Desh

7
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:23,606
means the field and the enlightened one is
the Pradesh.

8
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:29,755
And that same thing happens to us when this
Kundalini rises within you.

9
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:38,086
This Holy Ghost which is described in the
bible, She is the Kundalini, She is the Mother.

10
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:45,466
Actually people don’t know anything about
Holy Ghost and we didn’t give Christ much

11
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,116
chance to speak about it.

12
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:51,506
He could only speak for three and a half years,
is nothing.

13
00:08:51,506 --> 00:09:00,866
I can tell you three and a half years in this
land anywhere in the whole world it’s so

14
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:08,376
difficult even to convince four people that
they have to seek the truth, it’s very difficult.

15
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:11,776
Especially in the land where He was born.

16
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:14,826
It was full of ignorance, complete ignorance.

17
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:23,126
And in that ignorance to speak about realization,
to speak about second birth, even to speak

18
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:26,956
about God was so difficult.

19
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:32,237
And He was just crucified for nothing at all,
today we may have big organizations in His

20
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:38,056
name but when He lived nobody listened to
Him and they crucified Him.

21
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:45,576
He talked about Holy Ghost but this Holy Ghost
had been interpreted by people in various

22
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:46,576
ways.

23
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:51,475
They’ve never been able to say what is this
Holy Ghost but logically you can come to some

24
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:57,145
conclusion yourselves because you’re all
intelligent people.

25
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,966
We talk about the Father, all right, and then
the Son.

26
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:05,885
Have you heard of a father producing a son?

27
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:07,656
You have to have the Mother.

28
00:10:07,656 --> 00:10:10,926
It’s the Mother who creates the Son.

29
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:18,056
Now why this Holy Ghost was kept as a secret,
never talked about it because Christ was afraid

30
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:24,035
– not afraid but was cautious I should say,
because such people are never afraid of anything.

31
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:32,406
He was cautious to talk about His Mother because
if they had harmed His Mother by any chance,

32
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:39,885
then He had eleven powers of destruction and
the destruction of world would have come much

33
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,676
earlier than today.

34
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:48,296
He had to play the whole drama of His crucifixion
and that’s how He had to go through all

35
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:49,296
that.

36
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:52,406
In that process He didn’t want to involve
His Mother.

37
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:58,396
He didn’t want to explain about Holy Ghost
and He knew that it will be later on explained.

38
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:02,815
But logically we must understand what is this
Holy Ghost we are talking about?

39
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:03,815
[A dove?]

40
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:04,815
All right, it’s peace.

41
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:07,216
How do you get to the peace?

42
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,216
Supposing it is the symbol of peace.

43
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:19,005
Today we see in the world we see these televisions
and we hear, we read newspapers and we are

44
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:25,376
shattered and so much of friction, so much
of sin.

45
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:30,936
People are not even worried about what they
are doing, to what extent human beings can

46
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:39,326
go you can see the way a three year-old child
was molested, the innocence is attacked like

47
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,326
this.

48
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:41,326
Why?

49
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,076
Why human beings cannot control their desires
which are so devilish?

50
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:47,876
Why there is so much of friction in this world?

51
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:54,716
We have to think about it and we must also
think positively what we can do about it.

52
00:11:54,716 --> 00:12:00,417
Now at the same time there are so many seekers
of truth born on this earth.

53
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,886
This is the special time and that’s why
they are born on this earth.

54
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:10,676
But they are misled, they go to wrong people,
they get identified with wrong people.

55
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:18,906
When I came here, the person who is organizing
Sahaja Yoga here told Me that, “Mother,

56
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,496
they come, they get their realization and
then they disappear, they start doubting.”

57
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:26,456
I said, “That’s a good sign, it’s a
healthy sign.”

58
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:31,826
Let them doubt because the way they jump into
all these horrible things like gurus and this

59
00:12:31,826 --> 00:12:36,686
and that, the way they accept as if they have
no personality, they have no discretion.

60
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:43,496
The way they jump into even drugs I don’t
know, what happens that we have lost all our

61
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,496
personality.

62
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:52,146
They took to any fashion, to any nonsense
so easily and to reality with such difficulty.

63
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:57,906
We have lost our discretion that’s what
it is, but doesn’t matter whatever it is

64
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,556
use your brains.

65
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:03,716
Understand that this world is not created
to be destroyed.

66
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:09,656
You’re not created out of amoeba just to
be destroyed by something nonsensical like

67
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:15,326
drug(s) or some sort of a guru; nobody has
right to destroy you.

68
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:21,556
They cannot create you and they cannot destroy
you, nor you have any right to destroy yourself

69
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:28,206
because you cannot create yourself, the one
who is your Creator, the one who has loved

70
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:38,466
you who has so beautifully made this beautiful
human life is responsible.

71
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:43,996
He is the one who is so earnest about it that
you should get your realization, that you

72
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:50,026
should get your second birth, that you should
be baptized in the real sense of the word.

73
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:59,416
I agree religions have shown funny things,
some thing so absurd that one can start doubting

74
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,506
their credibility.

75
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:07,116
I admit that, but that is the mistake of human
beings not of the divine.

76
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:13,656
Divine created beautiful flowers on the same
tree of life time and time again but when

77
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:18,396
the people plucked these flowers and said,
“These are mine, these are mine.”

78
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:26,116
They became dead and ugly and they are fighting
now in the name of God, in the name of religion.

79
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:36,776
Imagine, how can you do such merciless, horrible,
brutal things to other human beings but this

80
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:41,486
must shatter you, this must make you understand
and you should be aware.

81
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:48,026
Get out of your sleep now and know that you
are the people who are seekers.

82
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:53,626
You have to be more aware, more understanding
of your responsibility.

83
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:58,196
It is no use standing there with a banner
saying we want peace.

84
00:14:58,196 --> 00:14:59,196
How?

85
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,966
The peace has to be within.

86
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,236
Human beings are not at peace.

87
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:09,456
You see in the art you see today the art has
left the Divine behind, the art has become

88
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:13,856
so, chaotic.

89
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:19,486
The expression of esthetics are just missing
there’s no beauty in it.

90
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:26,906
You feel the chaotic heart of an artist being
expressed in that what he’s made, why?

91
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,056
Because he has lost himself.

92
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:36,736
Now it is the responsibility of you people
living in these modern times to become that,

93
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:44,526
that source of peace, which is your Spirit,
and the Spirit resides within you.

94
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:51,056
It is all the time there it is the witness
of this field I should say the She Field,

95
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:57,206
the field that is to be enlightened by this
Kundalini that exists within you but is not

96
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,046
enlightened, it has not come into your attention.

97
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:05,565
The Spirit has not come into your attention,
that’s why we think this is all talk.

98
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:11,765
There are people who are so called intellectuals;
they say this is all talk, talk, talk.

99
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:21,516
For a mental conception it is impossible to
tell what lies beyond it because mind is a

100
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:22,516
limited thing.

101
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,796
You have to go beyond mind; you have to be
triggered into the space to see that.

102
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:33,165
The evolution has been just like your spacecraft
going into the space.

103
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:41,446
First, the first thing comes up is the physical
being, explodes gets its accelerations then

104
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:47,756
becomes your mental being, your emotional
being, your spiritual being and then it has

105
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,375
to go to the space.

106
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,846
That is the time today is the space age.

107
00:16:53,846 --> 00:17:00,516
When we talk of the space age you think of
the space, which is beyond this gravity, there

108
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:07,745
is some space, which is beyond all gravities,
beyond all temptations, beyond all slaveries.

109
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:11,946
We talk of our freedom, where is the freedom
I just don’t think see.

110
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,725
Anybody comes now and says all right, have
this drug for so much money.

111
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:17,966
We are finished with it.

112
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:22,526
Anybody comes and says all right, you take
up your clothes this way, live like this,

113
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:27,946
we just accept without thinking, without understanding.

114
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:33,086
We have given up the traditions alright whatever
was wrong in the tradition should have been

115
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:38,966
given no doubt but everything if you give
up then remember we are falling down.

116
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,985
We are coming down we are not going up.

117
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:45,375
When you are going up you do not give up the
staircase.

118
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:49,595
Staircase is there and you go up higher and
higher.

119
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:57,245
No tradition is so bad is to be discarded
but if it is so it should be discarded but

120
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:03,735
that is what is the discretion and that discretion
is so much lacking today that people can’t

121
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:12,146
see that what we are doing collectively or
individually is not constructive.

122
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:18,946
Now I would say that this is not the time
for us just to sit back on the fence and see

123
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:21,235
which side we fall.

124
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:25,346
Either you will fall into hell or you’ll
go to heaven.

125
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:31,065
This is the situation, we are so precariously
placed, I do not want to frighten you because

126
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:37,555
there is the Spirit within you just to be
enlightened, it’s your own, it is there,

127
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:39,846
it’s your own property.

128
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:45,446
It’s not Mine, it’s yours, it’s your
own treasure within you.

129
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:48,416
Only this treasure is to be exposed to you.

130
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,735
Now for that how can you pay?

131
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,716
First thing you must know you cannot pay for
it.

132
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:58,055
If I say that then all the gurus are after
My life, they want to kill Me, they want to

133
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,526
do all those things.

134
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:02,726
You cannot take money for God’s work.

135
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,656
We sold Christ, you know that.

136
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:08,526
He didn’t take any money, did He?

137
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:13,556
We have got such a great personality like
Christ and we just want to discard Him, make

138
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:18,286
fun of Him, say all kinds of things about
Him, intellectualize Him, organize Him.

139
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:19,815
You cannot touch Him.

140
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:25,045
You’re still human beings, you have to be
the Spirit to understand that Great Soul which

141
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:26,055
came on this earth.

142
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:31,326
In the same way any other soul, which was
an Incarnation who came on this earth, cannot

143
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:40,666
be understood by our normal understanding,
but only a person with that pure intelligence

144
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:46,446
can see this point that I’m not satisfied
with what I am, I have to go beyond.

145
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:52,345
There’s some transformation needed and how
will this transformation take place?

146
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:58,526
We can’t do anything about it because we
have done nothing to become human beings did

147
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:00,176
we?

148
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,776
What did we do to become human beings?

149
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:09,446
Nothing, so going beyond also must be built
in within us.

150
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:15,966
The way we became human beings there must
be some built-in process by which we will

151
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,576
become that higher being.

152
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:24,326
Now the problem at the human level is that
somebody has to talk at human level.

153
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:31,805
Say at the fish level, one fish had to come
up so the others could follow that fish.

154
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:37,055
At human level, some human being has to tell
you about it.

155
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,185
That’s how Christ came on this earth.

156
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:46,805
I mean we have a quite a long traditional
history of all these great people came on

157
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,896
this earth at different places, at different
times.

158
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:54,526
According to the time they had to talk.

159
00:20:54,526 --> 00:21:01,896
When they talked say, about the flowers, say
they talked that they are Gods, like Socrates

160
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:05,886
talked about Gods, like Confucius talked about
Gods.

161
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:09,795
When they talked we have to please our gods
we started doubting.

162
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:12,336
What god’s he’s talking about?

163
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:16,915
Whatever they saw we could not see, all right.

164
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:19,386
Then they thought no use talking about gods.

165
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:25,006
If you talk about gods then it becomes a sort
of a worship of something that is a flower.

166
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:29,586
We talk about flowers then we think we have
become God and we talk about flower all the

167
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:30,896
time.

168
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:33,836
But we have to get to the honey.

169
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,076
How do we do it?

170
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:41,815
So they said, “All right, don’t talk about
God, talk about abstract, talk about the fragrance,

171
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,185
talk about the honey itself.”

172
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:49,036
But how do you become, how do you get to the
honey?

173
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:54,215
By talking about it again it became a talk
and talk and talk.

174
00:21:54,215 --> 00:22:03,155
So how it has to happen that you have to become
the bee, the transformation has to take place.

175
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:09,415
First understand this simple point that some
transformation has to take place within us

176
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:20,155
to go or to penetrate into that unknown divine
which we call as collective unconscious.

177
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:24,926
Something has to happen to us that we have
to become subtler beings.

178
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:31,845
Don’t be satisfied and don’t self certify
yourself that “I’m all right; nothing

179
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:32,975
wrong with me.”

180
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,815
No, nothing’s wrong with you.

181
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:38,846
Y0ou’re all right, but you have still to
be connected to the mains.

182
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:44,055
Like this instrument, if it is not connected
to the mains it won’t work.

183
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:50,565
It is as simple as this instrument that you
are to be connected with the mains and for

184
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:55,776
that you have got built-in process that has
to work out.

185
00:22:55,776 --> 00:23:01,826
It’s nice we have instruments in these modern
times that I can use them as an analogies

186
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,225
to explain to you.

187
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:10,466
For others they had to use the analogies of
the seed that how we imbed the seed in the

188
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:16,685
Mother Earth and the Mother Earth has the
capacity to sprout the seed and the seed has

189
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:21,305
the built-in map of all the trees it is going
to create.

190
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:26,495
Now if you look at the seed do you see the
miracle behind the little seed there?

191
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:30,985
In India we have huge big banyan trees and
if you see the seed is so small that it’s

192
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:36,396
quite microscopic and it makes huge big banyan
trees.

193
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:37,475
How does it make?

194
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:38,696
We never wonder.

195
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:44,175
Whatever is the wonder, the mystery of this
creation we never wonder about it, we never

196
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:47,475
look at it, look at ourselves, what are we?

197
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:51,095
We are human beings, these eyes, can we make
eyes like this.

198
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:55,826
We are making computers, but look at this
brain the computer that is within, we don’t

199
00:23:55,826 --> 00:23:57,915
have to program it nothing it just knows.

200
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:03,076
You know I’m sitting here, I know you’re
sitting here just looking at it.

201
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:09,875
You don’t have to go through the process
of finding out what is the process of it and

202
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,766
then it moves the whole thing and gives you
the program and out of the program something

203
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,096
comes out.

204
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:20,896
It is there just at the same instant you know
what is it.

205
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:24,886
This kind of a computer is made for us, why?

206
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:32,896
To be wasted, to be confused, to be ended
up in a lunatic asylum?

207
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:37,605
We must have the proper value system about
ourselves.

208
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:43,975
First of all we are human beings made from
amoeba to this stage in thousands of years

209
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:49,916
with great care and delicacy, for what purpose
we must ask the question, why are we made?

210
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:55,865
Are we made here just to ruin ourselves or
not to do anything just like blind people

211
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:58,965
going about hitting here hitting there.

212
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:07,236
No, we are made to become the Spirit and the
whole system is built-in within you.

213
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:13,095
And we have to go into another realm of our
awareness into a new dimension.

214
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,526
Now these dimensions can be also misinterpreted.

215
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:23,685
It’s such a dangerous line we are into because
these modern times are full of horrible people.

216
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:29,476
Like somebody says that “All right, I can
hear voices."

217
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:30,476
So what?

218
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:31,866
"I can see light."

219
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,616
So what?

220
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:40,685
Or somebody says that, "All right, I feel
like I’m flying in the air, I leave my body."

221
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,685
So what?

222
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:44,366
What have you got?

223
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:49,845
You are under the control of something else,
you don’t know anything.

224
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:54,476
Logically you must know what you are doing,
what’s happening to you, what is within

225
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,026
you, you must know each and everything.

226
00:25:57,026 --> 00:26:04,835
You have to know that if I have become the
light then I must have the power of the light,

227
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,216
I don’t see the light.

228
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:09,656
If I see the light I’m not the light.

229
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:15,126
If I become the light, then I have the power
of light.

230
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:22,906
In the light you see clearly and that is what
you get is collective consciousness.

231
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:29,726
You can feel another person’s Chakras, you
can feel your centers and if you know how

232
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:35,326
to cure that, how to improve that and how
to raise the Kundalini which is a very, very

233
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:41,416
simple thing - because it is so fundamental
that’s why it is so simple.

234
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:51,386
You can cure yourself, you can cure others
and you can live very joyously within yourself.

235
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:58,886
This is what you have to have and that’s
how you will realize that we are part and

236
00:26:58,886 --> 00:27:01,926
parcel of the whole.

237
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:05,955
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm.

238
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:13,256
Not by talking about it by saying about it
by mental projections no, it happens to you,

239
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:24,815
it really happens to you when you become the
spirit, it works on your central nervous system,

240
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:30,065
you know what you are and what others are.

241
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:39,146
That they’re part and parcel of you is known
to you on your central nervous system.

242
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:45,075
So we come to conclusion that if we have to
become the Spirit what should we do?

243
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,075
Nothing.

244
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:50,746
What do we do when we put the seed in the
Mother Earth?

245
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:56,676
Nothing, but once you become that then you
have to look after it.

246
00:27:56,676 --> 00:28:02,896
When the seed is sprouted, comes out of the
Mother Earth then we have to look after it,

247
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:08,276
and that’s the point where most of the western
people fail.

248
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:14,276
The reason is this knowledge is not known
to them.

249
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:19,016
Their knowledge is like the tree, which is
exposed outside.

250
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,085
They don’t have the knowledge of the roots.

251
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:26,486
This is the knowledge of the roots and we
have to give and take.

252
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:33,276
We have to talk about it; we have to understand
that there’s nothing like India and England

253
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,636
two different things.

254
00:28:35,636 --> 00:28:44,266
England I call it the heart of the universe,
it is, and India is the Kundalini of the universe.

255
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:51,976
The Kundalini has to know England and England
has to know the Kundalini.

256
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:59,845
If it is one whole body then one part has
to know another part.

257
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:12,426
So all your misconceptions, or conceptions,
or maybe right ideas are all become absolutely

258
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:19,705
evident, vividly seen because you get the
light of your own Spirit.

259
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:21,136
That Spirit is missing.

260
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:27,705
That Spirit which is all the time watching
you, witnessing you has to be enlightened

261
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:32,976
in the sense that the Spirit must enlighten
your attention.

262
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:39,835
That’s how you become the attention and
wherever you put the attention you act.

263
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:47,206
It’s very surprising, like if you’re watching
the television, watching the television, it’s

264
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:51,106
unreal and you’re looking at the television.

265
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:56,965
They cannot act on you and you cannot act
on them because it is artificial.

266
00:29:56,965 --> 00:29:59,886
But supposing there’s a gentleman sitting.

267
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:05,766
He’s a living body not artificial you are
talking to that person and that person is

268
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:07,815
talking to you it acts.

269
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:13,726
But this attention which is a subtler being
within you - your attention - supposing you

270
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:20,356
project it to someone and it acts for the
benevolence, never for destruction but for

271
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:21,396
the benevolence.

272
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:27,085
When it acts for the benevolence you are amazed,
how does it happen?

273
00:30:27,085 --> 00:30:31,796
How can my attention have the power of benevolence?

274
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:37,316
Because in your attention is now the light
of the Spirit.

275
00:30:37,316 --> 00:30:40,835
So you become benevolent.

276
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:47,986
You know the truth whether it is true or not.

277
00:30:47,986 --> 00:30:49,496
How will you know?

278
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:56,126
I was once in Pune and you see in England
they say I’m preaching, I’m preaching

279
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:59,146
about Hinduism, I’m converting everybody
to Hindus.

280
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:04,335
And in India they say I’m converting them
to Christianity - because I’m doing both

281
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:09,166
you see, [laughter from Shri Mataji and from
the audience] So they have a great objection

282
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:14,455
about Me everywhere because they don’t see
the integrated work about Sahaja Yoga, all

283
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,455
right?

284
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:22,407
So they said that “This is wrong, whatever
She’s saying is not correct because we are

285
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:26,685
Brahmins and we know about our shastras and
we are Brahmins.”

286
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,286
But they didn’t tell Me all this.

287
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:33,075
They talked all these things to others and
they said, “We can’t have Her in our hall,

288
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:38,185
She’s not a Brahmin and She’s in a Christian
family we can’t have Her.”

289
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:43,195
So the Brahmins, as usual all priests as they’re
always against the truth you see they were

290
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,606
against the truth there also as Brahmins.

291
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:51,526
I didn’t know all these things but suddenly
I felt and I said, "Whosoever are Brahmins

292
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:53,546
among you please come forward."

293
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:58,396
So four five you see very hefty people came
and sat in front like this.

294
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,356
I said," Really are you Brahmins?"

295
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:01,356
“Yes” they said.

296
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,295
“All right, all put your hands towards Me,
like this.”

297
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:09,085
They put their hands like this towards Me
and what happened that they start shaking

298
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:10,085
like this.

299
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,085
I said, “What’s happening?

300
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:12,146
Stop it, why are shaking?

301
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:14,796
He said to the others who are there they are
also shaking.

302
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:17,906
I said yes but ask them from where they come.

303
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:23,575
They said we are certified lunatics coming
from a lunatic asylum [audience laughs] because

304
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:28,646
Mother has cured some lunatics so we are sitting
here.

305
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:32,816
Then they realized that they were also quite
lunatic [audience laughs again] because they’re

306
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:33,816
fundamentalists.

307
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:39,786
If you go to extremes you become lunatic,
I mean lunatics at least can be put in the

308
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:44,146
lunatic asylum but these people are going
around everywhere, you don’t know how to

309
00:32:44,146 --> 00:32:49,906
control them, all over the world they are
creating such problems every, every country

310
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:50,906
has them.

311
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:55,506
Somewhere they are very sophisticated so you
can’t make them out somewhere they are very

312
00:32:55,506 --> 00:33:00,045
closed so you know they are there but some
are can be very subtle you can’t make them

313
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:05,026
out but you cannot make them budge from whatever
they are holding onto.

314
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:10,996
So this is how relatively first you realize
what is the Truth.

315
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:17,705
With these vibrations, with the vibrations
that flow that you feel when the Kundalini

316
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:24,136
crosses through your Brahmarandra as they
call it, we can call the fontanel bone area

317
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:29,565
you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost coming out of your head.

318
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:35,856
Then also you start feeling sometimes little
late in your fingers the cool breeze coming

319
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:36,856
in.

320
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:40,396
Now some people are very proud, "Oh, I’m
not feeling anything."

321
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:45,116
That’s not a good thing; if you’re not
feeling there’s something wrong.

322
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,226
Somewhere something missing, normally you
should.

323
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:54,715
Children feel it very fast because they’re
so innocent, not yet spoiled by anything.

324
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:59,536
They are not so egoistical; they do not have
these barriers.

325
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:02,895
Some sort of problem is there that you’re
not feeling the cool breeze.

326
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:08,476
You should because this is the All Pervading
Power of God which surrounds us, is everywhere

327
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:12,306
and every one of you should feel that cool
breeze.

328
00:34:12,306 --> 00:34:19,066
Once you start feeling the cool breeze then
you become the joy because first of course

329
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:20,246
you want to try with everything.

330
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:21,276
"Is it cool breeze?

331
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,305
Is it cool breeze?

332
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:23,706
That is cool breeze.

333
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,786
Should I go or not?

334
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:28,026
Let me see now, if it is cool breeze I’ll
go otherwise."

335
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,906
You go on like that.

336
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:42,546
Then you realize this is the truth, this is
the truth, and then the joy of finding the

337
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:43,546
truth emerges.

338
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:47,046
But in India it’s just the other way round.

339
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:49,636
They’re not bothered because they know what
happens.

340
00:34:49,636 --> 00:34:53,976
They know; they have the knowledge of the
roots, so they know what is to be found out.

341
00:34:53,976 --> 00:35:00,435
We don’t have to go very far, even, so near,
I mean, few years back we should say was,

342
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:03,866
we had Nanaka, we had Kabira.

343
00:35:03,866 --> 00:35:10,856
They talked about it very clearly they told
about this so vividly that anybody with any

344
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,805
sense should understand.

345
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:21,425
Especially Kabira who was such a great poet
and such a great incarnation, I would say

346
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:31,065
the way he talked right from all these Brahmins
to all the hypocrites and everything he gave

347
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:34,556
them left and right.

348
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:38,626
He was like Saint Michael with a sword in
his hand cutting everybody.

349
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:43,425
Like your William Blake, he was really like
your William Blake who gave left and right

350
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:45,825
to all these nonsensical people.

351
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:50,526
He has talked about it, he very clearly describing
Sahaj.

352
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:55,736
He said, Nanaka has said (???) you can only
get Samadhi through Sahaja.

353
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,955
Sahaja means spontaneous, only spontaneously
can you get it.

354
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:07,065
Then you have got Kabira who was treated like
a (shidule?) caste.

355
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:10,465
Like a (shidule?) caste he was treated.

356
00:36:10,465 --> 00:36:12,165
Nobody respected him.

357
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:17,945
Then we had Ramdas another one a great man
I’m told, there is a temple of this Ramdas.

358
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:22,626
I was so amazed that in England it should
come and prosper.

359
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:28,195
They were treated just like (shidule?) caste
by these people nobody would listen to them.

360
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:33,386
Nobody would allow them to come in a temple,
these great saints, because they were not

361
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:40,546
be a born in a Brahmin family; and these great
people have talked, Nanaka has talked very

362
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:44,876
clearly, very recently they have talked about
these things.

363
00:36:44,876 --> 00:36:47,516
Hundred years back only.

364
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,926
William Blake has talked about Sahaja Yoga.

365
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:57,315
He has said, "The men of God, men of God"
- that’s you - "will become prophets and

366
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:01,036
they will have powers to make others prophet."

367
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:07,146
He had such hopes of making England into Jerusalem,
but where are those English?

368
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,486
I have still to meet many.

369
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:12,705
I’ve worked in this country for twelve years,
relentlessly.

370
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:21,136
India I’ve worked very little but we have
thousand fold people who have got realization

371
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:22,936
in India.

372
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:29,866
They may be poor but they know what they have
to get, to them to get to their self realization

373
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:32,075
is the thing.

374
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:37,935
Nothing else matters, they do not intellectualize,
they know already this is it, this is it.

375
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:47,156
Everyone knows, right from President downward
everyone knows what to expect, but whatever

376
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:53,935
is our knowledge has been, we have to know
that this outside knowledge whatever we have

377
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:57,356
has to have roots and we have to go to our
roots.

378
00:37:57,356 --> 00:38:01,666
We cannot live with this outside knowledge,
we have to know ourselves.

379
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:05,445
Everybody is talking about self-knowledge.

380
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:13,056
There have been so many books, so many things,
I mean so much of seeking is on, that we cannot

381
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:20,616
just avoid getting to our spirit, we have
to get to it but the only problem where I

382
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:26,915
stumble down is that people do not have (?). They’re
very frivolously treating the whole thing,

383
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:32,785
those who have got realization for them the
Kingdom of God is awaiting.

384
00:38:32,785 --> 00:38:38,856
They are not only welcome but they’ll be
cherished and that’s what has to be done.

385
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:44,805
You have to cherish your Spirit, your Self
- you’ve not done it.

386
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:50,126
Only just getting realization, feeling satisfied
about it itself is not sufficient.

387
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:52,586
“Now I’m realized, all right, I’ve got
the cool breeze, I’m this.”

388
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:53,825
No, you have to grow.

389
00:38:53,825 --> 00:39:00,666
It’s still a sapling that has to grow, for
that you don’t have to pay anything, nothing.

390
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:06,805
Here these people, really I tell you, they
are working so hard because they have achieved

391
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,945
a certain height in Sahaja Yoga.

392
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,266
They don’t take any money.

393
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:16,686
They were just like you, they had to work
hard to first establish themselves, because

394
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:21,705
that is the time where people want to say,
"No, Mother said Sahaj, so all right, we’ll

395
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,095
sit at home."

396
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:28,925
That is only for sprouting I said Sahaj, but
we have to look after because we have had

397
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:35,496
conditionings, we have had problems, we have
had physical problems, we have had social

398
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:39,496
problems, we have had psychological problems.

399
00:39:39,496 --> 00:39:46,585
They are to be attended to and the Kundalini
just goes and raise this energy there.

400
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:54,665
Unless and until you know how to maneuver
it or work it out, it is very difficult for

401
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:58,026
this Kundalini to manage by Herself.

402
00:39:58,026 --> 00:40:00,585
You have to show the will.

403
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:03,325
If you do not have the will nobody can force
on you.

404
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:05,516
The Divine is not going to fall at your feet.

405
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:07,665
"All right, all right, get your realization."

406
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:13,286
You have to knock at the door, and these doors
are only six - not many.

407
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:19,516
Six doors which are partly opened out, again
closing, again opening out.

408
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:25,565
You have to just know how to knock and how
to keep them open, finished.

409
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:29,715
Then you become the light, and once you become
the light you give light to others.

410
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,325
That’s how this world is going to be saved.

411
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:36,335
No other way out, no other way out.

412
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:39,715
We have to have transformation; we have to
become the Spirit.

413
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:52,246
We have to be enlightened and to be the light
in the Great Being that is our Creator, our

414
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:58,156
Preserver and the One who is our existence
itself.

415
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:02,636
All these things are so simple.

416
00:41:02,636 --> 00:41:12,106
They may look bombastic when we see from outside,
but when you come inside it’s so simple,

417
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:13,126
it’s very easy.

418
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:17,616
Sahaj also has another meaning that’s “very
easy” - apart from it is spontaneous, it

419
00:41:17,616 --> 00:41:18,756
is very easy.

420
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:21,055
We don’t want to do something easy.

421
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:25,486
Like if we can eat our food like this we’ll
not, we’ll have to take our hand like this,

422
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:29,506
and if you can eat in a difficult way then
it’s very good.

423
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:30,876
That’s human nature.

424
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:32,465
They want to do something like that.

425
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:37,465
Like some people suggested to Me, "Mother
when You go to India and settle down there,

426
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:41,405
then we’ll make these people that, ‘If
you have to get realization, you have to go

427
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:42,405
to Mother.

428
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:47,336
Then you must stay on a mountaintop where
there will be freezing cold.’

429
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:51,756
Let them climb up seven miles and then they
will come to You and they’ll get their realization.

430
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:57,066
Otherwise they will not because their ego
will not be satisfied with given things."

431
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,365
What about Me?

432
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:01,336
I don’t want to trouble you, why should
you?

433
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:04,876
I’ve taken all the troubles; Christ has
taken all the troubles for you.

434
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:10,395
Everybody has taken troubles, you better enjoy
now.

435
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:15,165
You have to enjoy it; just you have to get
it.

436
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,276
There’s no end to My lectures.

437
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:25,916
I’ve been lecturing and lecturing and lecturing
and I would say that this subject is so interesting

438
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:30,776
that all here there are at least 60 percent
people who must have heard thousands of My

439
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:31,776
lectures.

440
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:35,176
Still they would like to hear more and more
[Shri Mataji laughs as She speaks] so I would

441
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:40,696
suggest that we finish at this point, but
know that once you become the knowledge it’s

442
00:42:40,696 --> 00:42:43,576
easier to understand what we are saying.

443
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:48,056
It’s very simple but only thing you have
to become the Spirit.

444
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:50,566
May God Bless You.

445
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:55,556
Now I would like to have some questions but
I’ve seen people when they ask questions

446
00:42:55,556 --> 00:43:00,246
they are representatives of some horrid gurus.

447
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:04,395
Their horrid gurus pay them some money because
they take a lot of money then they pay them

448
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:05,395
some money.

449
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:07,666
Then they come here as identified with these
gurus.

450
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,966
I have to request them what have you got out
of that guru?

451
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,576
Why are you so much enamored by him?

452
00:43:13,576 --> 00:43:18,666
Why are you so much charmed by that, what
have you got?

453
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:23,946
He’s using you.

454
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:30,946
So please when you ask questions ask independently,
freely, I’ll be very happy to answer you

455
00:43:30,946 --> 00:43:36,426
but I don’t like that you are talking because
somebody has told you something.

456
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:53,776
Whatever you know you ask me I’ll be very
happy to answer those questions to you.

457
00:43:53,776 --> 00:44:19,696
May God bless you.

458
00:44:19,696 --> 00:44:30,056
Question: You mentioned Christ, you mentioned
the Holy Ghost, you mentioned the Kundalini.

459
00:44:30,056 --> 00:44:35,076
If Christ is the Son, what is the Kundalini?

460
00:44:35,076 --> 00:44:37,796
Shri Mataji: She is the Mother.

461
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:45,746
Christ within us is the Spirit and Kundalini
is the Holy Ghost, which is the Mother.

462
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:55,095
The reflection of Holy Ghost within us is
the Kundalini and the reflection of Christ

463
00:44:55,095 --> 00:45:09,625
within us is the spirit.

464
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,635
But everybody has played the role.

465
00:45:12,635 --> 00:45:24,126
Like Moses, like Abraham, like Socrates, like
Lao Tze, everybody has played the role to

466
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:27,876
build up this drama they are all part and
parcel of one being.

467
00:45:27,876 --> 00:45:29,536
This one you must understand.

468
00:45:29,536 --> 00:45:34,716
When they said there is one God, he’s not
like rock of Gibraltar.

469
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:42,026
Even rock of Gibraltar has got different molecules
you see but to ask God is one means, I don’t

470
00:45:42,026 --> 00:45:45,576
know, I can not think of such thing just a
one block.

471
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:56,176
He’s not, He has many aspects and these
aspects are expressed in these different ways.

472
00:45:56,176 --> 00:46:06,776
Of course He’s one, united, integrated,
one; but all these aspects are there, and

473
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:13,625
this one God is either in the pockets of the
priests or the pockets of the Brahmins or

474
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:20,626
the pockets of the mullahs or the pockets
of someone.

475
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:30,336
One God.

476
00:46:30,336 --> 00:46:44,026
Question: Does the Kundalini have any relationship
to the Virgin Mary, the physical Mother of

477
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:45,026
Jesus?

478
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:46,026
Shri Mataji: It is, very much so.

479
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:48,046
Yes you asked the same question.

480
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:58,947
She is the Virgin the (kanya?) but gradually
when you come to Sahaja Yoga you will know

481
00:46:58,947 --> 00:47:06,066
the Virgin Mary, what is Her exposure is,
how many times She was born even in India,

482
00:47:06,066 --> 00:47:14,776
what is Her relationship and how great She
is.

483
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:19,086
But why Martin Luther did not talk about Virgin
Mary?

484
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,996
I asked My father who was a realized soul
and he gave a good explanation.

485
00:47:22,996 --> 00:47:28,566
He said it was (?) it means according to the
circumstances at the time, that time suddenly

486
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:38,516
he found that he has to take the people in
a more enlightened field and he is doing so

487
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:44,096
he wanted Muslims also to be included, and
if you suddenly talk about the Mother, they

488
00:47:44,096 --> 00:47:45,625
may not accept.

489
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:57,096
So for that he avoided, but actually he knew
that one day somebody will explain.

490
00:47:57,096 --> 00:48:04,236
But human nature is such I must say that if
you accept one flower, you’ll not accept

491
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:10,625
another, and when they’re dead - not when
they’re living, never, never.

492
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:14,316
When they’re living we’ll never accept
it, we’ll never listen to them.

493
00:48:14,316 --> 00:48:21,306
But once they’re dead then wonderful because
he’s in our pocket, do what you like, it’s

494
00:48:21,306 --> 00:48:22,846
very common.

495
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:29,856
We had one Gyaneshwara, a great saint in India,
very great saint and they have built huge

496
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:34,266
big temple for him and he is in a statue.

497
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,736
So when we went there they said, "You cannot
do meditation here."

498
00:48:37,736 --> 00:48:38,736
I said, "Why?

499
00:48:38,736 --> 00:48:39,916
What did he do?

500
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:40,916
He did meditation."

501
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:44,456
He said, "No, you have to do that kind of
a dance they do called (?)"

502
00:48:44,456 --> 00:48:47,306
I said, "But he did not do it.'

503
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:49,286
He said, "So what?

504
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,856
We do this way.

505
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:53,146
He was another; he was great.

506
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,736
We are not so we have to do this"

507
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:59,616
So I didn’t know how to argue at with that,
so I said, "Look at the statue.

508
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:04,976
Now you are in a statue, better come in a
form to tell all these people.”

509
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:08,936
But when he came in form he didn’t even
have shoes to wear.

510
00:49:08,936 --> 00:49:12,296
He burnt his feet on charred grounds.

511
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:15,216
Nobody gave him water to drink.

512
00:49:15,216 --> 00:49:16,216
All the saints suffered.

513
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:17,216
Any other question please?

514
00:49:17,216 --> 00:49:18,216
Yes.

515
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:24,345
Question: Do you need to believe in God to
get realization, like Buddha didn’t believe

516
00:49:24,345 --> 00:49:29,676
in God but still got realization.

517
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:36,857
Shri Mataji: All right, Buddha did not believe
that’s not the point - He did believe but

518
00:49:36,857 --> 00:49:38,316
He didn’t say about God.

519
00:49:38,316 --> 00:50:03,966
I also didn’t say in the beginning about
God, because if you start talking about God

520
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:05,566
it creates problems.

521
00:50:05,566 --> 00:50:10,946
That he said all these things because, why,
that’s what I’m trying to tell you.

522
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:14,865
You see it is (?) the time, that time.

523
00:50:14,865 --> 00:50:22,286
What he thought that the people in India especially
were worshipping a God in a temple, the Brahmins,

524
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,326
this, that.

525
00:50:23,326 --> 00:50:27,846
The Brahmins thought this is a God; they had
pocketed all the money and all those things.

526
00:50:27,846 --> 00:50:29,996
So how to bring them out of it?

527
00:50:29,996 --> 00:50:34,076
He said, “Don’t talk of God; don’t talk
of anything.

528
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:35,206
Talk of the Self.

529
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:36,786
First step is Self.”

530
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:41,786
He said, “First they will have the Self,
then they will know where is the God.”

531
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:47,256
Of course in the temple also we have some
things, which we can say are swayambus, which

532
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:50,326
are, come out of Mother Earth.

533
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:57,176
It is said in one of the commandments that
whatever is created by Mother Earth or by

534
00:50:57,176 --> 00:51:03,066
the heavens should not be reproduced, but
there is something created.

535
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:13,946
So these temples were all completely monopolized
by Brahmins and these Brahmins tried to rule

536
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:17,276
the whole country, that’s the thing happened.

537
00:51:17,276 --> 00:51:23,626
So Buddha thought, how to get these people
out and He talked about the Self only and

538
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:24,626
nothing else.

539
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,835
He said, “First Self”, and I also felt
the same way in the beginning.

540
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,926
but now the time is different.

541
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:37,416
Now I would say that it can go to any extent
this stupidity of these fundamentalists.

542
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:45,066
Like in Nasik when Mahatma Gandhi returned
from England they said, “You have to go

543
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:50,506
for (? Chitta)” - means a repentance – “You
have to go in for repentance because you put

544
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:53,166
your foot on a foreign land.”

545
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,166
Imagine!

546
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,466
And they would not allow him to exist.

547
00:51:56,466 --> 00:52:00,716
They would not allow him to exist and he had
to do it.

548
00:52:00,716 --> 00:52:05,986
He said, “Now get rid of these mad people.”

549
00:52:05,986 --> 00:52:13,486
He had to do it and it was a Brahmin who killed
him ultimately.

550
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:21,166
So I mean, it’s a very funny world, you
know and in that world we come and we tell

551
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:30,086
about something that is truth - which is truth,
which is good, which is benevolent, which

552
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:35,656
is the thing, but people just kill.

553
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:39,566
I mean there is no need - at least if you
don’t want to hear, all right.

554
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:43,076
Don’t kill them, but they kill.

555
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:50,366
Even Mohammed Sahib was given poison, even
Buddha was tortured by the people, very much

556
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:58,256
tortured in the beginning and His disciples
also went to extremes later on, not his own

557
00:52:58,256 --> 00:53:00,316
disciples but his followers.

558
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:07,655
So now we have people who beat the seekers
on their back.

559
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:11,296
We had one gentleman, his name was, he called
himself Omkar.

560
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:19,556
He came from some Llama and he had a broken
spine and I had to work for days together

561
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:22,885
to put his spine right, and they used a stick
to hit him.

562
00:53:22,885 --> 00:53:24,335
Can you imagine?

563
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:26,546
Is it God?

564
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:32,855
Is it religion?

565
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:41,716
So Buddha and Mahavira, these two persons,
at that time did not talk of God, both of

566
00:53:41,716 --> 00:53:42,716
them.

567
00:53:42,716 --> 00:54:26,916
Later on they again incarnated and talked
of God as Hassan and Hussein, as Kabira.

568
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:52,456
And the illusion was that every time He turned
His feet the carpet turned with Him.

569
00:54:52,456 --> 00:55:01,536
They’re all one; we are only fighting because
we don’t see the oneness.

570
00:55:01,536 --> 00:55:07,966
So because of the time they did speak but
they did not cut out, they had to say, “Stop

571
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:10,946
at this point”, not more because that was
the situation.

572
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:11,946
You can see that.

573
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:12,946
All right?

574
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:13,946
So it’s logical.

575
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:19,375
Question: Do you have to do any practices
to raise the force?

576
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:31,006
Shri Mataji: No, first of all I’d better
do it in a different way that you all get

577
00:55:31,006 --> 00:55:33,595
your realization, first of all.

578
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:39,186
Then of course, as I said, your Kundalini
attends to your problems.

579
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:45,496
She goes down, so then I have to tell you
how to raise it, how to bring it back, how

580
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:46,516
to correct yourself.

581
00:55:46,516 --> 00:55:50,366
Once you’re established, you can do it to
others.

582
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:53,356
So we can say it is in three parts.

583
00:55:53,356 --> 00:55:57,986
First is your establishment, like we can say
the sprouting of the seed.

584
00:55:57,986 --> 00:56:01,256
So that’s the awakening first of all or
realization as you touched.

585
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:04,316
And then the second part you establish yourself.

586
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:27,316
In the third part we establish others.

587
00:56:27,316 --> 00:56:36,296
All right?

588
00:56:36,296 --> 00:57:04,095
Question: (repeated by Sahaja Yogi) Are You
speaking of Kundalini awakening?

589
00:57:04,095 --> 00:57:08,686
Others talk about it and then deliver the
goods, is this what You’re saying?

590
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:09,686
Yes.

591
00:57:09,686 --> 00:57:10,686
Shri Mataji: It’s true.

592
00:57:10,686 --> 00:57:11,686
That’s true.

593
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:13,496
Easy to talk about anything.

594
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:16,135
It’s true when one need not talk.

595
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:19,655
There’s no need to talk, it works silently.

596
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:22,246
It is working in all of you.

597
00:57:22,246 --> 00:57:28,226
That’s the right approach, who delivers
the good.

598
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:32,325
That’s right, he said the right thing.

599
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:35,835
Who delivers the good?

600
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:44,956
We can be satisfied with artificial things
you know, we can, we can be.

601
00:57:44,956 --> 00:58:05,196
Be careful on that point, you said the right
thing.

602
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:10,855
Correct.

603
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:23,056
Question: As a realized soul how can one help
social problems such as problems in Ethiopia

604
00:58:23,056 --> 00:58:24,056
and so on?

605
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:26,276
Shri Mataji: Well very much.

606
00:58:26,276 --> 00:58:32,895
Now Ethiopia’s problem comes from two angles,
two angles.

607
00:58:32,895 --> 00:58:37,036
First is Ethiopia you know that the Rastafarians.

608
00:58:37,036 --> 00:58:41,676
Have you heard about them?

609
00:58:41,676 --> 00:58:47,635
It comes from them; Rastafarians took to the
wrong side.

610
00:58:47,635 --> 00:58:52,096
In their religion itself you are supposed
to take the drugs and with taking drugs where

611
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,096
will you go?

612
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:58,276
Into your collective subconscious, and what
is in your collective subconscious is so injurious

613
00:58:58,276 --> 00:59:00,966
that it can give you cancer.

614
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:07,226
Cancer comes from the left side, which we
call as the collective subconscious.

615
00:59:07,226 --> 00:59:11,776
It can give all kinds of diseases, which cannot
be cured.

616
00:59:11,776 --> 00:59:16,256
Most of the incurable diseases come from there
and also the famine.

617
00:59:16,256 --> 00:59:19,885
The trees will burn.

618
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:25,335
If you want to find out about a person if
it is true or not see the flower.

619
00:59:25,335 --> 00:59:31,686
Flower will just burn off, if there’s a
person who is possessed by the left side,

620
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:33,716
it will just burn off.

621
00:59:33,716 --> 00:59:40,536
The cows will not give milk, all things will
happen in the nature, and when there are so

622
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:47,686
many people who are doing this nonsensical
thing and having all the left sided movement

623
00:59:47,686 --> 00:59:53,405
of their attention, they catch onto these
and that’s how the whole thing works on

624
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:54,706
their nature.

625
00:59:54,706 --> 00:59:57,905
That’s one thing.

626
00:59:57,905 --> 01:00:07,266
Now a realized soul if he goes to Ethiopia,
by his mere existence there, the nature may

627
01:00:07,266 --> 01:00:08,266
change.

628
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:14,615
If he is of a very evolved soul it will, even
with attention he can.

629
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:18,466
Now the second point is, what is gone wrong?

630
01:00:18,466 --> 01:00:26,085
You see this is what you say is the sin, the
sin, the wages of sin is fear, it’s much

631
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:28,066
more than fear.

632
01:00:28,066 --> 01:00:35,186
It acts, this is a sin to go to these things
and succumb to collective subconscious.

633
01:00:35,186 --> 01:00:42,355
Instead of rising higher, keeping in the center,
going to the right and the left we can call

634
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:46,276
it is the sin but in a very wider sense of
the word.

635
01:00:46,276 --> 01:00:47,276
All right?

636
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:53,405
Now this is one thing that the country has
indulged too much into the left side will

637
01:00:53,405 --> 01:01:03,236
be grabbed, will be definitely grabbed into
the power of negative forces, no doubt about

638
01:01:03,236 --> 01:01:04,236
it.

639
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:10,506
Their trees won’t grow, their flowers won’t
prosper, their children will die.

640
01:01:10,506 --> 01:01:14,866
They will have negative population, they will
have all problems of terrible diseases even

641
01:01:14,866 --> 01:01:15,866
AIDS comes.

642
01:01:15,866 --> 01:01:16,866
AIDS also comes from the same area.

643
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:17,866
It’s a very serious thing and when collectively
people start doing it, you just entering into

644
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:18,866
the satanic land where everything can work
out.

645
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:22,916
That’s one thing, no use giving them money,
it’s very temporary.

646
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:32,575
Easy money is the worst thing; you have to
give them something solid, something permanent,

647
01:01:32,575 --> 01:01:37,306
something eternal, something living, which
will make them grow.

648
01:01:37,306 --> 01:01:40,096
That’s one point.

649
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:46,486
The second point of Ethiopia is a very collective
happening, which happened in Ethiopia.

650
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:54,017
I met a minister by chance from Ethiopia who
was traveling with Me in the train and he

651
01:01:54,017 --> 01:02:00,556
told Me it was a political game.

652
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:11,436
The politics which is not benevolent is no
politics at all, it’s a dirty game; and

653
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:18,395
when you go to the extremes you see the falsehood
is such a nonsense, such an ignorance, such

654
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:24,296
a darkness that you start moving in it you
don’t know where you go till you reach your

655
01:02:24,296 --> 01:02:33,496
complete doom; and when you see that you don’t
understand what have we done, because to move

656
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:40,866
on a slope is the easiest and that’s how
Ethiopia has landed in trouble.

657
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:49,815
Third point which comes to Me very important
that applies to all the nations, whether they

658
01:02:49,815 --> 01:02:56,246
are developing or developed, that we don’t
realize that we are part and parcel of one

659
01:02:56,246 --> 01:02:58,096
world.

660
01:02:58,096 --> 01:03:02,716
God never created a separate world.

661
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:04,396
It’s one world.

662
01:03:04,396 --> 01:03:08,615
Like one human being it has a heart, all right?

663
01:03:08,615 --> 01:03:14,885
It has a liver, it has everything but it’s
one and that we are all part and parcel of

664
01:03:14,885 --> 01:03:15,885
this.

665
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:22,206
I would say that Roosevelt once said that
poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity

666
01:03:22,206 --> 01:03:28,835
everywhere, and when he said that I think
he understood the subtle thing.

667
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:32,736
Anywhere in the body there is poverty, means
if there is any disease is a threat to the

668
01:03:32,736 --> 01:03:34,756
whole body.

669
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:45,815
But for that we are not yet there, we are
not grown up, we are still so insular, so

670
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:46,815
insular.

671
01:03:46,815 --> 01:03:53,405
Like the other day we had a lady who was English,
I must say, she came, and in My house I have

672
01:03:53,405 --> 01:03:59,416
- because my husband is international diplomat
traveling a lot - we have got things from

673
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:06,936
everywhere and she only appreciated English
things, invariably even without knowing.

674
01:04:06,936 --> 01:04:16,346
She couldn’t appreciate anything even if
for sixth century, second century she wouldn’t.

675
01:04:16,346 --> 01:04:23,516
So insular, we are all insular, everywhere,
whether it’s Indian, whether it’s English

676
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:27,986
whether it’s American, we are very insular
people, self-opinionated.

677
01:04:27,986 --> 01:04:31,186
We are not global.

678
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:38,716
Unless and until we become global, problems
of the world cannot be solved.

679
01:04:38,716 --> 01:04:49,696
As if this finger of a leper is affected and
then there is no sensitivity in the whole

680
01:04:49,696 --> 01:04:50,696
body.

681
01:04:50,696 --> 01:04:56,496
Then what happens that if a rat comes and
takes away the finger the leper doesn’t

682
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:57,496
know.

683
01:04:57,496 --> 01:05:02,446
So the lepers if you go to a leper home they’ll
say, “Just have the light for us to see”,

684
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:09,605
but this light when it comes within you see
that we are part and parcel of the whole and

685
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:14,186
that’s how you grow up into the global personality.

686
01:05:14,186 --> 01:05:20,855
We are still English, British, Irish, Welsh.

687
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:25,516
I was surprised even the Welsh won’t like
them to be called British.

688
01:05:25,516 --> 01:05:28,385
I mean it’s such a little land like that.

689
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:35,256
Imagine in the heart if you have cells, which
do not call themselves cells of the heart,

690
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:37,936
what will happen to that heart?

691
01:05:37,936 --> 01:05:39,496
It will collapse.

692
01:05:39,496 --> 01:05:46,196
It is happening everywhere, it’s not only
in one country it’s the same as I said in

693
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:48,706
every country we are very insular people.

694
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:54,135
We have to expand and how do we expand, how
do we expand?

695
01:05:54,135 --> 01:05:55,966
Through our Spirit.

696
01:05:55,966 --> 01:06:01,266
As you can see the characters of these people
they were global they never talked about one

697
01:06:01,266 --> 01:06:06,375
country, two countries, three countries, they
talked for everyone.

698
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:17,075
This is the third big mistake, which all the
countries are doing and they are fighting,

699
01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:20,395
for what?

700
01:06:20,395 --> 01:06:23,616
Why are they all fighting, why are they having
wars?

701
01:06:23,616 --> 01:06:25,866
God did not create wars, did He?

702
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:28,206
It’s not His mistake.

703
01:06:28,206 --> 01:06:35,536
This world belongs to Him and not to us.

704
01:06:35,536 --> 01:06:48,606
All theories they become self-destructive
how can that be called as a benevolent politics?

705
01:06:48,606 --> 01:07:05,246
In Sahaja Yoga we will have the politics of
Socrates, of giving and of not taking.

706
01:07:05,246 --> 01:07:12,395
But we have to have that race raised into
that personality that global personality.

707
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,296
Can I do it alone?

708
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:27,946
You all have to help Me.

709
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:44,626
Question: She’s no will power whatsoever,
She’s been a drug addict for 15 years, She

710
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:45,885
just wonder she can….

711
01:07:45,885 --> 01:07:55,926
Shri Mataji: Don’t you worry, it’s all
there it will come back don’t you worry,

712
01:07:55,926 --> 01:07:57,335
all right?

713
01:07:57,335 --> 01:07:59,456
Don’t you worry.

714
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:09,036
Love is the most powerful thing, we have never
used the power of love, don’t you worry.

715
01:08:09,036 --> 01:08:27,085
Question: I followed Swami Vivekananda for
years, advocated stern practices for years

716
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:28,416
and years ….

717
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:43,066
Shri Mataji: Now he is dead and gone, all
right [laughter…applause].

718
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:47,746
I’m sitting here; I’m your Mother, all
right?

719
01:08:47,746 --> 01:08:54,385
I agree, I know, I know all that, all horrid
things forget it.

720
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:58,326
I’m your Mother, all right?

721
01:08:58,326 --> 01:09:01,736
If I can work it out only with My love, why
should you worry about Vivekananda?

722
01:09:01,736 --> 01:09:06,575
It’s all right, forget it, that’s over.

723
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,226
You have done it in previous life.

724
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:12,816
Vivekananda had to do it in this life but
you have done it before, all right?

725
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:15,746
You all have finished with it, now you just
get your prizes.

726
01:09:15,746 --> 01:09:23,456
[Shri Mataji and everyone laughs]You don’t
have

727
01:09:23,456 --> 01:09:25,615
to do anything like that.

728
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:34,815
You see a person who has to cook who has never
cooked before has to go through all rigmarole.

729
01:09:34,815 --> 01:09:36,405
But supposing your Mother knows cooking.

730
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,635
She’s done the cooking.

731
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:40,006
Come along and have the food, finished.

732
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:42,036
Why to worry?

733
01:09:42,036 --> 01:09:44,216
All right?

734
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:50,335
It’s already made.

735
01:09:50,335 --> 01:09:52,565
You are a seeker, you have been a seeker.

736
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:58,655
You have done all that many lives, you’ve
been to Himalayas so now forget it, forget

737
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,676
it.

738
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:02,556
Better have it, all right?

739
01:10:02,556 --> 01:10:07,526
There are so many here I can see that kind.

740
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:14,625
Question: Can we have the food that You’ve
prepared?

741
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,956
Shri Mataji: You’re hungry, that’s great.

742
01:10:16,956 --> 01:10:18,916
Let’s have it, all right?

743
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:19,916
Should we?

744
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:25,635
Now do not analyze anymore, just have it,
don’t analyze, when you’re hungry you

745
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:30,585
don’t analyze from where did you get it,
what has happened, how (will) you cook it.

746
01:10:30,585 --> 01:10:31,766
You just see the fun, that’s all.

747
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:34,726
You just enjoy it, that’s a good idea.

748
01:10:34,726 --> 01:10:51,256
Question: After you die, would you like to
go to heaven or do you wish to stay around?

749
01:10:51,256 --> 01:10:54,936
Shri Mataji: Who I?

750
01:10:54,936 --> 01:10:56,655
I die?

751
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:59,746
I think of the present never of the future.

752
01:10:59,746 --> 01:11:06,027
You be in the present, don’t worry about
the future.

753
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:11,506
We should worry about the present, that’s
why you see Buddha talked about the Self.

754
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:13,555
Why talk of the future?

755
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:16,105
Doesn’t exist for Me.

756
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,926
Question: Present and future bind together

757
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:26,466
Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes but you become first
the present, otherwise there’s no binding.

758
01:11:26,466 --> 01:11:31,476
Either you are in the future or in the past,
first of all become the present.

759
01:11:31,476 --> 01:11:36,026
There’s no binding, that’s the chain is
missing, that’s why I’m saying become

760
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:37,026
the present.

761
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,625
All right?

762
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:52,486
Question: I want to know the answer, are You
going to stay around or are You going to go

763
01:11:52,486 --> 01:11:54,355
to heaven when You die?

764
01:11:54,355 --> 01:12:12,856
Shri Mataji: I’m already in heaven (laughter…
applause) would you like to join Me?

765
01:12:12,856 --> 01:12:15,976
You please join Me in heaven, all right?

766
01:12:15,976 --> 01:12:18,216
I’m already in heaven.

767
01:12:18,216 --> 01:12:25,266
I see the heaven around Me everywhere, only
thing you have to enter into that subtle thing.

768
01:12:25,266 --> 01:12:30,365
It’s so beautiful; it’s so beautiful.

769
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:46,596
All right, now you don’t have to do much,
but as I said we have problems within ourselves.

770
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:53,456
We have to little bit work out ourselves,
our awakening and doing so you will know also

771
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:56,746
later on if the Kundalini falls off how to
raise it.

772
01:12:56,746 --> 01:12:59,226
It’s very simple, not much.

773
01:12:59,226 --> 01:13:06,516
You have to use your left and right hand because
as Mohamed Sahib has said that at the time

774
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:12,026
of resurrection your hands will speak, in
the sense that you get your collective consciousness

775
01:13:12,026 --> 01:13:15,135
and your fingertips become enlightened.

776
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:20,716
So as all the doctors will also say that we
have a sympathetic nervous system acting on

777
01:13:20,716 --> 01:13:22,256
our fingertips.

778
01:13:22,256 --> 01:13:30,365
Now when you put the left hand towards Me,
it represents your desire to be self realized.

779
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:35,315
So just you have to put your left hand like
this nothing else is to be done - simple,

780
01:13:35,315 --> 01:13:37,976
but in a humble way.

781
01:13:37,976 --> 01:13:44,696
If you say, “now give me realization”,
all right, but we have to be humble.

782
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:45,986
That’s very important.

783
01:13:45,986 --> 01:13:51,956
When we are humble, we are peaceful and the
thing works out faster.

784
01:13:51,956 --> 01:13:54,836
So do not analyze it just get it.

785
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:58,115
It’s simple how to eat the food I’m just
telling you.

786
01:13:58,115 --> 01:14:00,595
Put your left hand straight like this.

787
01:14:00,595 --> 01:14:05,956
First of all it’s better to take the advantage
of Mother Earth so you have to take out your

788
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:06,956
shoes.

789
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:09,546
You can keep your socks but better to take
out your shoes, because sometimes they can

790
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:16,885
be very tight and your hats.

791
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:25,416
Anything tight, which makes you uncomfortable,
should be loosened, that’s all.

792
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:30,596
Now, just put your left hand straight like
this.

793
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:36,016
Everyone should try to do it, it’s very
simple, it’s not going to take much time,

794
01:14:36,016 --> 01:14:37,856
it’s very simple.

795
01:14:37,856 --> 01:14:44,556
Nothing is going to happen to you but, on
the contrary, you will become at least ten

796
01:14:44,556 --> 01:14:48,565
years younger, that’s a promise.

797
01:14:48,565 --> 01:14:53,446
You see a mother when she gives castor oil,
also she has to cover it with some chocolates.

798
01:14:53,446 --> 01:14:59,326
So now this is one of the temptations for
many people must be, but there are so many

799
01:14:59,326 --> 01:15:03,246
other things that I cannot describe in this
short lecture.

800
01:15:03,246 --> 01:15:07,486
So I would say that just put your left hand
because this is your own power within you,

801
01:15:07,486 --> 01:15:10,796
which you do not know, just put your left
hand just like this.

802
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:16,115
All of you please put your left hand on your
lap very comfortably.

803
01:15:16,115 --> 01:15:21,256
Now your right hand is the one, which is the
power of action.

804
01:15:21,256 --> 01:15:31,305
With this you act, so you have to use your
right hand just first on your heart centre

805
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:34,595
then because in the heart resides the Spirit.

806
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:39,176
Then I’ll tell you one by one, but just
now can see on the upper part of the stomach,

807
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:46,085
in the lower part of the stomach, then again
in the upper part of the stomach, then on

808
01:15:46,085 --> 01:15:52,676
the heart, then here, then here, then here.

809
01:15:52,676 --> 01:15:59,005
I will tell you one by one everywhere and
then on top of your head here, stretch your

810
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:03,826
hand palm, put it down there and press it
hard, that’s all.

811
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:04,826
It’s very simple.

812
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:10,375
Now this all has to be done with the right
hand, just remember this one point and left

813
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,375
hand here.

814
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:13,005
What are these centers?

815
01:16:13,005 --> 01:16:14,886
I will tell you.

816
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:16,866
One by one, you need not remember.

817
01:16:16,866 --> 01:16:22,516
It’s all in the book, but just now you know
that it is to be worked out on the left-hand

818
01:16:22,516 --> 01:16:23,516
side.

819
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:30,005
Because left-hand side is our desire and we
are putting our hand of our desire.

820
01:16:30,005 --> 01:16:36,605
Now the left hand is already quite heavy I
must say, all right, so now.

821
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:44,956
You put your left hand just like this and
at the very outset, as I’ve told in every

822
01:16:44,956 --> 01:16:51,916
Western program, you have to forgive yourself.

823
01:16:51,916 --> 01:17:03,556
You’re not to feel guilty for anything whatsoever
even for reading Vivekananda.

824
01:17:03,556 --> 01:17:08,686
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself;
after all you are the temple of God.

825
01:17:08,686 --> 01:17:17,246
So don’t despise yourself, don’t think
low of yourself, forgive yourself and say

826
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:20,416
with full confidence that you’re not guilty.

827
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:26,446
This is a fashion also, everybody wants to
say “I’m guilty.”

828
01:17:26,446 --> 01:17:28,796
It’s a fashion, it’s just a fashion.

829
01:17:28,796 --> 01:17:36,746
So please don’t consider yourself guilty
for anything you have done in the past what

830
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:38,176
you think of the future.

831
01:17:38,176 --> 01:17:47,766
Let your present come up and then you will
know that all these were mythical ideas.

832
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:49,916
The truth has to come.

833
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:53,726
So now you have to close your eyes.

834
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:55,425
Don’t open your eyes.

835
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:59,766
There’s no mesmerism going on, so no need
to keep the eyes open.

836
01:17:59,766 --> 01:18:05,996
But in any case keep your eyes shut till I
tell you to open, because when the Kundalini

837
01:18:05,996 --> 01:18:08,396
is rising it’s better to keep your attention
inside.

838
01:18:08,396 --> 01:18:15,196
At least through the eyes the attention goes
out, so if you keep your eyes closed the Kundalini

839
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:18,496
rises much better.

840
01:18:18,496 --> 01:18:23,626
Sometimes She does not rise if your attention
is out, so I know attention cannot be inside,

841
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:29,606
but when you close your eyes at least it is
not going out too much.

842
01:18:29,606 --> 01:18:36,046
So the Kundalini rises and It sucks in all
your attention, like I can say in My sari

843
01:18:36,046 --> 01:18:41,275
if I have the Kundalini rising like that it
sucks in the sari like the attention, In the

844
01:18:41,275 --> 01:18:45,476
same way it goes up and ultimately pierces
through here.

845
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:50,386
It should happen, you all should certify yourself,
nobody needs certify you.

846
01:18:50,386 --> 01:18:54,396
Once you say you are feeling the cool breeze
then you can ask somebody to see you.

847
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:59,326
If you are not feeling it, don’t get desperate,
you all can feel it.

848
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:05,136
There are so many here sitting and I’m sure
you can be told and helped.

849
01:19:05,136 --> 01:19:07,546
And then once you get it, you have to help
others.

850
01:19:07,546 --> 01:19:13,146
That’s how we are going to work it out.

851
01:19:13,146 --> 01:19:21,896
So now please put left hand like this, right
hand on your heart.

852
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:28,666
Now here close your eyes.

853
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:39,376
In the heart resides the Spirit, so please
ask Me three times a question in your heart,

854
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:41,606
not loudly.

855
01:19:41,606 --> 01:19:46,136
Please ask Me sincerely a question.

856
01:19:46,136 --> 01:19:53,746
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can
call Me “Mother”, whatever you like.

857
01:19:53,746 --> 01:19:56,576
“Mother, am I the Spirit?

858
01:19:56,576 --> 01:19:59,396
Mother, am I the Spirit?

859
01:19:59,396 --> 01:20:01,766
Mother, am I the Spirit?”

860
01:20:01,766 --> 01:20:07,775
Now this is a fundamental question you’re
asking to a computer, which has to give you

861
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:27,086
the answer.

862
01:20:27,086 --> 01:20:50,956
Now this question is followed by another question
when you put your right hand in the upper

863
01:20:50,956 --> 01:20:54,396
part of your stomach on the left-hand side.

864
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:58,316
You’re working everything on the left-hand
side and press it hard.

865
01:20:58,316 --> 01:21:09,076
Now here is the centre, which gives you the
power of mastery over yourself, the mastery

866
01:21:09,076 --> 01:21:15,445
over the divine knowledge, the mastery over
the working of the divine knowledge.

867
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:20,976
That means you become your own master, you
become your own guru, nobody can dominate

868
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:26,786
you, nothing can dominate you, no habits can
dominate you.

869
01:21:26,786 --> 01:21:33,816
So at this point you press your fingers dig
them down here you have to ask the second

870
01:21:33,816 --> 01:21:39,505
question to me, Mother am I my own master?

871
01:21:39,505 --> 01:21:46,996
Ask this questions three times please, with
full faith in yourself ask this question:

872
01:21:46,996 --> 01:21:48,925
“Mother, am I my own master?

873
01:21:48,925 --> 01:21:52,796
“ This will neutralize all your useless
feelings and everything.

874
01:21:52,796 --> 01:22:18,336
“Mother am I my own master?”

875
01:22:18,336 --> 01:22:27,255
Now please take your hand down in the lower
part of your abdomen and press it hard there

876
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:31,396
on the left-hand side, keep the left hand
towards me.

877
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:43,976
Now here is the centre, which is working out
the divine technique, the pure knowledge,

878
01:22:43,976 --> 01:22:51,215
the true art of this technique is worked out
through this centre here.

879
01:22:51,215 --> 01:23:03,146
At this centre I cannot force you in any way
that you should ask me for your self-realization.

880
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:12,126
It should be your own desire free will ask
for it.

881
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:26,116
So here you please ask Me, “Mother, may
I have the true knowledge?”

882
01:23:26,116 --> 01:23:31,056
This has to be said six times because there
are six petals to this center.

883
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:42,856
“Mother, may I have the true knowledge,
the pure knowledge of the divine technique?”

884
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:45,755
(Why don’t you do?

885
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:51,556
You’re so young, please try, it’s very
easy.

886
01:23:51,556 --> 01:23:54,755
For young people to be that adamant is not
good.

887
01:23:54,755 --> 01:24:02,966
But please try, it’s worth it.)

888
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:06,366
Six times please.

889
01:24:06,366 --> 01:24:57,046
You must learn to listen and sometimes understand,
all right?

890
01:24:57,046 --> 01:25:03,275
Now raise this hand again on the left-hand
side, on the same center of the principle

891
01:25:03,275 --> 01:25:12,456
of the mastery on the upper part of your abdomen
of your stomach, on the left-hand side, And

892
01:25:12,456 --> 01:25:15,735
now press it hard.

893
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:26,436
This center has got ten petals, so here now
you have to help your Kundalini to rise by

894
01:25:26,436 --> 01:25:36,945
asserting the truth, by saying ten times with
full confidence in yourself, “Mother I am

895
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:38,976
my master.

896
01:25:38,976 --> 01:25:42,706
Mother I am my own master.

897
01:25:42,706 --> 01:25:44,846
Mother I am my own master.”

898
01:25:44,846 --> 01:26:30,046
Please say it ten times.

899
01:26:30,046 --> 01:26:39,046
Now again you raise your hand on top of your
heart and put it there with full confidence

900
01:26:39,046 --> 01:26:46,826
here, as this centre has got twelve petals
you have to say with full confidence in yourself

901
01:26:46,826 --> 01:26:49,985
the truth, “Mother I am the Sprit.”

902
01:26:49,985 --> 01:26:56,476
You are the Spirit, so please say with full
confidence, “Mother I am the Spirit.”

903
01:26:56,476 --> 01:27:27,675
Believe Me, you are the Spirit.

904
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:48,175
Twelve times.

905
01:27:48,175 --> 01:27:57,255
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of God’s love.

906
01:27:57,255 --> 01:28:04,846
It is the ocean of His forgiveness and you
cannot do anything that He cannot forgive.

907
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:10,586
He’s that powerful, His forgiveness is that
powerful, so there’s no need for you to

908
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:23,715
feel guilty about anything whatsoever, by
that you’re challenging His power of forgiveness.

909
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:39,405
So now you raise your hand in the angle of
your neck and your shoulder and push it back

910
01:28:39,405 --> 01:28:42,316
towards the spinal chord and press it very
hard.

911
01:28:42,316 --> 01:28:45,536
Now this is the most difficult center in the
West.

912
01:28:45,536 --> 01:28:50,755
As I said, when you feel guilty you catch
this center and you get all kinds of troubles

913
01:28:50,755 --> 01:28:59,436
like angina also troubles like spondylitis
and so many other problems.

914
01:28:59,436 --> 01:29:10,376
Now press it hard and with full confidence,
you say sixteen times, “Mother I’m not

915
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:14,556
guilty.”

916
01:29:14,556 --> 01:29:16,026
Sixteen times.

917
01:29:16,026 --> 01:29:24,106
You have to be pleasant with yourself; you
have to cherish yourself and not to condemn

918
01:29:24,106 --> 01:29:27,896
yourself at all by any chance.

919
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:31,606
You are not guilty.

920
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:34,996
So please say, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all” sixteen times.

921
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:42,546
But those who still want to go ahead with
it punish themselves by saying it 108 times.

922
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:43,546
That would be the best.

923
01:29:43,546 --> 01:29:48,836
(Shri Mataji blowing on her hand and rubbing
Her hands) So much heat coming out from there,

924
01:29:48,836 --> 01:29:50,766
so much of heat.

925
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:58,646
“I’m not guilty.”

926
01:29:58,646 --> 01:30:03,106
Put your left hand towards Me, say with full
confidence.

927
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:10,606
Wow, this is the worst hurdle, I tell you.

928
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:19,356
It’s just a myth; it’s a conception in
your head that you’re guilty.

929
01:30:19,356 --> 01:30:28,386
What guilt can you have that cannot be washed
by the great power of God’s love and forgiveness?

930
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:39,726
(Shri Mataji is rubbing Her hands) Sixteen
times or 108 times.

931
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:42,706
You do not know how to love yourself.

932
01:30:42,706 --> 01:30:44,606
You’re supposed to be selfish but there’s
no selfishness I think.

933
01:30:44,606 --> 01:31:28,076
(Shri Mataji is blowing hard and rubbing Her
hands)

934
01:31:28,076 --> 01:31:40,152
Now raise this hand on your forehead across
and press it on both the sides.

935
01:31:43,434 --> 01:31:49,934
Now, here is the center where you have to
forgive others.

936
01:31:50,075 --> 01:31:57,695
I will not say how many times but from your
heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,

937
01:31:57,695 --> 01:32:01,854
I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone.”

938
01:32:01,854 --> 01:32:08,615
Now maybe you might say it’s very difficult,
but it’s not all because it is mythical.

939
01:32:08,615 --> 01:32:11,655
What do you do by not forgiving or forgiving?

940
01:32:11,655 --> 01:32:17,055
Is nothing, but when you don’t forgive you
play into the hands of wrong people.

941
01:32:17,055 --> 01:32:22,805
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,
everyone I forgive.”

942
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:27,025
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given
us - to forgive.

943
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:33,846
Forgive everyone, forgive everyone, forgive
everyone.

944
01:32:50,807 --> 01:32:54,255
Now for

945
01:32:54,255 --> 01:33:02,805
your own satisfaction you may put your hand
on the backside of your head, backside of

946
01:33:02,805 --> 01:33:04,265
your head.

947
01:33:04,265 --> 01:33:14,104
Here is the center where you have to say that
“If I have done anything wrong against the

948
01:33:14,104 --> 01:33:15,745
Divine, please forgive me.”

949
01:33:15,745 --> 01:33:24,035
You have to ask the Divine the forgiveness,
so that there’s no doubt in your mind or

950
01:33:24,035 --> 01:33:27,425
sort of lurking guilt.

951
01:33:27,425 --> 01:33:42,505
Say that three times of from your heart it
will work out, but don’t count the mistakes,

952
01:33:42,505 --> 01:33:44,585
so called.

953
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:46,695
Just say that, saying is sufficient.

954
01:33:46,695 --> 01:33:53,894
Saying is the enlightened chanting, all right?

955
01:33:53,894 --> 01:34:02,975
Now stretch your hand put it on top of your
head, bend you head a little bit forward.

956
01:34:02,975 --> 01:34:16,075
On top of your head, bend it and now rub it
hard the scalp seven times.

957
01:34:16,075 --> 01:34:22,405
Here again I cannot cross your freedom, so
you have to say, “Mother, I want my Realization.”

958
01:34:22,405 --> 01:34:25,894
I cannot force it on you, so just say, “I
want my Realization.”

959
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:29,255
I can only persuade you, but I cannot force
it.

960
01:34:29,255 --> 01:34:30,885
You have to ask for it.

961
01:34:30,885 --> 01:34:36,905
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
may I have my realization?

962
01:34:36,905 --> 01:34:46,874
Please give me my Realization” seven times.

963
01:34:46,874 --> 01:35:10,255
(Shri Mataji blows seven times into the microphone)

964
01:35:10,255 --> 01:35:19,745
Now bring down your right hand, put it towards
Me.

965
01:35:19,745 --> 01:35:29,455
Slowly open your eyes and put your left hand
bending your head a little bit on top of your

966
01:35:29,455 --> 01:35:34,584
head here, little higher and see if there’s
a cool breeze coming out.

967
01:35:34,584 --> 01:35:39,795
With the left hand you see, not with the right,
right hand towards Me, the right hand towards

968
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:46,024
Me, the left hand just try to see if you’re
feeling any cool breeze out of your head,

969
01:35:46,024 --> 01:35:47,865
all right?

970
01:35:47,865 --> 01:35:50,615
Don’t get upset.

971
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:59,785
If you’re not feeling doesn’t matter,
we’ll work it out.

972
01:35:59,785 --> 01:36:01,624
Doesn’t matter.

973
01:36:01,624 --> 01:36:07,955
Now turn it round again put it here the right
hand, see with the right hand if you’re

974
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:09,045
feeling the cool breeze.

975
01:36:09,045 --> 01:36:12,005
Some people don’t feel it, doesn’t matter.

976
01:36:12,005 --> 01:36:15,475
Nothing so desperately bad.

977
01:36:15,475 --> 01:36:27,544
There is, I can see that.

978
01:36:27,544 --> 01:36:47,235
Now left hand again, little higher, maybe
little higher, some people feel it very high

979
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:53,334
you see, it shoots off, just see.

980
01:36:53,334 --> 01:36:59,235
Now you may put your hand up towards the sky
and ask the question, “Is this the All-Pervading

981
01:36:59,235 --> 01:37:01,195
Power of God’s love?

982
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:04,604
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

983
01:37:04,604 --> 01:37:07,644
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

984
01:37:07,644 --> 01:37:13,985
Ask the question three times.

985
01:37:13,985 --> 01:37:29,465
Now, such a lot, all the Sahaja Yogis sitting
here.

986
01:37:29,465 --> 01:37:31,455
Are you feeling?

987
01:37:31,455 --> 01:37:32,785
Cool breeze?

988
01:37:32,785 --> 01:37:34,115
Or what?

989
01:37:34,115 --> 01:37:35,115
Something happening?

990
01:37:35,115 --> 01:37:40,545
Now put back your hand, now don’t analyze
it just see in the hands are you feeling any

991
01:37:40,545 --> 01:37:43,644
cool breeze in the hands.

992
01:37:43,644 --> 01:37:55,385
All right, little bit, some feel a little
bit; but it’s all right, the beginning has

993
01:37:55,385 --> 01:37:56,845
started.

994
01:37:56,845 --> 01:38:03,995
Now most of you have got the right hands less,
so put the right hand towards Me, left hand

995
01:38:03,995 --> 01:38:07,225
like this towards the sky, it will ventilate.

996
01:38:07,225 --> 01:38:23,585
Left hand like this and now forgive, forgive
everyone, everyone you forgive, just forgive.

997
01:38:23,585 --> 01:38:26,455
That’s the mantra.

998
01:38:26,455 --> 01:38:30,995
It will release, left hand up.

999
01:38:30,995 --> 01:38:34,615
Right hand towards Me and left hand up.

1000
01:38:34,615 --> 01:38:38,945
Now right hand towards Me.

1001
01:38:38,945 --> 01:38:40,967
Moving, is it?

1002
01:38:40,967 --> 01:38:52,035
Slowly, slowly it will move, right hand is
difficult because mostly we are very right-sided

1003
01:38:52,035 --> 01:38:55,015
people, mostly.

1004
01:38:55,015 --> 01:38:57,995
Yes, good.

1005
01:38:57,995 --> 01:39:05,366
Now with the left hand you put towards Me
and right hand towards the Mother Earth like

1006
01:39:05,366 --> 01:39:07,775
this.

1007
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:11,345
Left hand towards Me and right hand towards
the Mother earth.

1008
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:17,785
This is what we are doing: we are correcting
the elements within us, bringing them into

1009
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:18,975
balance.

1010
01:39:18,975 --> 01:39:23,355
Which you will know very soon what it was,
what we were doing.

1011
01:39:23,355 --> 01:39:24,604
You’ll know everything.

1012
01:39:24,604 --> 01:39:31,065
No, no left towards Me, left towards Me and
right towards the Mother Earth.

1013
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:33,215
Right towards the Mother Earth.

1014
01:39:33,215 --> 01:39:36,385
Left towards Me, right towards the Mother
Earth.

1015
01:39:36,385 --> 01:39:39,585
Mmm, better.

1016
01:39:39,585 --> 01:39:42,785
