1
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:55,680
Merry Christmas and all the blessings for 
the next year.

2
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,850
Today we are not going to have a very long 
puja, but there are certain things which we

3
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:10,990
have to understand from the life of Christ.

4
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:30,240
Christ was born in a very poor conditions, 
just to show that spirituality can live in

5
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
any circumstances and under any problems.

6
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,000
And He had to face so much opposition from 
His own clan.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,600
He was born in a Jew family and that time 
the Jews would not accept Him.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,570
But they did not kill Him, that's the main 
point, we should understand.

9
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,650
They did not kill Him.

10
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,360
Under no law a multitude can kill.

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:06,380
Is the judge, who was a Roman judge from the 
Roman Empire who actually ordered His death.

12
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:17,520
It is very difficult to follow His life because 
He was absolutely a Divine personality, absolutely.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,459
And that's why He - whatever rules and regulations 
He has passed for the Christians are really

14
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:28,440
very difficult to follow, very difficult.

15
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,680
I don't think very few people are even able 
to follow His life.

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,740
It's very difficult because He said that if 
you commit any adultery with your eyes, you

17
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,450
better take out.

18
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:53,050
You cut your hand if you do any crime with 
it.

19
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,720
For Him, the crime was also a very subtle 
thing.

20
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,090
Turn your left cheek if somebody slaps you 
on the right cheek.

21
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,310
To follow this kind of a difficult, very, 
very difficult thing was impossible.

22
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:16,950
And also He said that you have to do it, not 
others.

23
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,210
He lived for such a short time.

24
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,240
He visited India and stayed here.

25
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:30,100
I've read a book about it and I was surprised 
that in the Puranas, is written very clearly

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,410
in Sanskrit language, which perhaps the writer 
didn't understand, and where Shalivanha, My

27
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:46,820
forefathers, he met Him, and he said to Him 
that what is Your name?

28
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,180
He said, "My name is Issa Massih", and I have 
come to this country because My country is

29
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,400
full of melechas.

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,069
Melecha means Mal ich, those have only tendencies 
toward collecting filth.

31
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,570
So he said, "But what are you doing here?

32
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,820
You go back to your own country and teach 
them the "Nirmala Param Tatwam."

33
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,840
It's very surprisingly; he used these words 
so clearly.

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,510
So the whole thing was printed in Sanskrit.

35
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,079
Perhaps the writer never understood what was 
in Sanskrit language.

36
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,360
And then he said, "It is - You can only go 
and reform them and You can clear them."

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,940
But look at it, He tried to do the good and 
people crucified him.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:41,770
If you see the Christian religion now, you 
don't know what to say about it.

39
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:49,009
They have been always opposing Sahaja Yoga 
and also they have never tried to understand

40
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,310
that Christ has said that I will send you 
the Holy Ghost.

41
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,680
Also, some Sahaja Yogis who are supposed to 
be coming from Christian conditionings stick

42
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
to that.

43
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Now no more.

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,719
There is no Christ.

45
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:09,569
Of course, we accept that it was very important 
for Him to come on this Earth and to help

46
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:10,569
us out.

47
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,740
The steps on which you are, you have to leave 
that step to go out to the higher stage.

48
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,500
That doesn't mean you should not worship Christ.

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,580
You should worship, but it is not the way 
some people are still very much fond of sticking

50
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,509
on to it.

51
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:41,800
while He is the one who prepared you for Sahaja 
Yoga.

52
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,831
I don't know what you can adapt from His life.

53
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:52,659
He was the greatest Sahaja Yogi, but He had 
so many powers, which are difficult for human

54
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,289
beings to have.

55
00:05:54,289 --> 00:06:05,069
But His sacrifices, His adjustments, acceptance 
of whatever was told to Him, He accepted.

56
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:13,599
His love for His Mother and on the cross He 
said, "Behold the Mother!", He just said,

57
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,469
"Behold the Mother."

58
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:22,169
Whatever it is, we have to know also that 
the Bible is not completely representing Christ,

59
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,699
as it has happened with every book.

60
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:35,680
So, there are problems and, as in every religion, 
people have gone astray from their right path,

61
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,479
and are spoiling the name of the people who 
have been Divine and who started those religions.

62
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,099
Also is happened in the Christian nation.

63
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:49,979
Just the opposite of what Christ has said, 
they are doing.

64
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:59,780
For us, one has to realize that He came on 
this Earth to open our Agnya chakra, which

65
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,500
is a very difficult thing.

66
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,360
Sahasrara is not difficult as Agnya.

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,449
Agnya chakra is a very constricted chakra 
on which He resides.

68
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:21,900
And He has said, "You have to forgive yourself 
and forgive others."

69
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:34,939
This is the mantra of the Agnya chakra.

70
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:40,569
That is in the Beejakshara we call it "Ham 
Sham."

71
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,469
Sham is to forgive others.

72
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,520
Ham is to forgive yourself.

73
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,590
These are the two Beejaksharas are used for 
Agnya chakra opening.

74
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,940
To open the Agnya chakra best is to go into 
thoughtless awareness.

75
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,780
To be in thoughtless awareness, Agnya can 
open.

76
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,879
But Agnya, if it is closed, it can be very 
dangerous, very dangerous, and can harm you

77
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,229
or harm others.

78
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:11,180
Sometimes, people who are possessed also get 
those possessions in their Agnya chakra and

79
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:19,870
they'll start acting according to the mutation 
of these horrible, evil forces within them.

80
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:26,070
As a result, these evil forces take over and 
we don't know why such a person is behaving

81
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,389
in this manner.

82
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:36,280
Now, as we know that in America they have 
been doing lots of research, this this genes.

83
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,010
They're talking about so many things, which 
they never talked about.

84
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:47,529
Despite that, all the horrible, terrible diseases 
are coming back with vengeance.

85
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,630
They can't understand why it is happening.

86
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,860
With all this research, with all this work, 
people are getting very sick and it is beyond

87
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,170
them to understand why these things are happening.

88
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:07,000
The main thing is, you have to be under the 
protection of spirituality, under the protection

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,700
of morality, under the protection of Divine 
Laws.

90
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,650
If you're not under that protection, you can 
get caught up into anything.

91
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,750
America especially, I find, is gone really 
amuck as far as religion is concerned.

92
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,150
They have all kinds of religions, they have 
even religions of the devil, religions of

93
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,870
the witchcraft.

94
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,020
Every sort of religion they have.

95
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,640
Though they have advanced so much in science, 
they are living in terror all the time.

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:50,170
Firstly, one must accept, that morality is 
what Christ has taught us, of a very deep

97
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,220
essential nature, very deep.

98
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,450
He said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

99
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,150
Even in the eyes, there should not be adultery.

100
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,350
You look at one woman, all right.

101
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,020
Second time, if you look at that woman, then 
you are adulterous.

102
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,960
Such strict rules he has passed about his 
own idea of a moral personality.

103
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:22,840
Now, as you are Sahaja Yogis, you are already 
quite equipped, you are quite equipped and

104
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,260
you can follow His principles easily than 
other people can.

105
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:34,340
But still, some things I have to tell you, 
as Christ has said that I will tolerate everything

106
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:43,630
against Me, but nothing against 
the Holy Ghost.

107
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,540
It's very remarkable thing to say.

108
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,590
He's the Ocean of Forgiveness, and there He 
says, "Everything I'll tolerate, but nothing

109
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,490
against the Holy Ghost."

110
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:04,460
So many things are happening, So many things 
are happening, which amazes people.

111
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:13,660
For example, here only, in Ganapatipule, there 
was one funny fellow who came up with some

112
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,130
sort of a opposition to Sahaja Yoga.

113
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:27,631
And he got hold of the village man called 
as the Mamlatdar, means he's an officer and

114
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:31,950
both of them combined together started troubling 
us.

115
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,430
Just before our coming ten days, this Mamlatdar 
was suspended.

116
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,040
Nobody could understand.

117
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,980
How was he suspended suddenly?

118
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
How?

119
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
What happened?

120
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,220
Like that - is this is Christ, is His work, 
Ganesha's work.

121
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,480
Left and right, so many people - I, I am not 
bothered about it.

122
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,700
I don't want anybody to be destroyed.

123
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:03,910
But it is They, who are trying to destroy 
all those who come in the way of Sahaja Yoga

124
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,260
and it is very amazing how things are happening 
and how it is working out.

125
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,820
So we should have no fear at all, if people 
oppose us, they try to do anything.

126
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,790
Suddenly, you'll find some solution will come 
out and you'll be amazed at it.

127
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:26,350
So many things happen like that and have been 
happening all over and I have so many letters

128
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:34,510
from people saying how they have been helped 
by our Lord Jesus Christ.

129
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,720
I don't have to tell them, they know their 
job very well.

130
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,320
But as Sahaja Yogis, what should we have as 
our code of conduct?

131
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,540
It's very important, as they call "Acharsahita."

132
00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:01,930
The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga, 
you have to know that you have to recognize

133
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,870
Me.

134
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,350
That is very important.

135
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,900
Very humbly, I have to tell you - you have 
to recognize Me and you have to respect Me

136
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,470
and love Me.

137
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:26,010
If in these words, if I can explain to you, 
that you cannot have a double life.

138
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,690
You cannot show love and another side you 
try to trouble Me.

139
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:40,160
First thing is that so far there has been 
no en-mass realization, no en-mass realization

140
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,870
and when there is no en-mass realization, 
we cannot blame the people if they did not

141
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,630
recognize these incarnations, because without 
realization, how can they recognize?

142
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:03,250
But after en-mass realization, if you do not 
recognize, then it's a serious thing.

143
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,730
You should not be addicted to your previous 
nonsensical stuff that you had.

144
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:17,970
In the same, same like some, there are Hindus, 
if I tell them that now finish with all these

145
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:25,120
temples and this fasting and all those brahmic 
nonsense, they don't like it.

146
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
You have to.

147
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,750
Now you have become saints.

148
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:33,030
For saints, there is no caste, no community, 
no race.

149
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,880
Anyway, and you tell to anyone, they don't 
like it.

150
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,610
If you tell it to Jains, they won't like.

151
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,400
If you tell it to Buddhists, they won't like.

152
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,660
They just want to stick on to the old style 
which their forefather's, their forefather's,

153
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,450
forefathers have been doing so far.

154
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:57,640
So recognition only mean, doesn't mean that 
you recognize Me as Adi Shakti, but recognition

155
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:08,120
means that in every part of your life, you 
should know that I am with you.

156
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:16,990
Disciplining in Sahaja Yoga has to be automatic.

157
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:25,820
I don't have to tell you about disciplining, 
but it doesn't work out, then I have to tell

158
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
you.

159
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,670
The first discipline, is that you have to 
recognize Me and respect Me.

160
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:39,930
Then the second discipline, is you have to 
learn how to be a Sahaja Yogi.

161
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:49,670
Think of Christ, if He is sitting here, how 
would He behave towards Me or He would behave

162
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,090
towards others who are here.

163
00:15:52,090 --> 00:16:00,300
Very difficult for Him to accept all, any 
kind of nonsense from anyone.

164
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,250
He would not tolerate.

165
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,250
I don't mind many things, I say, "All right.

166
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,250
Gradually it will be solved.

167
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,320
Things will be all right."

168
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,010
But what I find, that still there are so many 
Sahaja Yogis who don't really realize the

169
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,000
responsibility that they have.

170
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,620
He carried the cross.

171
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,980
In Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to carry cross.

172
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,390
You have to wear only garlands, but you must 
be worthy of garlands.

173
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,250
Nobody has to suffer.

174
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,670
Everything is made very well for them, paved 
with gold as they say, but only thing you

175
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,620
should know, how to walk on them.

176
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:54,090
So the second point, as I said, that you should 
not have a double personality.

177
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,310
Single dedication.

178
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:05,919
You need not be twenty-four hours in it, you 
have your own families, your own children,

179
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,640
you have own your life.

180
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:15,189
With that, you have to be all the time connected, 
but not to get so much involved, that you

181
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:18,159
harm the collectivity of Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:26,319
Your relations - brothers, sisters, mother, 
father, they're all right, but your main responsibility

183
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,620
is Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,540
Instead of that, you get involved into these 
things, you will definitely harm the collectivity

185
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,460
of Sahaja Yoga and create a politics out of 
it.

186
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,050
The second discipline, is that your relationship 
is only with Sahaja Yogis and with nobody

187
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,460
else.

188
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,870
This is very important.

189
00:17:52,870 --> 00:18:02,180
This is what I have to tell you very clearly 
that nobody is important but Sahaja Yogis.

190
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:08,690
Of course, you have to meet others, you have 
to talk to others, you have to deal with them,

191
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,370
you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, that 
is there, no doubt.

192
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,620
But, you cannot let down a Sahaja Yogi.

193
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:25,290
Among yourself if you have differences, sort 
them out and when you are outside, then you

194
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,910
should appear as one.

195
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,940
If you know the truth, there should be no 
differences.

196
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,480
Why should there be differences?

197
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,920
If there are differences, then you should 
find out that something is wrong with you,

198
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,440
definitely, and what is, is wrong is, that 
you are self-centered or you're worried about

199
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,220
something, which is, which is not Sahaja.

200
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,940
Even to follow my example may be difficult.

201
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,710
Now I have My children and My grandchildren, 
I never telephone to them, never.

202
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:07,809
As it is, I never telephone to them.

203
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,230
I am never bothered.

204
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,630
I see my husband so much worried about them, 
always telephones them.

205
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,240
I never.

206
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,210
Firstly, I know they are all right.

207
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:34,420
Firstly, I know I've done my duty, and I'm 
not going to waste My life only on My children

208
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:42,830
or on My husband or on My family because My 
family is the whole universe.

209
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,720
So you have to expand.

210
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,020
Sahaja Yogis have to expand themselves.

211
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:56,230
If they're just interested in their own family, 
in their own children, in their own properties,

212
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,430
is going to be difficult.

213
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,760
So this self-centeredness has to go.

214
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:10,490
This self-centeredness has to go completely 
and you have to have a very wider vision of

215
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:17,610
life.

216
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:39,640
This is a very big compulsion for us, as Sahaja 
Yogis that we belong to the family of the

217
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,370
universe.

218
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:47,060
So, just like in the marriages now.

219
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:54,130
We started saying, "I don't like, I don't 
want to marry an Indian."

220
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,160
Some Indians say, "I don't want to marry a 
foreigner."

221
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,850
If you are so small-minded, you should not 
ask for marriage.

222
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:13,190
You should not ask me that I should marry 
you because we have to transcend completely,

223
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,660
all these petty ideas about our own religion, 
about our own race, about our own country.

224
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:25,000
If you cannot do it, you are not a Sahaja 
Yogi.

225
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,880
From your heart, you must expand.

226
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,000
That is very important.

227
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:43,340
Thus, the problem in India is of, say, caste 
system, which is - I can't understand.

228
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,040
I've told hundred times that in the Gita, 
it's described that in everybody resides the

229
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
spirit.

230
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,559
So how can you have caste?

231
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,040
But you can have according to your aptitude, 
that's different.

232
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,730
But you cannot have caste according to birth.

233
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:09,670
There's so many examples to prove that, but 
in India we have this curse of caste system.

234
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,550
And in the West, is even worse, is the racialism.

235
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,080
It is such a horrible thing called racialism.

236
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,640
For example, I went to Romania and I saw so 
many Gypsies there.

237
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,680
They're treated just like dogs.

238
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,790
So low they were looked upon.

239
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:35,670
These Gypsies are really nice people, nothing 
wrong with them.

240
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,800
At least their character is good.

241
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:50,040
They have certain principle for their women 
and they lead a good life of morality.

242
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:58,700
They are collective people, but they are treated 
so badly, so shabbily, that even in India,

243
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,240
I won't find that kind of a thing happening.

244
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Racialism.

245
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,900
Now, Romanians have no particular race, as 
such.

246
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:18,220
You cannot say they are Germans or English 
or Anglo-Saxons, nothing.

247
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,970
I was surprised there more than anywhere else.

248
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,340
Also in England, the same thing.

249
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,270
They are treated very badly and these are 
people of great art and very loving.

250
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:37,160
And I was surprised that so many came to our 
program also.

251
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:45,550
So the attention should be on a wider vision 
of life and towards the people who are suffering,

252
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,890
is very important.

253
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:57,171
You must look after the people who are suffering, 
who are in trouble, who need your help, not

254
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:04,800
to make friends with people who will help 
you in money or in any other way but be friendly

255
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,630
with the people who are downtrodden.

256
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,590
We have become Sahaja Yogis to help them to 
come up.

257
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:21,630
We have to do something for them and in Vashi 
I'm starting a center where the poor people

258
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,660
will be treated free.

259
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:36,750
Though we are in the middle, we have to help 
the people who are not enjoying any benefit

260
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,980
of life.

261
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,480
We have to take them to Sahaja Yoga, We have 
to help them in every way that is possible.

262
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:52,340
Now, you must have noticed that in the wedding 
lists, what I have done is to create a balance

263
00:24:52,340 --> 00:25:00,170
between, say, the developing countries and 
the developed countries, to make an proper

264
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,890
exchange.

265
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:09,140
Then I find there are people who are very 
arrogant about it.

266
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:15,049
Now, English girls are supposed to be Christians, 
French girls are supposed to be Christians

267
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:16,450
and so many others.

268
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,210
Christ, who did so much for the downtrodden, 
these people, when they get married, they

269
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:29,429
try to show off and look down upon people, 
they are Sahaja Yogis and now we have turned

270
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:33,600
down all the Christian girls from England 
because for the same reason.

271
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:44,090
A funny type of a superiority complex if you 
develop, that's not being Christian at all.

272
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,910
And that's why we have to understand, as Sahaja 
Yogis, that the one of the principle of Sahaja

273
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:56,860
Yoga is that you should get over all these 
minor things and all these limitations from

274
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:07,110
which we have been suffering and others have 
been suffering.

275
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:13,679
When we come to this collective happening, 
we have to understand that people have to

276
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,809
be collective.

277
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,130
Because we should have big palaces where we 
can go and meditate or should we have huge

278
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,130
things?

279
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,380
Not necessary.

280
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:31,940
To pray and to meditate, any place is all 
right.

281
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,890
Anywhere you are there, you can enjoy, you 
should enjoy there.

282
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,170
You should not demand things.

283
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,760
Like when you come to Ganapatipule, I know 
it's not very comfortable.

284
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:52,490
It's not even a three star hotel arrangement, 
but you enjoy each other and you love each

285
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:59,590
other, and the company of every one of you 
is the comfort giving.

286
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:12,059
What gives you comfort is the love, affection, 
oneness, the unity between yourself.

287
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,530
Then you don't care, you don't care what comforts 
you have, what happiness you have.

288
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:26,530
This time, suddenly, you know, there were 
250 more came than expected, so we had to

289
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:32,210
put the, these temporary things for you and 
you didn't mind.

290
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,510
I am very thankful to you for that.

291
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:44,460
So complete tolerance and comfort of the body 
is not important - comfort of the spirit.

292
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:53,130
If your body wants comfort, you try to make 
it learn to give up that.

293
00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:05,520
Try to make your body your slave and not you 
the slave of the body.

294
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,610
This if you don't try, then in Sahaja Yoga, 
you are nowhere because then you will again

295
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:17,390
say, "I must have a beautiful car, then must 
I have a house, then I must have this, must

296
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,390
have that."

297
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:27,419
If you care for your body too much, then the 
spirit, the light of the spirit goes down.

298
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:36,370
There's no glow on your face and there's no 
peace in your mind because, all the time,

299
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,650
you're worried about your body, about your 
comforts, about your food, about this, about

300
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,650
that.

301
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:51,309
You can leave all these things to the Divine.

302
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:57,250
What you have to do to see yourself, that 
in your behavior, you should be honest, you

303
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,559
should be spiritual and you should be surrendering.

304
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,470
That's your job.

305
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,950
You have to see, "Am I surrendering or not?

306
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,169
Am I fully with Sahaja Yoga or not?

307
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:13,580
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

308
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,790
What I should do for Sahaja Yoga?"

309
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,110
If you don't do this way, the mind will work 
the other way round.

310
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,929
It will start thinking, "Oh, this is not good 
for my child.

311
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,080
That's not good.

312
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,220
This is this."

313
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,870
Once you start thinking what have I to do 
for Sahaja Yoga?

314
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,810
What have I to work out for Sahaja Yoga?

315
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:36,510
How I have to spread Sahaja Yoga?, you'll 
be surprised your mind will get into the aura

316
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:45,840
of spirituality and nobody has to tell you 
anything, it will just work automatically.

317
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,470
You have the power, you have everything, you 
have the fountain, which has to be opened

318
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,470
out.

319
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,140
So we come to another point that we should 
realize what we are.

320
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,110
This is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,500
Christ has said, "I am the Son of God."

322
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
All right.

323
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:16,440
He said it openly, though people crucified 
Him for that, but He said it.

324
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,900
He said it openly, "I am the Son of God.

325
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,220
Do what you like."

326
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,670
Which was a fact, which was the truth He was 
supposed to say.

327
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:36,410
So now, the Sahaj Yogis have to say, "I am 
the son or daughter of Adi Shakti."

328
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:48,919
Once you say to yourself that, suddenly you'll 
start changing because it's a very big position.

329
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:55,520
It's a very anointed position.

330
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,240
Once you start saying that, then you'll start 
understanding what is your responsibility.

331
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,590
You'll be amazed.

332
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,919
Those people have been to wrong gurus, when 
they come to Sahaja Yoga, they become extremely

333
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,770
generous and extremely dedicated, extremely 
humble because they have suffered so much.

334
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:23,340
Sometimes, those who come directly do not 
have that feeling.

335
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,980
What you have got, you know better when you 
have gone through some ordeals, but if you

336
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,680
get it Sahaja, then they don't understand.

337
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,450
So, we have to also introspect all the time.

338
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:47,570
The first introspection is that, Am I humble?

339
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,070
Can I humble down myself before anyone?

340
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,299
That's very important, but temper is the worst 
thing.

341
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,890
Krishna has said, "From the temper, everything 
bad starts."

342
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:09,230
Temper starts from liver; so you can cure 
your liver.

343
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:16,480
But temper you can see yourself, how your 
temper is bad and how you want to get rid

344
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,240
of the temper.

345
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,030
Temper will kill all the collectivity.

346
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,970
Temper will blur all the beauty of spirituality.

347
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:35,630
A person who is very hot tempered and talks 
of God, people will say, "Let's run away from

348
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,630
this man."

349
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,620
So the temper you have to get rid of.

350
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:46,620
It's very important to introspect on what 
points you get angry.

351
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,580
Some people think it's a matter of right for 
them to get angry.

352
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:56,269
All right, but not in Sahaj Yoga.

353
00:32:56,269 --> 00:32:58,260
You don't have to get angry.

354
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,280
You don't have to shout at anyone.

355
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,940
You don't have to beat anyone.

356
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
If there is any problem, you can tell Me.

357
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:12,799
But I have seen people fighting, quarrelling 
sometime and I'm amazed how these people are

358
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,780
quarrelling among themselves.

359
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:22,610
Gradually, I'm sure, as you'll grow in spirituality, 
all these fights and quarrels and what you

360
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,660
call the different grouping ideas will drop 
out.

361
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:35,680
But Sahaja Yoga will not allow you to stay 
in it.

362
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,270
You'll be exposed immediately.

363
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,260
People will know about you.

364
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:47,549
So try to understand why you get angry, why 
you have temper, what is the reason, what

365
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,770
you don't like in other people may be within 
you.

366
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,049
Same thing may be existing within you.

367
00:33:54,049 --> 00:34:00,570
So, is a cleansing process in Sahaja Yoga, 
which is very important and we need the help

368
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,380
of Christ very much.

369
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:09,079
Because there is rationality that covers your 
Agnya.

370
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,109
You can rationalize everything.

371
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:13,109
Everything.

372
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:18,359
Even if you kill somebody, you can rationalize 
it.

373
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,830
So this Agnya is also our enemy if we cannot 
keep it open.

374
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,830
Absolutely.

375
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,409
Because we can justify ourself.

376
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:32,590
We can say, "What can I do?

377
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,030
It happened like that and this thing."

378
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,599
Once you start, get after yourself; all these 
things will go away.

379
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:50,950
If you're getting angry very much, stand before 
the mirror and try to get angry with yourself.

380
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:56,780
Then attachments.

381
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,710
Attachments are very subtle.

382
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:07,280
Formerly, what I had known about the western 
Sahaja Yogis, they didn't love their children

383
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,490
very well.

384
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,835
Now, I find they're glued to their children.

385
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:17,890
And they want to move the whole movement of 
Sahaja Yoga according to the whims of their

386
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,910
children.

387
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:26,020
Also, Indian Sahaja Yogis are like that.

388
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,300
They're very attached to their children.

389
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,230
They are, they have been always very attached 
to their children.

390
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,780
I've already explained to you that attachment 
is the death of love.

391
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:44,520
If you love somebody, then love everyone according 
to the need of that person.

392
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,590
You have to move.

393
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,520
You cannot just stick into one point.

394
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,950
That is not your responsibility.

395
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:58,869
That is the responsibility of the Divine and 
leave it to Divine and you will see.

396
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:03,849
Your children will improve, your relationships 
will improve, everything will improve because

397
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:06,670
it's not your responsibility.

398
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:18,470
Your limitations will affect all these relations 
and I should actually say that this limited

399
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:22,790
relationship will, might, also suffocate the 
relations.

400
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:34,660
So I have a very wider vision and a wider 
understanding how far you are.

401
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,460
If you come in the nature, you can learn it 
very well.

402
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,650
See the water.

403
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,300
It's coming to all the trees.

404
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,300
Everyone is blessed.

405
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,180
It doesn't stick to any, any one tree or anywhere.

406
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,180
If it does that, the whole thing will be finished.

407
00:36:52,180 --> 00:37:01,940
If you have to think of collectivity, you 
have to be very much detached and not driven

408
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:12,550
or persuaded into some sort of a small little 
relationships.

409
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:20,430
It's much easier for you to follow Sahaja 
Yoga than anybody else in the world could

410
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:27,270
have followed because others were not realized 
souls.

411
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:34,599
You are all realized souls.

412
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:42,000
There are other attachments - attachments 
to money.

413
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:54,450
Very surprising, like they treat Sahaja Yoga 
sometimes like a shop or a market.

414
00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:01,260
So they'll say, "Mother, can You make it half 
rate?

415
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,619
Can You make it quarter rate?

416
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:08,130
Can You give us some concession?

417
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,580
Some sale, you know."

418
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,920
There are at least thirty-five percent people 
are coming free.

419
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:28,550
And those who can pay want to have half, less 
than half, but I don't know what to say to

420
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,550
them.

421
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:37,470
I mean this is the only chance where you can 
really give some money, which is, of course,

422
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,859
shared, I agree.

423
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:44,410
It's not all that money is needed for one 
person, but you can share, very easily with

424
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,940
others, because they don't have that much 
money to come to this country, they don't

425
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,770
have that much money to live here.

426
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:58,840
As we are talking about global life, we have 
to understand that we have to share money

427
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,000
with them.

428
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,580
If you start understanding only this much, 
I tell you, your attachment to money will

429
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,580
go away.

430
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:11,290
That you have to share.

431
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,430
You don't want to share anything.

432
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,670
You may have crores, but you don't want to 
share.

433
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:23,770
In Sahaja Yoga, so many people have become 
very rich, but they don't want to share.

434
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,500
I'm not saying that we are here for money 
or anything, but main point is, fundamental

435
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,880
point, is the attitude should be of sharing 
with others.

436
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,970
Sahaja Yoga has given us so much.

437
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,349
What have we done for it?

438
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,380
Where are we sharing?

439
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,580
On the other side, we have people who are 
very - very greedy who want more.

440
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:56,530
There are some people who go on borrowing 
money, some people who go on using people

441
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,850
for their own purposes.

442
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,580
All these petty, nonsensical things are not 
for Sahaja Yogis.

443
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
You don't need.

444
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,480
Whatever you need, you just ask, you'll get 
it.

445
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,720
So some people are trying to exploit some 
people and some people are trying to save

446
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,240
themselves.

447
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,360
There should be an open mind.

448
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:33,010
As your Sahasrara is open here - you know, 
this is the Heart Chakra here and this Heart

449
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,820
Chakra opens, then the Sahasrara opens.

450
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:44,000
Open your hearts, open your hearts, then only 
you can enjoy yourself.

451
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,599
Now supposing I want to see something with 
My eyes and My eyes are closed, can I see

452
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
something and enjoy that?

453
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,869
If you have to feel something from your heart, 
your heart is closed, how can you?

454
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:02,840
How can you feel that?

455
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,980
So open your heart.

456
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,240
Open your heart.

457
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:16,080
In this way, you'll realize that things are 
not so difficult.

458
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,090
It's all for us very easy, but we have to 
open our heart and respect each other.

459
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,940
Sahaja Yogis must respect each other.

460
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:35,280
Somebody is black, somebody is white, somebody 
is tall, somebody is short, somebody is like

461
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
that.

462
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,030
God has made a variety otherwise we would 
all have been like a regimentation.

463
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:50,140
So we should enjoy the variety that makes 
the beauty, beauty of creation.

464
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:57,940
So all these outward things should not in 
any way impress you.

465
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:05,880
People should be clean, neat, tidy - that's 
different.

466
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,520
But everybody should be like you is wrong.

467
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:18,030
In India especially, if you speak English 
not very correctly, then he is condemned,

468
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:23,890
as a scheduled caste.

469
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,560
It's such slavish mentality, very slavish.

470
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,880
Whether you know your language or not, your 
mother tongue or not, Hindi or not, doesn't

471
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,880
matter.

472
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
You must know English.

473
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,369
If somebody says "English", he is finished.

474
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:47,470
Well, I have seen Japanese, Chinese, French, 
anyone else speaks horrible, I mean funny

475
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:57,970
English, I should say, but the worst are the 
English themselves.

476
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:03,600
English have lost the sense of English completely, 
but what's so much in that?

477
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:10,540
It's nothing but a slavish mentality to one 
regime, which was here for three hundred years

478
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:21,349
and did nothing good to themselves, went empty 
handed from here.

479
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,890
Even the Christians in India believe that 
Christ was born in England, do you believe

480
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,890
that?

481
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,890
Most of them.

482
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:41,220
So the essence of a life is to be proud of 
whatever country we are born of, we must love

483
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,920
our own country, but we should not identify 
with it.

484
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,930
All the wrongs of that country we should criticize 
and we should see.

485
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,420
We should not accept them and should not become 
a part and parcel of those absurd people who

486
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,599
have their limitations.

487
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,240
Do you transcend your countries?

488
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,890
You transcend all these limitations.

489
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,440
You have become great now.

490
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,480
How can you remain in a small little pond?

491
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
You need an ocean.

492
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,190
You'll get suffocated.

493
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:28,510
Another thing is, you should not use things 
made by machine so much.

494
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:33,770
Try to avoid, as far as possible.

495
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:37,520
These machines have created so many problems 
for us.

496
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:46,690
We should wear something that is made by hand 
or by people who are using small, little,

497
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:53,560
sort of, we can call, ordinary machines, which 
does not require so much of smoke to come

498
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,580
out.

499
00:44:54,580 --> 00:45:00,099
We should be very conscious of ecological 
problems as Sahaja Yogis.

500
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:06,010
But one thing I know, where there are Sahaja 
Yogis the ecological problems also gets solved

501
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,700
because of vibrations.

502
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,760
But vibrations will only fight when you are 
willing to fight ecology.

503
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:21,060
Everywhere you go, you find so much of pollution, 
so much of pollution.

504
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,750
How to fight this pollution?

505
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:31,330
Is to be paying attention to the ecology.

506
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:34,140
Are we producing all those things, which is 
spoiling the atmosphere?

507
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,470
We are responsible, we have to do it.

508
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:44,660
Who is going to do it?

509
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:52,580
So one side, as I told you, we have to look 
after the people who are poorer than us, who

510
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,580
are unfortunate.

511
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:59,451
We have to look after the atmosphere which 
is filled with all nonsensical things and

512
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:11,170
take to a lifestyle, which lifestyle will 
be simpler, by which we don't use so many,

513
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:18,070
so many vehicles and so many things which 
are creating problems.

514
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:25,200
Like in Dehra Dhun they told me they have 
so many of these three-wheelers that the buses

515
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,200
have stopped.

516
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Why?

517
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,290
Because in the three-wheeler you pay some 
money less, so they go by the three-wheeler

518
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:39,330
and it creates all the black soot all over.

519
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,750
A Sahaja Yogi should never sit in a three-wheeler 
to save some money.

520
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:50,160
It's better to walk or use a vehicle which 
doesn't give much of these things.

521
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:59,339
They are so many ways by which we can really 
be very supportive of this ecological problem

522
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,839
because it is a part of our, part of our responsibility.

523
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:16,640
Till the age of forty-seven, I was wearing 
only pure khadi, pure khadi, not even silk,

524
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,220
till the age of forty-seven.

525
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:28,530
Then when this Sahasrara was broken, then 
I started wearing other clothes.

526
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:35,730
Our life should be such that we should feel 
sensitive to every growth around us.

527
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:43,060
It is only our attention, how you put your 
attention to things.

528
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:50,570
Like now, there are so many new things are 
coming up in India, everywhere.

529
00:47:50,570 --> 00:48:00,140
One day, I told somebody that why didn't you 
get some quails from Germany?

530
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,570
He said, "I don't know.

531
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,570
There is quail in Germany?"

532
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,570
I said, "There is a big industry of quails.

533
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,570
What do you say?"

534
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:06,560
"How do you know, Mother?"

535
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,470
I said, "I know."

536
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:16,070
Once I go to a country, I know everything 
about that, all the details about it.

537
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:23,780
I was surprised that such a big industry they 
had, they never knew they had quails.

538
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,670
In the same way, in our own country, we don't 
know what we have, what artistic things we

539
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:34,589
have, what is, what is the one that is, that 
will help the poor.

540
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:38,700
We never know about it.

541
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:49,280
Why Christ was born in those conditions because 
He wanted to give blessings to those poor

542
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,849
people, to help them with spirituality.

543
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,620
But we are not bothered, we are not bothered 
to see where the poverty is and how we can

544
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,930
help.

545
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,630
You can, by all means, you can help them in 
every corner, in every way.

546
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:15,410
It's very simple to understand about your 
own country, where the problem is, why people

547
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:20,560
are poor and we cannot help them.

548
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,109
We have to take to this.

549
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:28,829
Unless and until your light shines in the 
society, we are doing nothing.

550
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:34,230
We are just enjoying our own Sahaja Yoga, 
Ganapatipule and all that.

551
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,360
But what about others?

552
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:43,720
So sensitivity to art, sensitivity to music, 
sensitivity to all creative things that are

553
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:52,300
there and what can we do with these creative 
things for others.

554
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:58,060
The attention should be more towards these 
things than about useless things.

555
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,420
Politics you shouldn't worry so much.

556
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,450
It will be all exposed and finished and it 
will be alright.

557
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,940
Let them fight, let them do what they like.

558
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,380
They're stupid people.

559
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:18,170
Your attention should be how you can be creative, 
how you can help people, how what you can

560
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,170
do.

561
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:28,260
In everything there's one thing - is Love, 
what you call is compassion, Anukampa, just

562
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:34,820
out of love and affection and that should 
be an real innate expression of every Sahaja

563
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,680
Yogi in every field of life.

564
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,420
I don't like this, I don't like that, this 
kind of a person is never a Sahaja Yogi.

565
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:45,470
The one who says, "I like."

566
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:52,190
My throat was not all right, but somebody 
brought some fruit.

567
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,660
Just to please, I ate it.

568
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:03,360
Doesn't matter what, little bit, I did eat.

569
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:07,710
Just to please you, I wore such a heavy saree.

570
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,190
None of you can wear it, I can tell you.

571
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,300
Just to please you.

572
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,079
So what are we doing to please others?

573
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,500
You should be a pleasing personality.

574
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,350
Instead of thinking about how you should be 
pleased, I don't like this, I don't do like

575
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:26,280
that, instead of, what have I done to please 
others?

576
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:38,849
To please the Divine, our character, our behavior 
should be absolutely clean.

577
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:44,280
I know Sahaja Yogis have done wonders and 
they are doing very well, but they can do

578
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,470
much, much, much more than what they are doing.

579
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:53,480
So on this day of Christ's birthday, I have 
to tell you that it is not possible to follow

580
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,150
His life, I agree.

581
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,150
Very difficult.

582
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:05,910
But at least, one has to learn from Him that 
He is before us and let us try to go forward

583
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:13,050
towards Him, in His simplicity, in His honesty 
and the sacrifices He could make.

584
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,050
May God bless you.
