00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,040
Shri Adi Shakti Puja
23rd June, 2002

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,040
Cabella Ligure, Italy 

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:19,600
Today it's a different day altogether for
all of you, because this is the Puja of Adi

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,849
Shakti.

5
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:36,000
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,
it's not only the left side that you know.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:48,550
You all know only the left side, from Shri
Ganesha through the ascent of different, different

7
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,420
chakras on the left side.

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:00,489
I didn't want to tell you about the right
side to begin with, because those who have

9
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:10,850
gone through the right side got just lost.

10
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:25,410
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings
but they didn't know what it was about, they

11
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,840
just used to learn it by heart.

12
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:41,770
They didn't also know the real meaning of
it, and that is how they moved on the right

13
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:55,520
side and, I don’t know, they landed up at
the Agnya; and then they were trying for the

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,659
Self-realization.

15
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:08,379
They were promised that if you do this right
side properly, you will reach to the ultimate

16
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,959
goal of Self-realization.

17
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,219
But none of them reached there.

18
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:26,049
Most of them got into a terrible temper, terrible
temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

19
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:35,870
All these things they learnt through their
right-side movement.

20
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:47,650
There was no kundalini awakening, and they
were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya

21
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:59,450
Chakra, and then they collapsed into different
places of complete ignorance.

22
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:14,620
All these books were written without understanding
that it's not easy to go via right side, but

23
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,099
best was to awaken your kundalini.

24
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:28,549
The kundalini directly takes you up in the
center of all the chakras, up to the Agnya

25
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:38,529
and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya into
the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through

26
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,379
the Sahasrara.

27
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:47,449
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra,
from where it pierces?

28
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,519
I never told you about it.

29
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,589
But now I think for most of you the time has
come.

30
00:03:56,589 --> 00:04:07,230
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating

31
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,699
always.

32
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:19,080
It is pulsating because the spirit entered
through that area, and when you close it,

33
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,150
it settles in the heart.

34
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:35,620
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented
person, but how to enter into the Sahasrara

35
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,290
was the problem.

36
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,680
The tantrikas who were there, they went through
the right, left side, and they developed all

37
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:55,740
the practices of black – we should say,
the left side.

38
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:06,870
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered,
extremely hot-tempered, I should say, extremely

39
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:18,000
ambitious, ferocious, and they started killing
people on the basis of cursing.

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,720
They are very good at cursing people; to be
always forward, push back all the people,

41
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,210
and override everybody's rights.

42
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,770
They were regarded as the most ambitious and
most powerful people.

43
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:50,680
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,
they then took the right side.

44
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,540
Because of the right side they became very
powerful, no doubt.

45
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:07,830
They got all the powers over the world and
they were regarded as extremely powerful and

46
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,210
majestic people, but they were not, because
they were so hot-tempered.

47
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,940
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

48
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,360
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality,
don't worry, keep moving,” and the seven

49
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,300
chakras were described, on the right side.

50
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,500
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

51
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,810
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

52
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,781
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can
call it antariksha.

53
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:59,830
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption

54
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:09,530
inside, is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

55
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:20,460
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

56
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:32,020
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

57
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:44,180
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,
go to the people – janah.

58
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,389
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

59
00:07:49,389 --> 00:08:06,310
In tapah we have Christ in the center; left
side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

60
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:19,669
They were not actually ascending path, they
were just side outlets, we can say, for the

61
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:28,240
energy of people who were trying to seek the
truth.

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,659
Now this happened for ages in India.

63
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,779
All the gurus, all the sadhus, all the big
tapassvis, all of them did this.

64
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,579
But where did they reach?

65
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:56,360
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses
– kshu, shapah – to people, they could

66
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,160
curse somebody.

67
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:08,100
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the
eye they could kill somebody, they could burn

68
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,480
something; all right-sided powers they had.

69
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,100
And with these right-sided powers, where did
they reach?

70
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,360
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not,
in the limbo, as you call it.

71
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,230
There nobody got Self-realization.

72
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:45,890
You read the old books from India, but even
otherwise the Greeks; and then we had Egyptians,

73
00:09:45,890 --> 00:10:02,589
English and all kinds of aggressive people,
Germans – all of them were aggressive – Catholics,

74
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,149
and also you had Romans.

75
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:16,450
All of them were aggressive, and were taking
the land and property of other countries;

76
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:27,850
extremely aggressive, they believed in the
killing of the people – extremely, insulting,

77
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,290
hot-tempered people.

78
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:40,009
So how to bring them to the normal, to the
central path?

79
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:52,680
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv,
swaha, swadha, it’s consumption – this

80
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,380
was done by Guru Principle.

81
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,040
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

82
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,499
They became collective, no doubt, because
they were so powerful that they had such a

83
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:15,149
lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

84
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:25,610
With their oppressive temperament they were
fighting on people and were oppressing them.

85
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:34,250
All this kind of … generation came in the
history, as you know, and then it disappeared.

86
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:45,000
Wars were created, then so many people were
killed.

87
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,720
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

88
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,730
They never cared for humanity.

89
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,660
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

90
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:11,769
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they
destroyed Jesus Christ.

91
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:18,860
They destroyed so many great saints who were
really saints through the central path – some

92
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,680
were incarnations – and they destroyed them.

93
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:34,170
All this happened since the time of Rama,
all that has happened.

94
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:43,389
And one after another so many rakshasas came,
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of

95
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:55,279
the world; extremely arrogant show-offs, as
we can call them, very aggressive people.

96
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:10,230
And this aggression came, came with such a
great force, and followed one after another.

97
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:16,310
It went up to a point.

98
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:30,610
When people reacted, they were killed and
were destroyed.

99
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:57,079
So horrible people were created; all these
people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

100
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:09,149
This nature is still within us, some people,
because they are right-sided.

101
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:21,269
All right-side people had this problem: temper,
aggression, controlling others.

102
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:28,230
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual
growth.

103
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:39,249
They wanted to have spirituality, but with
this kind of behavior they had developed,

104
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,149
spirituality ran away.

105
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:47,180
We had so many incarnations.

106
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,980
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

107
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:05,180
There was no possibility of saving human beings
in general.

108
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,300
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

109
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:17,370
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,
all the countries, all the nations, and we

110
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,870
were all finished.

111
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:29,630
All this is because we have taken to right-sided
movement which they thought was easier for

112
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,059
spirituality, which was not.

113
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:44,320
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached
a stage that they became absolutely devils,

114
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:54,209
rakshasas, without realizing that human beings
are rakshasas, that's what they become.

115
00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:07,550
Even their gurus were like that, and nothing
but they tortured even the incarnations, all

116
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,829
the incarnations were tortured by them.

117
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:22,339
It was really – how they saved themselves
is remarkable, but ultimately they couldn't

118
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,079
produce any results.

119
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:36,670
So the first thing I tried was to study about
the kundalini, that I should be able to raise

120
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,670
the kundalini.

121
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:46,079
And I knew I had come for that, not for anything
else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

122
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:54,040
so that they take to the central path, not
to the right or to the left.

123
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,869
But I told you the knowledge of the left side,
plus raising your kundalini.

124
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:17,090
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,
and you entered into the realm of real joy,

125
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,579
of reality.

126
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:27,560
All these bad qualities started falling out.

127
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,350
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

128
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:41,330
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the
central path, you became very pure people.

129
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:50,280
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness
went away, your cheapness went away and you

130
00:17:50,280 --> 00:18:01,150
became very, very – I think we should call
them the holy people.

131
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,280
Unless and until that happens you cannot be
in Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:13,200
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be
a flirtish, you cannot be a man who wants

133
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,600
to grab money from others and all that, or
anyone who is very aggressive could be in

134
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,770
Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,550
So all such people were thrown out.

136
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,860
Once they were thrown out they were showing
their teeth, I should say.

137
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,690
They didn't like it that they were thrown
out.

138
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,870
But they understand now, some of them, that
“we have made mistakes.”

139
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:50,200
So first thing is that you must develop your
sense of chastity, respect it and enjoy it.

140
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,350
That happened because of your Mooladhara being
awakened.

141
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:05,210
That's the first chakra on the left side,
where you have Shri Ganesha.

142
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,850
But on the right side also we have deities.

143
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:20,170
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

144
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:30,480
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful
purity, and we started understanding the beauty

145
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,240
of purity, the power of purity.

146
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,630
That's how our right side we finished off.

147
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,940
Right side was for fighting, for killing,
anger.

148
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,700
There was no peace for these people.

149
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:04,200
The only thing they knew how to dominate others,
and to be intolerable.

150
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:13,830
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level
of Swadisthan.

151
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,680
In Swadisthana they rose, and the aggressiveness
of the creative people to create something.

152
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,000
Even now we have many.

153
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,020
They create all kinds of nonsense, create
all sorts of grotesque, also very, very, I

154
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:43,900
should say, dirty things to make a name.

155
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:51,510
So this is the another thing we got it in
Swadisthana, people who wanted to have a name,

156
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,890
a position – that came from right Swadisthana.

157
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:04,910
Then the third chakra that was there was the
Nabhi Chakra.

158
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:13,360
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make
money, not Lakshmi but money, money by any

159
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,190
means, and they cheated the whole world.

160
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:28,770
With this money that they got, they did all
kinds of bad things.

161
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:37,380
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

162
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:47,810
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries
like India, and aggressiveness in the right-side

163
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,110
countries.

164
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:57,960
In the center, what quality we have at the
Swadisthana is the creativeness: creative

165
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:08,970
of art, which is very beautiful, which is
very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

166
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:18,220
That vanished, and people started showing
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

167
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,940
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

168
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,880
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

169
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:37,830
In Nabhi people got after money.

170
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,840
Left-sided people were making money, right-sided
were aggressive with their money.

171
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,570
If they were earning they thought they’re
on top of the world.

172
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,710
If they had money they thought, “Nobody
is better than us.”

173
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,500
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

174
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:04,650
It will come to that point where they will
realize that money is not for destroying but

175
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:11,610
for construction: constructing of the country,
constructing of the human beings together

176
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:23,880
to bring peace and love among them, for helping,
for doing all kinds of good things.

177
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:38,790
Then the same right-sided people went to the
chakra of the Mother, and they were horrible

178
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:46,350
mothers, tried to dominate their children,
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice

179
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,640
anything for the children.

180
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,730
We have had enough of these women who are
aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive

181
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,120
with their children.

182
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,640
And even the motherhood among men is dead
and finished.

183
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,980
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth
I saw, and I was shocked – what sort of

184
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,420
human beings are those?

185
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,980
What am I going to do with them?

186
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,310
How will I awaken their kundalini?

187
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:27,960
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost, but
now it is the Mother's chakra.

188
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,710
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they
drove out their children – very selfish,

189
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,950
self-centered, dominating parents.

190
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:49,830
This was the Heart Chakra.

191
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,350
Then came the collective chakra, what we call
as the Vishuddhi.

192
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:00,830
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy
the whole world.

193
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:12,460
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their
own to become emperors, and they formed empires

194
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,610
and misbehaved to such an extent that it's
not humanly possible to behave like that.

195
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,580
They really were rakshasas, I should say,
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

196
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:31,170
In their behavior, in everything you can see
how they behave towards people, treating them

197
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:43,740
like that, creating people who are against
spirituality, and those who are aggressive.

198
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:55,510
Well, these became like a two-sided world
where there are people who are aggressive,

199
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,670
and the people who are tortured.

200
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:09,280
This two-sided world exists even now, but
is much less.

201
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:18,200
Thanks to the collective understanding there
are many good institution that were established

202
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,270
but they are not working out, they are not
so successful, because the men at the head

203
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:29,230
of it are controlling, but controlling what?

204
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:36,270
Not themselves – controlling others, and
all their behavior has spoilt all the work

205
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,930
of this chakra.

206
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:48,160
Collectively you have, if you see around now
today everywhere there’s war going on, fights

207
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,450
going on, killing going on, destruction going
on.

208
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,400
How is it?

209
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:02,230
There are so many spiritual people here now
on this world.

210
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:08,350
So the reason is, the spiritual people have
become very quiet, very much enjoying their

211
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:17,190
spiritual life, have become very quiet and
very peaceful people.

212
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,840
But that doesn't bring peace.

213
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,610
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring
peace in the world, you have to do something

214
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,160
about it.

215
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,870
We are very much satisfied with our progress,
but we are not bothered as to see what is

216
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:40,390
the progress others have done, how far they
have gone, where can we meet them, what can

217
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,000
we change them.

218
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,670
At My level I can change many things, but
at your level how many people have you changed?

219
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,160
What have you done?

220
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,620
That has to be said.

221
00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:00,130
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,
and you are very happy with your peace, with

222
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,540
everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

223
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,740
This is the biggest calamity that the world
is facing today, that those who are all so

224
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:14,960
spiritual, those who have achieved great heights
are least bothered as to what good has to

225
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,410
be done.

226
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:22,760
What they are doing is to enjoy their own
spirituality, come to the puja, have more

227
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,430
and more of it.

228
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:31,180
But they have done no collective work to change
people.

229
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,250
Some of them are working, one or two, but
the rest of them are having a good time enjoying

230
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:46,500
themselves in such a manner that people accept
them as great souls, good people, that's all.

231
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,930
I would like you to now introspect and find
out how much collective work you have done,

232
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,090
how many people you have got – like that.

233
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,160
With whom are you talking?

234
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,690
How many people have you told about Sahaja
Yoga?

235
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,830
Only so many are there.

236
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:12,430
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were
much more dynamic than you are.

237
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,410
So now you should take to the right side.

238
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:23,090
And when you take to the right side we'll
create dynamic people, not just some useless,

239
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:29,600
patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

240
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,860
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,980
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change
so many.

242
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,670
And those who are doing that, all My blessings
are with them.

243
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,810
But those who are just keeping to themselves,
it is not a very good thing.

244
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,620
In your country how many people have got to
Sahaja Yoga?

245
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,680
Just find out.

246
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,930
With how many people you have worked it out?

247
00:29:54,930 --> 00:30:00,200
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is
a partial yoga of the left side, where you

248
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,070
are very loving, you are very kind, very this
thing.

249
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,200
I am not saying that you should become aggressive
in any way.

250
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,110
But even I have seen people want to be leaders,
they want to be something great; but how many

251
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,800
people have they given realization?

252
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,930
How many people have they talked about Sahaja
Yoga?

253
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:24,940
I have said even in the aeroplane also you
go, you walk in the street, anywhere people

254
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,480
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

255
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:35,640
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our
greatness, for our understanding of ourselves.

256
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,460
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought
to you.

257
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:47,750
It has been brought to you for giving realizations
to many people.

258
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,440
I request all the younger people, younger
generation not to waste their Sahaj energies

259
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,960
on nonsense as the old people have done.

260
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,210
You’d better go ahead and talk to people
about Sahaja Yog, and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,010
They are more interested in running schools,
in looking after the destitute, doing this,

262
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,460
doing that – that's not your job.

263
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,320
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more
Sahaja yoginis.

264
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,170
But that is not there, what I find is it's
not there.

265
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,830
The right side is missing.

266
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,010
You should come to the right side.

267
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,220
Go all ahead.

268
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,570
Nothing will happen to you.

269
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:35,070
Nobody can kill you, nobody can disturb you,
nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

270
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:41,490
You have powers but if you don't use them,
you are like this.

271
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:47,309
That is why we have come to the stagnated
point that we should know we have to use our

272
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:49,170
right side.

273
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,010
Right side is very important.

274
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,070
Next time I'll tell you about right side,
what right-sided things you have.

275
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,520
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever
you may try; so you use your right side in

276
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:14,840
the right direction with the right understanding,
not as some sort of, I should say, very arbitrary

277
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,700
or very dominating, like Hitlers.

278
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,600
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

279
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:30,600
But now the time has come for you to do something
more than what the saints have done before,

280
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,780
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself
that you have a family, you have very nice

281
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,680
children, having, enjoying, all that – that's
not the Sahaja Yoga for.

282
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,180
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole
world.

283
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:56,290
You have to think about it: what are you doing,
where are you, and what have you achieved

284
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,350
out of Sahaja Yoga?

285
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,550
Then we come to the Agnya.

286
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:11,330
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis
are become, they have, they can bear anything,

287
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,490
they can suffer anything – that's not we
want.

288
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:23,150
What we want, to remove the sufferings of
others, remove the aggression of others.

289
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:29,740
So we don't, that kind of organization we
don't have, that kind of understanding we

290
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,590
don’t have.

291
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,460
And if that works out, you will be different
people.

292
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:45,950
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting
in their hermit halls, something like that,

293
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,510
not more than that.

294
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,280
So better try to do something positive, without
aggression.

295
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:01,990
I know some of you are still very aggressive,
are show-offs, I know that.

296
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:12,730
But if you get into the mood of working out
collectively, then you will realize what mistakes

297
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:21,340
you have, still what is lacking in your personality
– that is very important.

298
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:30,119
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,
I don't know what happens to them.

299
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,590
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

300
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,290
But that doesn't mean that you allow people
to do wrong things.

301
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,650
Because you want to forgive it's very easy
not to fight, not to say anything, just keep

302
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,890
out, just forgive – no.

303
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:56,020
You go and talk to that person and tell him
it is wrong.

304
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,560
You have to face it.

305
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,700
If you cannot face it then you are useless,
just like any other people.

306
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,770
What's the use of you people getting your
realization?

307
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:17,980
So now we have to understand that it's not
only that we have vibrations, that we are

308
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:22,320
all right, that you can cure some people is
the last word – no.

309
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,060
You have to spread it, you have to go in the
public, you have to be collective on this

310
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,110
point and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

311
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:38,590
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world
we have not progressed much.

312
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:45,230
So now it is you have to plan what you want
to do, how you want to do it, and how you

313
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,760
want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

314
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,780
It's very important.

315
00:35:51,780 --> 00:36:00,460
Because you people are good at, say, talking
about Sahaja Yoga, singing about Sahaja Yoga;

316
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,780
all these things are useless unless and until
you have concrete proof of getting many more

317
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,010
people in Sahaja Yoga.

318
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:16,310
In a small country like Turkey we have twenty-five
thousand Sahaja yogis – what do you say?

319
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:26,290
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands
Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis, while you find

320
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:34,190
that number is very small in any other country.

321
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,110
They are not very rich, but they care for
their Self-realization and for toward giving

322
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,520
Self-realizations to others.

323
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,860
It's very surprising how it has worked out,
how it has spread.

324
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:56,080
So instead of thinking of your problems, of
your enemies, of your powers, think of giving

325
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,980
power to others and making them Sahaja Yoga
– it's very important.

326
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,740
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all
the powers.

327
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:13,450
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,
what's the use of getting realization?

328
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,350
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

329
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:27,940
So I would say that instead of spreading your
own glory, your own … , your own name, please

330
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,330
try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

331
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,869
Go into a very dynamic force.

332
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:40,890
So many people have complained to Me that
Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

333
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,410
Is that what you are?

334
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:52,090
Only single person like Me has done so much
work, so why not you people?

335
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,789
In your country have you worked it out all
over?

336
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,580
Just think about it.

337
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,880
And that's why, unless and until you don't
do it you are not sampurna, you are not complete,

338
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,010
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood
in its full form.

339
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,700
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very
important day that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

340
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,410
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to
be a complete form.

341
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,720
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

342
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,540
If that doesn't work out, then what's the
use?

343
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:35,870
It's like any other getting any other realization
– that's not so important.

344
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:47,760
Not only that you should spread, but also
you should make them, and realize it.

345
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:57,630
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers
I give you; but try to understand.

346
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,870
All right?

347
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,360
Thank you very much.
