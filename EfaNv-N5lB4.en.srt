00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Shri Adi Shakti Puja 23rd June, 2002 Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,667
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:18,334
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:27,033
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

5
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:34,367
it's not only the left side that you know.

6
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:42,033
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

7
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:51,367
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

8
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:58,133
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

9
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:07,067
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

10
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:19,200
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

11
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:24,000
but they didn't know what it was about,

12
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:31,133
they just used to learn it by heart.

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,067
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

14
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:43,067
and that is how they moved on the right side

15
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,367
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,567
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

17
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:03,067
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

18
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:10,234
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

19
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:14,033
But none of them reached there.

20
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,067
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

21
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:25,067
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,234
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

23
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:38,067
There was no kundalini awakening,

24
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:47,067
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

25
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:55,167
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

26
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:06,767
All these books were written without understanding

27
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,500
that it's not easy to go via right side,

28
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,534
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,033
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

30
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:33,067
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

31
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:40,067
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

32
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:47,167
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

33
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,300
I never told you about it.

34
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:55,300
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

35
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:02,167
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

36
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:07,567
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

37
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,133
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

38
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,267
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

39
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:30,067
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

40
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:37,267
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

41
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,500
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

42
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:53,334
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

43
00:04:55,133 --> 00:05:02,567
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

44
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:08,300
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

45
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:18,467
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

46
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,400
They are very good at cursing people;

47
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
to be always forward, push back all the people,

48
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:32,133
and override everybody's rights.

49
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:39,200
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

50
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:46,300
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

51
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,167
they then took the right side.

52
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:54,133
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

53
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:58,100
They got all the powers over the world

54
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:08,334
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

55
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,601
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

56
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:16,634
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

57
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:22,033
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

58
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:29,434
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

59
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:37,267
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

60
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:42,234
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

61
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:48,567
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

62
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,033
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

63
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,267
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

64
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,167
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

66
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:31,033
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

67
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,367
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

68
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:42,200
go to the people – janah.

69
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,300
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

70
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:55,100
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

71
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:06,033
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

72
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:12,200
They were not actually ascending path,

73
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:18,534
they were just side outlets, we can say,

74
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:25,701
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

75
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,167
Now this happened for ages in India.

76
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:38,200
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

77
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:42,234
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

78
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,067
But where did they reach?

79
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:50,701
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

80
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:56,100
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

81
00:08:57,334 --> 00:09:05,300
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

82
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:11,167
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

83
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:16,667
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

84
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:23,434
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

85
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,234
There nobody got Self-realization.

86
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:39,067
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

87
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:47,534
and then we had Egyptians, English

88
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:55,167
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

89
00:09:55,467 --> 00:10:05,801
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

90
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,601
All of them were aggressive,

91
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:14,701
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

92
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:21,300
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

93
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:28,634
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

94
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:38,200
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

95
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:50,067
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

96
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:55,167
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

97
00:10:56,634 --> 00:11:03,067
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

98
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:07,400
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

99
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:17,367
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

100
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:21,367
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

101
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,300
and were oppressing them.

102
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:30,067
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

103
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:33,200
as you know, and then it disappeared.

104
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:43,234
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

105
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,067
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

106
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:55,067
They never cared for humanity.

107
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,701
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

108
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:10,200
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

109
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:15,067
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

110
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:21,100
through the central path – some were incarnations –

111
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,367
and they destroyed them.

112
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:33,434
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

113
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:39,601
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

114
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,067
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

115
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,367
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

116
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,500
very aggressive people.

117
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:06,400
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

118
00:13:07,534 --> 00:13:10,067
and followed one after another.

119
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,133
It went up to a point.

120
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:24,234
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

121
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:34,200
So horrible people were created;

122
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:56,067
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

123
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:07,367
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

124
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:19,267
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

125
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:26,200
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

126
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,667
They wanted to have spirituality,

127
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:41,601
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

128
00:14:43,234 --> 00:14:46,100
We had so many incarnations.

129
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:51,400
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

130
00:14:53,367 --> 00:15:02,334
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

131
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:07,701
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

132
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:13,000
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

133
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:17,734
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

134
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,567
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

135
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,334
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

136
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:38,033
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

137
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:45,567
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

138
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:50,634
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

139
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,234
that's what they become.

140
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,567
Even their gurus were like that,

141
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:09,234
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

142
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,601
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

143
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,067
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

144
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:24,033
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

145
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:32,567
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

146
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,500
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

147
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,167
And I knew I had come for that,

148
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:45,267
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

149
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,567
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

150
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:59,467
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

151
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:05,434
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

152
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:18,234
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

153
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:25,400
All these bad qualities started falling out.

154
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:30,200
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

155
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:35,334
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

156
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:41,067
you became very pure people.

157
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:46,467
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

158
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:52,000
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

159
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,567
I think we should call them the holy people.

160
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:05,033
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:10,467
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

162
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:16,500
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

163
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,334
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

164
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,300
So all such people were thrown out.

165
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,133
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

166
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,133
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

167
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:37,033
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

168
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:44,434
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

169
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,033
respect it and enjoy it.

170
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,500
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

171
00:18:55,467 --> 00:19:03,267
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

172
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:08,234
But on the right side also we have deities.

173
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:14,234
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

174
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,534
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

175
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:26,267
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

176
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:31,100
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

177
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:34,234
the power of purity.

178
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:42,400
That's how our right side we finished off.

179
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:49,367
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

180
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,534
There was no peace for these people.

181
00:19:55,234 --> 00:20:02,033
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

182
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:12,033
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

183
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,167
In Swadisthana they rose,

184
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:24,200
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

185
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,300
Even now we have many.

186
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,601
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

187
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:42,500
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

188
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,100
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

189
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:52,133
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

190
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,367
that came from right Swadisthana.

191
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,601
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

192
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:08,400
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

193
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:14,300
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

194
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,300
and they cheated the whole world.

195
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:27,000
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

196
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:35,400
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

197
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:43,067
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

198
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:48,567
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

199
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:58,200
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

200
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:02,467
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

201
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:07,500
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

202
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:12,234
That vanished, and people started showing

203
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:16,367
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

204
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:21,567
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

205
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:26,734
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

206
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:35,067
In Nabhi people got after money.

207
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:39,067
Left-sided people were making money,

208
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,601
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

209
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:45,334
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

210
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:50,234
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

211
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:56,734
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

212
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,500
It will come to that point where they will realize

213
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:06,234
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

214
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:11,133
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

215
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,167
to bring peace and love among them,

216
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:21,467
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

217
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:34,334
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

218
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:41,200
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

219
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:48,434
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

220
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,334
We have had enough of these women

221
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:57,234
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

222
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:02,400
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

223
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:09,067
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

224
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,400
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

225
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,100
What am I going to do with them?

226
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:19,133
How will I awaken their kundalini?

227
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:23,133
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

228
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:27,033
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

229
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:32,667
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

230
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:38,400
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

231
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,434
This was the Heart Chakra.

232
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:53,334
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

233
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:59,200
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

234
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:09,400
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

235
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:14,500
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

236
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:18,067
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

237
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,367
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

238
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,434
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

239
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:28,267
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

240
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:33,100
towards people, treating them like that,

241
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:40,400
creating people who are against spirituality,

242
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:44,067
and those who are aggressive.

243
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:49,634
Well, these became like a two-sided world

244
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:54,300
where there are people who are aggressive,

245
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,267
and the people who are tortured.

246
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:07,167
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

247
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:12,267
Thanks to the collective understanding

248
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:17,133
there are many good institution that were established

249
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:22,067
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

250
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,300
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

251
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,567
Not themselves – controlling others,

252
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:37,267
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

253
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:43,067
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

254
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:50,200
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

255
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,567
destruction going on. How is it?

256
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,167
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

257
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,000
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

258
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:09,434
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

259
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:16,067
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

260
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,434
But that doesn't bring peace.

261
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:25,133
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

262
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,200
you have to do something about it.

263
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:30,267
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

264
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:35,534
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

265
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:39,300
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

266
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:41,234
what can we change them.

267
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,801
At My level I can change many things,

268
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,267
but at your level how many people have you changed?

269
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:51,033
What have you done? That has to be said.

270
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:55,267
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

271
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:59,200
and you are very happy with your peace,

272
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:02,133
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

273
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:06,334
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

274
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:11,567
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

275
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,400
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

276
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:19,667
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

277
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:24,067
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

278
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,334
But they have done no collective work to change people.

279
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,300
Some of them are working, one or two,

280
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,167
but the rest of them are having a good time

281
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,067
enjoying themselves in such a manner

282
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:46,367
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

283
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,734
I would like you to now introspect

284
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,133
and find out how much collective work you have done,

285
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,634
how many people you have got – like that.

286
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:00,267
With whom are you talking?

287
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:03,534
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

288
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,067
Only so many are there.

289
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,234
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

290
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:14,300
So now you should take to the right side.

291
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,067
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

292
00:29:19,567 --> 00:29:28,467
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

293
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

294
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:36,467
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

295
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:40,567
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

296
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:45,767
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

297
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:49,734
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

298
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:54,133
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

299
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:59,334
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

300
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:02,534
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

301
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,500
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

302
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,701
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

303
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:15,067
but how many people have they given realization?

304
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:18,634
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

305
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,167
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

306
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,133
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:31,100
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

308
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:35,667
for our understanding of ourselves.

309
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,367
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

310
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:46,167
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

311
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:49,334
I request all the younger people, younger generation

312
00:30:49,367 --> 00:30:53,067
not to waste their Sahaj energies

313
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:55,434
on nonsense as the old people have done.

314
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:59,200
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

315
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,200
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

316
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,200
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

317
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

318
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:14,667
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

319
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:19,234
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

320
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:23,434
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

321
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:30,033
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

322
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,200
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

323
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:39,300
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

324
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:44,601
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

325
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,200
that we should know we have to use our right side.

326
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:51,267
Right side is very important.

327
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:56,434
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

328
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,500
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

329
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:04,400
so you use your right side in the right direction

330
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:11,033
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

331
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:18,434
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

332
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:22,234
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

333
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,334
But now the time has come for you

334
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:29,534
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

335
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:33,434
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

336
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:38,067
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

337
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:41,334
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

338
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:47,634
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

339
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:53,500
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

340
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:58,200
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

341
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,300
Then we come to the Agnya.

342
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:08,734
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

343
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:15,100
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

344
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,500
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

345
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,400
remove the aggression of others.

346
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:27,367
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

347
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,467
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

348
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:35,434
And if that works out, you will be different people.

349
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:42,367
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

350
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:47,234
something like that, not more than that.

351
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:53,634
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

352
00:33:53,801 --> 00:34:00,067
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

353
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:08,567
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

354
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:13,567
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

355
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:20,534
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

356
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:24,567
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

357
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,634
I don't know what happens to them.

358
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,567
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

359
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:37,400
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

360
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,534
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

361
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:45,500
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

362
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:53,634
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

363
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,100
You have to face it.

364
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,267
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

365
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:08,534
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

366
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:15,634
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

367
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:18,100
that we are all right,

368
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,367
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

369
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:26,100
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

370
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
you have to be collective on this point

371
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:30,500
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,200
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

373
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,534
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

374
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:46,267
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:49,567
It's very important.

376
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:58,067
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

377
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:02,534
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

378
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:08,234
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

379
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,500
In a small country like Turkey

380
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,634
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

381
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:24,033
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

382
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,067
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

383
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,367
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

384
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,467
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

385
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:45,367
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

386
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:54,634
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

387
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,267
think of giving power to others

388
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:01,367
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

389
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:06,267
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

390
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,267
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

391
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:12,534
what's the use of getting realization?

392
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:16,400
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

393
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:25,567
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

394
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,667
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

395
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:33,534
Go into a very dynamic force.

396
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,434
So many people have complained to Me

397
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:40,500
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

398
00:37:41,534 --> 00:37:44,334
Is that what you are?

399
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:51,334
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

400
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:55,367
In your country have you worked it out all over?

401
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,634
Just think about it.

402
00:37:58,167 --> 00:38:02,100
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

403
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:03,334
you are not complete,

404
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:08,534
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

405
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,033
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

406
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:15,300
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

407
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,167
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

408
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,634
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

409
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,434
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

410
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:34,300
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

411
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,100
Not only that you should spread,

412
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:41,534
but also you should make them, and realize it.

413
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:54,400
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

414
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:59,534
but try to understand. All right?

415
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,000
Thank you very much.
