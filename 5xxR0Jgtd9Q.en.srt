1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:21,030
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Krishna’s incarnation.

2
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:29,820
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

3
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:40,909
So in every incarnation they carry all their
qualities, all their powers and all their

4
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:45,139
nature with them.

5
00:00:45,139 --> 00:01:00,209
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

6
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:14,290
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their
previous life has been misunderstood and have

7
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,060
been carried to the extremes.

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:47,770
That’s why they have to come back again
and again.

9
00:01:47,770 --> 00:02:01,210
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

10
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,360
is the preserver.

11
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:20,160
He’s the preserver of this creation and
also the preserver of dharma.

12
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:31,650
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma.

13
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:42,100
By keeping the dharma all right only, you
could get your realization.

14
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:51,420
So the job was quite difficult one, I should
say, to keep people in the central path of

15
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,750
Mahalakshmi.

16
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:11,650
So by first incarnation, you can say that,
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

17
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,650
Rama.

18
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,620
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

19
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,840
But as a result of that, people started thinking
if they have become queen and king, born in

20
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:32,140
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

21
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:42,470
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He
was the best among all the human beings.

22
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:51,330
That means He incarnated as a human being,
total human being, showing all the qualities

23
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,560
of human beings.

24
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:07,890
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

25
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,030
married life.

26
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:19,120
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic
to show how a man should lead his life in

27
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
a proper dharma as a married man.

28
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:33,350
And even when the wife has gone away, how
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

29
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,740
And He never had another marriage, though
many people said that “You should have another

30
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,280
marriage."

31
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:54,520
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it.

32
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:03,770
By His life, He showed how a husband should
be with his wife.

33
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,770
But then later on He had another role as the
king.

34
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:16,460
When He became the king then He found out
that people were criticizing Him because He

35
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,310
brought Sita back from Ravana.

36
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,700
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from
Him.

37
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:37,780
How many people in this world, who are in
power, would be that sensible about that power

38
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:46,070
that they have, that they have to behave in
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

39
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,850
other people who are working under them, for
the administration, for looking after the

40
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,700
country?

41
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:06,140
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

42
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:15,520
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people.

43
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,990
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

44
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:31,050
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

45
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:44,670
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

46
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:52,529
So there was no need to have any struggle,
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

47
00:06:52,529 --> 00:07:02,290
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

48
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:11,690
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

49
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,480
should be.

50
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:23,880
As a result of His incarnation – always
people take to something, something which

51
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,260
is not normal.

52
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:37,010
So because He lived as an ascetic people started
following asceticism.

53
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:43,730
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

54
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,920
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

55
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,390
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints
used to marry, they used to have wives they

56
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,690
used to have children, they lived a very normal
life.

57
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:07,980
Only they were saints because they were very
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

58
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:17,150
doing the work of realization and also other
corrections in human beings.

59
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:26,680
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

60
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,350
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic."

61
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:42,159
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled
in and then people became very austere type,

62
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,940
very austere.

63
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:52,339
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

64
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,169
was done in a very dry manner.

65
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:05,260
So many seekers did not marry but apart from
seekers many seers and saints also did not

66
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,159
marry and because they had no balance, because
marriage gives you a balance, they became

67
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:20,109
very dry people, very hot tempered people,
and we have some examples of some rishis who

68
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:29,690
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

69
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,630
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s
called as Bhasma Karoti.

70
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:47,490
So these qualities developed, that is the
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

71
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,400
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

72
00:09:51,400 --> 00:10:04,169
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

73
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:08,089
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called
as Leeladhara.

74
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:14,789
He was the one who showed that everything
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

75
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:25,039
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole
life is a fun.

76
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:33,339
He gave this idea because people had become
so austere.

77
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:42,289
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism
started, like they would not eat, they created

78
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:45,280
a caste system which started developing.

79
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,740
The caste was determined by birth, which was
wrong, and they could not eat food.

80
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,250
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

81
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,870
others.

82
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:20,779
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

83
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:32,620
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

84
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:42,719
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play
was brought forth, and the play was quite

85
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:57,479
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil,
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

86
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:10,759
was
mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother also

87
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,099
of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

88
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:22,789
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,
so it’s all a play of the same.

89
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:32,599
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

90
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:38,510
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all,
just see the drama as it worked out.

91
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:46,750
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was
very powerful and who was a devil.

92
00:12:46,750 --> 00:13:03,019
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

93
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:06,839
He was very young, He was about five years
of age.

94
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:16,000
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

95
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,550
very big snake – a cobra – very well known
cobra.

96
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:29,149
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis
with His power – in a play.

97
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:36,880
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you
must have read the stories about Him – how

98
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,800
He showed that there is no need to have a
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

99
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:52,709
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

100
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,320
But He never used all these outside powers.

101
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:07,199
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used,
to show that there is no need to use any army

102
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:15,019
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

103
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,479
And all was in a very playful manner.

104
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:30,270
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

105
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:39,769
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

106
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,139
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

107
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,529
It’s something like Mahamaya.

108
00:14:48,529 --> 00:15:01,191
But say all the cameras are now giving you
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

109
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,159
She is like.

110
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:10,580
But one may try to show that you don’t remember,
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

111
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:17,560
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

112
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,279
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won’t be able

113
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,370
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll
be such an awe.

114
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:39,060
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person.

115
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,269
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of
butter.

116
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,899
And as you know butter is very good for the
throat.

117
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,529
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times
that on your tea you put some butter and take

118
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,819
it so that your throat which is dried out
will feel better.

119
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:09,639
So He was very fond of butter and He would
go and make His friends help Him, and made

120
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,729
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and
break the butter container and would eat all

121
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,690
that butter like a little baby.

122
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,099
So one day His mother said, “All right,
why did you eat butter?”

123
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,450
He said, “I never ate."

124
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,409
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

125
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,060
He said, “This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

126
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,529
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

127
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,529
to that extent.

128
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,359
Like “don’t tell lies!

129
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:39,359
You must not!”

130
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:42,129
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

131
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:44,180
So He told her a lie.

132
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,149
“See now, these people have put it on my
mouth.

133
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:54,279
They have eaten all the butter and now I am
the one you are catching!” you see.

134
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,070
So she said, “Really?

135
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,359
Open your mouth!”

136
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:06,029
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

137
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,200
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth.

138
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,180
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi,
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

139
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,050
she just bowed to Him.

140
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:22,470
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?”
as if nothing has happened.

141
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:36,400
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

142
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:46,190
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

143
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,290
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

144
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,550
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

145
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:10,830
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

146
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,931
are not attached to their children.

147
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:13,770
They don’t love their children.

148
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:19,590
They love their carpets, love everything else
because they can sell it, but they can’t

149
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,129
sell their children.

150
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:25,710
And that kills the joy.

151
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:35,009
So the children and the parents are separated
by materialistic ideas that this material

152
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,060
is more important than their own children.

153
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,050
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

154
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,330
steal also.

155
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,080
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

156
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,070
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal,
is bad.

157
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,290
But He was stealing only the butter of His
mother that He had made them.

158
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:03,729
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

159
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:11,220
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

160
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,040
very powerful.

161
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,300
So He thought best thing is to go and eat
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

162
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,719
be able to go and sell it.

163
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:29,310
Also if you see it significantly is this that
we starve our children, we starve our families,

164
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,070
just to have some money.

165
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,650
Money orientation is there, that you can go
and sell your butter to somebody.

166
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,530
With this idea – everything to be sold out,
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

167
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,080
out that.

168
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,020
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

169
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:57,440
So the children are the only permanent liabilities,
so the children are treated as if they are

170
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,719
just burdens while all other things are good
because you can sell it.

171
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:08,820
So the whole value system, if it runs down
to money, then children have no place in the

172
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,610
family.

173
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:22,139
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

174
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,970
and they are to be looked after that way.

175
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,389
Of course they should be told what is dignity
is, how to behave themselves.

176
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:35,620
But their little, little pranks are to be
understood and enjoyed because only as children

177
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,940
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they
should have that much freedom to play pranks

178
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,089
and to play some tricks on you.

179
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:52,160
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people
and might become ascetic.

180
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Those parents who are very strict, their children
are never normal; they either are extremely

181
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:10,099
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down
and they cannot face life.

182
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:17,619
So both are of the same style because one
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

183
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,619
life.

184
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:19,619
It’s like this.

185
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,880
Nobody can face such people.

186
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,259
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

187
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,339
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

188
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:30,810
So children only care for love.

189
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,259
They don’t know money.

190
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,710
They don’t know anything.

191
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,670
So the love that is you establish in your
child becomes very precious thing.

192
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:47,860
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine
love and it can only work when people are

193
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
loving.

194
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,499
If they love money, if they love power, if
they love their reputation, they love this,

195
00:21:54,499 --> 00:22:01,629
love that, and not their own children or their
families then they are absolutely losing a

196
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:08,589
very big part of the society and God knows
what’s going to happen to these children

197
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,910
if you do not have love for your children.

198
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:16,240
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various
things He has shown.

199
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:26,450
In His, you can say in His epic or in His
biography if you see, you will find how many

200
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,490
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

201
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:40,599
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills
the devil of Kamsa.

202
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:44,889
That too, how beautifully He does it.

203
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:48,200
How He kills the people who are surrounding
Him.

204
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:58,160
How He knows their secrets, how they can be
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

205
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,940
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

206
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:13,280
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

207
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,639
must have done it, because after all He’s
Viraat.

208
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:25,530
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands.

209
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,220
He can do whatever He likes.

210
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,930
He can play around as He likes.

211
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:39,469
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

212
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:41,849
simultaneously.

213
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,889
Then came His life when He became the king.

214
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:55,219
When He became the king He wanted, I should
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

215
00:23:55,219 --> 00:24:01,119
people in dharma and He needed the help of
the five elements.

216
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:08,420
So He made them into five ladies whom He married;
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

217
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,889
part and parcel of His being.

218
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:19,369
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

219
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,540
we can say, five wives.

220
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,060
And they were sixteen thousand women who became
His wives.

221
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,349
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

222
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:43,650
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

223
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,340
one thousand petals each – so it comes to
sixteen thousand powers.

224
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,850
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated
as women, were taken away by some horrible

225
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,180
king and He went there, fought that king and
brought these ladies.

226
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:10,440
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

227
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,690
think that there is good relationship.

228
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,040
They’ll always think there must be something
wrong.

229
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,730
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them.

230
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,010
But mother’s position is different because
mother can have thousand children.

231
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:31,610
But poor man, even if he has one woman around
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

232
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,330
So He had to marry all of them, so-called
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

233
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:45,589
stayed with Him by which He established our
Vishuddhi Chakra.

234
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:51,440
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

235
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,450
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

236
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,450
suffering.

237
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:08,889
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when
we catch.

238
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:17,270
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya,
madhuriya.

239
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,459
And His power was Radha.

240
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:23,629
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one
who has sustained the energy.

241
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:26,950
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

242
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,389
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She
had.

243
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:39,580
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

244
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,650
sweetness.

245
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:53,119
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

246
00:26:53,119 --> 00:27:02,410
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time,
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

247
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:08,869
So one should understand that even when you
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

248
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:09,889
“What are you doing?

249
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,979
Why are you doing like this?”

250
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:16,080
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

251
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Finished!

252
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,129
Right Vishuddhi over.

253
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:19,680
It’s finished now.

254
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,479
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

255
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:31,389
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

256
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:36,170
one boy who was serving his parents.

257
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:43,629
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

258
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,200
they appeared in the door.

259
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,270
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

260
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,940
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

261
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,350
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, “You stay on that."

262
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:07,670
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping.

263
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,030
Now this is the thing is.

264
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:21,010
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

265
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,240
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi.

266
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,489
So for that best is to take some rest and
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

267
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,650
stopping your talk.

268
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,369
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

269
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,259
For some time if you don’t talk you will
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

270
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,910
your problems will be improved.

271
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,430
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

272
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,270
It’s all in one play.

273
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:01,930
From the, we can say, not from the stomach
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

274
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,050
rising.

275
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:09,670
It first goes into right heart, as a result
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

276
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,950
or a father or something.

277
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,739
You might get asthma, anything, with that
right heart.

278
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:17,290
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

279
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,989
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

280
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:23,989
person.

281
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,660
All the time you shout at someone.

282
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,780
Nobody can talk to you.

283
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,160
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to
use a barge pole in between.

284
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,560
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

285
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,300
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

286
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,800
is somebody who is shouting at them.

287
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,499
So shouting is a very bad thing for others
and also for yourself because, of course,

288
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:54,100
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

289
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,570
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet.

290
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:07,150
But for others it’s even worse because if
you use your anger in that manner then that

291
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:13,219
person might be just frightened of you, might
develop inferiority complex, might become

292
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:19,629
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots
or God knows what can happen to a person who

293
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:23,589
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

294
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:27,609
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

295
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:36,849
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

296
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:50,089
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

297
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:57,339
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

298
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:00,949
But in modern times the other way round.

299
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:05,389
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi
is about to break or burst.

300
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:07,749
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

301
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:17,820
When they listen to this music, you see, then
it excites, then it excites you.

302
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,450
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

303
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,920
It excites you, excites you more and more.

304
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:31,920
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

305
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:39,150
And when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

306
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,150
more.

307
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,910
Then they have to put something near the ear
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

308
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:55,030
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting
cells become numbed.

309
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:03,800
And you have to really go in for tremendous
effort to create that excitement in those

310
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,989
numbed cells.

311
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:12,310
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

312
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:17,999
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain.

313
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:23,560
So then you take to drugs because your brain
is numbed out.

314
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:29,629
So you take to drugs and when you take to
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

315
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:34,660
Then again you feel that this drug is not
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

316
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,979
Then you take more drugs.

317
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:38,139
It goes on one after another.

318
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:42,900
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are
nowhere.

319
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,090
So it is all self-destructive.

320
00:32:44,090 --> 00:33:11,699
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

321
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:25,239
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence.

322
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:30,530
Those who think, who are very dominating,
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

323
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:38,009
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should
become silent and should, at least for some

324
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:41,410
time, should not talk at all.

325
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:47,719
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday."

326
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:52,810
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday."

327
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,982
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

328
00:33:56,982 --> 00:34:06,329
they will talk the most!

329
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:12,450
And this shouting and then intimidating people
– you have no right.

330
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,390
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

331
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,590
What is the need to shout?

332
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,050
After all, you are a human being, another
one is a human being.

333
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:30,000
God has not given anybody whether it is a
husband, wife, children or anyone.

334
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,050
But I find even these days children shout,
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

335
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,520
If you go in the house, you feel like running
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

336
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,750
but shouts.

337
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:50,210
So this kind of a family system will rock,
completely finish that family and there will

338
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:57,610
be no beautiful relationship between each
other and between the other people.

339
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,910
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

340
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,910
at another.

341
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,150
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

342
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:12,730
Even if you take your car little bit this
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

343
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,820
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

344
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,170
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the
best way to shout because they can really

345
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:27,990
impress people by their shouts you see.

346
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,170
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

347
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,280
When they speak, you should hear there’s
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

348
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
kind.

349
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,220
But they shout and by shouting a person gets
frightened.

350
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,750
“All right, you want the vote?

351
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,150
We’ll give you but don’t shout."

352
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:48,360
That’s how many people get elected and become
big and think that they are very successful

353
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,760
because they have been shouting (laughter).

354
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,580
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

355
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:03,410
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices.

356
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,600
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

357
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person
to talk, extremely sweet.

358
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:26,900
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama
as a person who was a king, and then you have

359
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,080
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

360
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,270
So what is the divine diplomacy?

361
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:38,850
You don’t have to shout, but you change
the subject.

362
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:49,360
If you want to bring somebody to a, some,
conclusion – then best thing is first you

363
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:56,680
change the subject and gradually, if you are
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

364
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,800
and you bring it back to the right thing.

365
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,310
That’s the clever thing to do.

366
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,430
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

367
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,540
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah,
I’ll do it."

368
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,060
That means something else.

369
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:22,300
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah”
anytime.

370
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:28,520
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person.

371
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,310
That’s what I did also in Russia.

372
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,760
I went round and round and round and round
and brought him to the point that we have

373
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,680
to be very independent thing, and I managed
it.

374
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,310
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

375
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,230
You see, because to face it.

376
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:50,170
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

377
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,510
everything,” then you should say slowly,
“All right, now I would say what you are

378
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,310
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

379
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:03,200
I agree with you and what do you think about
the other thing?”

380
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,510
something like that.

381
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,720
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

382
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,390
But I would like to suggest,” like this,
“if you can agree to it."

383
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:19,940
You see, gradually if you go and talk like
this things can work out and people can feel

384
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:29,840
really that you have taken time and you have
spent that much time and have accepted their

385
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,921
proposal and things.

386
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:35,200
And they don’t feel bad.

387
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:45,450
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy.

388
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:54,230
Can you tell me?

389
00:38:54,230 --> 00:39:05,400
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

390
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,270
Is benevolence.

391
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:14,670
You have to achieve the benevolence of the
whole humanity.

392
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,660
This is the essence of it.

393
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,460
If you are doing it, you are not doing for
yourself, for your gain.

394
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,380
You are not doing for the gain of any particular
person.

395
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,320
But you are doing it for the benevolence of
the whole humanity.

396
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,460
So once, you know this is the essence, so
what is the need to shout?

397
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,620
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

398
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:42,060
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

399
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:49,420
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

400
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,240
also very pleasing.

401
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,670
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

402
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,310
He said, “how can it be?

403
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,940
These two things cannot be.

404
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,910
Supposing you tell the truth people may not
like it, may not please that person.

405
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,120
So He said, “No.

406
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,870
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet,
priyam vadet.'”

407
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:19,500
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence
and tell the pleasing thing."

408
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,770
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time.

409
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,380
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t
go today by plane."

410
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,810
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

411
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,150
I’m going to go."

412
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,700
“No please don’t go.

413
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,860
I request you."

414
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:40,450
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash.

415
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,500
So he thinks, “This was good because for
my benevolence this has worked out.

416
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,110
So this is something so good."

417
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,620
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and
he feels that you have told him the truth

418
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,860
by which it was his benevolence and that’s
why he’s pleased.

419
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:02,030
So in the long run if you talk something for
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

420
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:09,120
of the spirit, then such a person immediately
thinks that we have really done such a great

421
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:19,920
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

422
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,910
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter.

423
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,340
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna,
which is the deity, knows it.

424
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,720
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody
and you know where that man is hiding.

425
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,390
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

426
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,360
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All
right, he’s there.

427
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,800
Go and kill him”?

428
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
No.

429
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,820
So what do you have to tell?

430
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,220
You have to tell him that “See.

431
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,580
I’m not going to tell you.

432
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,000
I don’t know.

433
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Doesn’t matter."

434
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,820
Because what he is asking is unauthorized
is anadhikar.

435
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,530
He had no business, he has no authority to
ask such a question.

436
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:10,180
And he had no authority to extract the answer
from you.

437
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,650
Whether you give him the answer or not answer
is your right.

438
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:19,580
If you understand that, it is not for the
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

439
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,740
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not
also for the benevolence of the person whom

440
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,540
he is seeking out.

441
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:31,700
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

442
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,760
You’ll find most of the people will just
like you because they will know that you are

443
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,840
sincere, very honest, that you want to be
benevolent.

444
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:50,150
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

445
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,910
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time.

446
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,810
I have to also tell lies little bit.

447
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:05,530
But whatever I do you will find out is for
your benevolence, is for your good.

448
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,330
I have to tell you.

449
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,360
I cannot run away from that.

450
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,730
I have to face it.

451
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,400
So you cannot run away from telling people
what you think is right for them.

452
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,140
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

453
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,350
Like you have children, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

454
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:32,830
are in charge then best thing is that you
have to tell them frankly what you think and

455
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,200
what is right.

456
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,300
It’s your duty.

457
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,290
Then people escape it also.

458
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,270
Many people who don’t want to face their
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

459
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:43,910
toys, toys after toys.

460
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,640
They will not like to face their children,
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

461
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
This is not good.

462
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,040
I would like you to do like this and this."

463
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,830
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t
mean something very dominating of one person

464
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:04,240
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

465
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,790
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

466
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:16,890
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where
you do everything for the benevolence of others

467
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,070
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

468
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:27,090
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

469
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:33,810
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people.

470
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:39,180
Because what They have done is for the benevolence
of the people.

471
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,420
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

472
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,790
is the lightning, in the lightning.

473
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,160
Now what is lightning?

474
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,810
He just shouts and roars.

475
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:03,810
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should
actually become a person who can shout and

476
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:13,400
who can scream and who can, I should say,
expose others as She did.

477
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,780
In the same way, you have to do it.

478
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,790
In that you should not be afraid, you should
not worry, and you should not think “How

479
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,670
can I do it after all?”

480
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:29,430
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a
type which has lost his confidence and the

481
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:35,440
ego has entered into the left side – it’s
a very complicated situation.

482
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,060
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it’s very important.

483
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,170
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just
a myth.

484
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,080
We want to escape reality that’s why we
say we are guilty.

485
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,960
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

486
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,260
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and
what’s wrong with another person and face

487
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,260
it.

488
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:05,720
That is much better than to just say, “Oh
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

489
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:18,460
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity
and electricity exposes people, she screams

490
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,720
at people, shouts at people, she roars at
people.

491
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,340
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have
to use these methods.

492
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:36,710
I would say a person who has an inferiority
complex should go to the sea and address the

493
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:42,560
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea,
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

494
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,540
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

495
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,900
same way – when they try they’ll become
great speakers.

496
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,090
It will be a very good idea for you to go
and just to give a big lecture and with that

497
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:08,820
big lecture you can always show that you are
not suffering from any inferiority complex

498
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:21,660
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut
way.

499
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:30,870
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna
is of the throat, of the right side, where

500
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,970
what is the power He has got?

501
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,770
The power is that He is sweetness.

502
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:45,270
He has the power of the shouting – or you
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

503
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,270
call it.

504
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:53,150
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

505
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,830
a contrast.

506
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:59,680
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya
too.

507
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,980
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the,
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

508
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:14,020
But what She does is to scream, shout and
show Her existence, that She exists.

509
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:19,000
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

510
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,690
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

511
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,140
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

512
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,290
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well.

513
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:37,710
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna
She is in a way very much subtler because

514
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,560
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

515
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,530
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

516
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,570
are passing through this.

517
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:55,760
It is bombarding this and from here, they
are going anywhere you want them to go.

518
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,240
You can put a computer on the other side and
you can computerize Me.

519
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:10,160
It is such a remarkable thing that the one
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

520
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:18,810
is the one which is on the left hand side
so that it exists in the people in a potential

521
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,810
way.

522
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:29,940
In the people who are feeling guilty, who
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

523
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,680
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

524
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,210
She exists in them.

525
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,730
See the contrast again.

526
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:48,480
She exists in them that Her power, She exists
in a person, or expresses in a person who

527
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,250
is not self confident.

528
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,650
And then She asserts Her power by which persons
become self confident.

529
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:06,840
This is how Her working comes in and that
is potentially within us also.

530
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,490
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there.

531
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:18,750
Any moment we decide, we can become great
speakers, we can expose people.

532
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:22,060
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

533
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,160
But normally we are not.

534
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:31,210
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

535
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:38,320
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

536
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,670
caught up, most of the people.

537
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,210
So they have to either see that they are not
guilty or they have to see that there is no

538
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,410
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive
in their shouts.

539
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:58,170
And, plus, they have to see that they are
completely in balance with themselves.

540
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:04,670
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

541
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,990
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet.

542
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,200
Artificially.

543
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,070
They have to take out some money so they’ll
be extremely sweet and nice.

544
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:22,240
Such people are really going to go to hell
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

545
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,200
in a very absurd manner and for that, they
cannot be spared.

546
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,640
So those who are artificially sweet are good
for nothing.

547
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:38,870
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

548
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:52,040
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

549
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,060
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

550
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,250
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying
to me."

551
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:04,710
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s
a general talk.

552
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:09,790
So what I’m saying is that if you are a
person who is a shouting type, please bring

553
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:15,920
it round and keep it in check and take rest,
give rest to your throat.

554
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,610
Some people are very happy if they are told
that “Today collector sahib is in rest."

555
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:26,340
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

556
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,710
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

557
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:35,880
No one likes any person who shouts, no one
likes.

558
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,770
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like
it.

559
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:45,180
Of course they tolerate, is different, but
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

560
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:51,040
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

561
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:58,770
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

562
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:03,960
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

563
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:09,612
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet
music in our heart we can never be, never

564
00:53:09,612 --> 00:53:11,950
be good Sahaj Yogis.

565
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:21,890
I hope today’s evening puja, though has
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

566
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:27,270
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi,
working it out.

567
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:35,740
And then to look at the Viraat and find out
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

568
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:47,030
– which can be done by anyone – and see
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

569
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,380
about your Vishuddhi.

570
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:54,300
And that’s only possible, only again it’s
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

571
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,970
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

572
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,350
point only, you become the witness.

573
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,560
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point.

574
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,300
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

575
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:15,860
If you have achieved the witness nature then
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

576
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:21,930
with you, what’s wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

577
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:26,150
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this
is the one that is wrong."

578
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:33,830
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

579
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:40,460
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

580
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:46,800
That’s what I told you that the fat of the
stomach goes in the brain.

581
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:54,970
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

582
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:03,450
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the
brain in the big macrocosm.

583
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:08,120
He’s the brain.

584
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:14,400
So people who worship Shri Krishna become
brainy people without ego.

585
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,890
Their brain develops and they have no ego
about it.

586
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:31,940
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

587
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:45,840
May God bless you all.

588
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:59,370
After this puja now you know that I’m going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

589
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,480
It’s terrible.

590
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:08,271
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India,
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

591
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:11,530
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to
Australia.

592
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:15,030
So this will be like this everyday practically,
I think.

593
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,350
But whatever it is I’m going now and now
you have some time.

594
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:28,300
We have lot of time now in between till I
come in October to trouble you again.

595
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:34,700
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

596
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,970
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out.

597
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:46,790
This is very important because I don’t need
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

598
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:47,790
of the world needs it.

599
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:49,550
But despite that I’m working so hard.

600
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,120
So you have to think that “Mother is now
gone out, doesn’t matter.

601
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,250
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

602
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,900
So please work out something till I come back.

603
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:08,890
I’ll be back here again in October, then
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

604
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:14,090
But let’s see what you have achieved and
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

605
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,500
to some fruits.

606
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,840
And that is what I’m expecting.

607
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:26,800
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

608
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,600
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much.

609
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,720
I don’t know if you know the names of all
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

610
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,990
all the leaders of all the countries and paying
your attention to them and praying that they

611
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:58,160
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja
Yoga to everyone.

612
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:06,640
Also they should be able to have visions,
to see what they can do and how they can combine

613
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,850
different countries and how they can work
out through their own countries.

614
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:17,320
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

615
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:26,080
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did.

616
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,760
They worked very hard and achieved such a
lot of things.

617
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,740
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis
who are with them, who have helped so much.

618
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,830
Thank you very much, all of you.
