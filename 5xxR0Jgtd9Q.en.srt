1
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:22,485
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Krishna’s incarnation.

2
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:31,275
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

3
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:42,364
So in every incarnation they carry all their
qualities, all their powers and all their

4
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:46,594
nature with them.

5
00:05:46,594 --> 00:06:01,664
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

6
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:15,745
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their
previous life has been misunderstood and have

7
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,515
been carried to the extremes.

8
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:49,225
That’s why they have to come back again
and again.

9
00:06:49,225 --> 00:07:02,665
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

10
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,815
is the preserver.

11
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:21,615
He’s the preserver of this creation and
also the preserver of dharma.

12
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:33,105
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma.

13
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:43,555
By keeping the dharma all right only, you
could get your realization.

14
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:52,875
So the job was quite difficult one, I should
say, to keep people in the central path of

15
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:57,205
Mahalakshmi.

16
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:13,105
So by first incarnation, you can say that,
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

17
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,105
Rama.

18
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:18,075
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

19
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:26,295
But as a result of that, people started thinking
if they have become queen and king, born in

20
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:33,595
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

21
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:43,925
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He
was the best among all the human beings.

22
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:52,785
That means He incarnated as a human being,
total human being, showing all the qualities

23
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,015
of human beings.

24
00:08:55,015 --> 00:09:09,345
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

25
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:10,485
married life.

26
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:20,575
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic
to show how a man should lead his life in

27
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:24,975
a proper dharma as a married man.

28
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:34,805
And even when the wife has gone away, how
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

29
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:41,195
And He never had another marriage, though
many people said that “You should have another

30
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,735
marriage."

31
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:55,975
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it.

32
00:09:55,975 --> 00:10:05,225
By His life, He showed how a husband should
be with his wife.

33
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:09,225
But then later on He had another role as the
king.

34
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:17,915
When He became the king then He found out
that people were criticizing Him because He

35
00:10:17,915 --> 00:10:22,765
brought Sita back from Ravana.

36
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:30,155
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from
Him.

37
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:39,235
How many people in this world, who are in
power, would be that sensible about that power

38
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:47,525
that they have, that they have to behave in
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

39
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:53,305
other people who are working under them, for
the administration, for looking after the

40
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,155
country?

41
00:10:55,155 --> 00:11:07,595
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

42
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:16,975
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people.

43
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:21,445
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

44
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:32,505
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

45
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:46,125
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

46
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:53,984
So there was no need to have any struggle,
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

47
00:11:53,984 --> 00:12:03,745
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

48
00:12:03,745 --> 00:12:13,145
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

49
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:14,935
should be.

50
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:25,335
As a result of His incarnation – always
people take to something, something which

51
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:28,715
is not normal.

52
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:38,465
So because He lived as an ascetic people started
following asceticism.

53
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:45,185
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

54
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:49,375
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

55
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:56,845
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints
used to marry, they used to have wives they

56
00:12:56,845 --> 00:13:00,145
used to have children, they lived a very normal
life.

57
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:09,435
Only they were saints because they were very
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

58
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:18,605
doing the work of realization and also other
corrections in human beings.

59
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:28,135
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

60
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:32,805
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic."

61
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:43,614
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled
in and then people became very austere type,

62
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,395
very austere.

63
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:53,794
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

64
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:58,624
was done in a very dry manner.

65
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:06,715
So many seekers did not marry but apart from
seekers many seers and saints also did not

66
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:13,614
marry and because they had no balance, because
marriage gives you a balance, they became

67
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:21,564
very dry people, very hot tempered people,
and we have some examples of some rishis who

68
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:31,145
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

69
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:37,085
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s
called as Bhasma Karoti.

70
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:48,945
So these qualities developed, that is the
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

71
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:52,855
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

72
00:14:52,855 --> 00:15:05,624
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

73
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:09,544
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called
as Leeladhara.

74
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:16,244
He was the one who showed that everything
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

75
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:26,494
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole
life is a fun.

76
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:34,794
He gave this idea because people had become
so austere.

77
00:15:34,794 --> 00:15:43,744
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism
started, like they would not eat, they created

78
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,735
a caste system which started developing.

79
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:55,195
The caste was determined by birth, which was
wrong, and they could not eat food.

80
00:15:55,195 --> 00:16:01,705
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

81
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,325
others.

82
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:22,234
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

83
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:34,075
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

84
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:44,174
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play
was brought forth, and the play was quite

85
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:58,934
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil,
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

86
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:12,214
was
mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother also

87
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:16,554
of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

88
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:24,244
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,
so it’s all a play of the same.

89
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:34,054
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

90
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:39,965
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all,
just see the drama as it worked out.

91
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:48,205
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was
very powerful and who was a devil.

92
00:17:48,205 --> 00:18:04,474
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

93
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:08,294
He was very young, He was about five years
of age.

94
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:17,455
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

95
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:23,005
very big snake – a cobra – very well known
cobra.

96
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:30,604
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis
with His power – in a play.

97
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:38,335
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you
must have read the stories about Him – how

98
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:45,255
He showed that there is no need to have a
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

99
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:54,164
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

100
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:58,775
But He never used all these outside powers.

101
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:08,654
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used,
to show that there is no need to use any army

102
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:16,474
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

103
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:20,934
And all was in a very playful manner.

104
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:31,725
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

105
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:41,224
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

106
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:44,594
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

107
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:49,984
It’s something like Mahamaya.

108
00:19:49,984 --> 00:20:02,646
But say all the cameras are now giving you
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

109
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:04,614
She is like.

110
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:12,035
But one may try to show that you don’t remember,
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

111
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:19,015
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

112
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:25,734
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won’t be able

113
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:32,825
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll
be such an awe.

114
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:40,515
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person.

115
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:47,724
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of
butter.

116
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,354
And as you know butter is very good for the
throat.

117
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:55,984
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times
that on your tea you put some butter and take

118
00:20:55,984 --> 00:21:01,274
it so that your throat which is dried out
will feel better.

119
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:11,094
So He was very fond of butter and He would
go and make His friends help Him, and made

120
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:18,184
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and
break the butter container and would eat all

121
00:21:18,184 --> 00:21:20,145
that butter like a little baby.

122
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:24,554
So one day His mother said, “All right,
why did you eat butter?”

123
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:25,905
He said, “I never ate."

124
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,864
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

125
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:31,515
He said, “This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

126
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:36,984
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

127
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:37,984
to that extent.

128
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,814
Like “don’t tell lies!

129
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:40,814
You must not!”

130
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,584
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

131
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:45,635
So He told her a lie.

132
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:48,604
“See now, these people have put it on my
mouth.

133
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:55,734
They have eaten all the butter and now I am
the one you are catching!” you see.

134
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,525
So she said, “Really?

135
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,814
Open your mouth!”

136
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:07,484
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

137
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:10,655
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth.

138
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:14,635
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi,
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

139
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,505
she just bowed to Him.

140
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:23,925
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?”
as if nothing has happened.

141
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:37,855
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

142
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:47,645
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

143
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:52,745
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

144
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:57,005
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

145
00:22:57,005 --> 00:23:12,285
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

146
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,386
are not attached to their children.

147
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,225
They don’t love their children.

148
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:21,045
They love their carpets, love everything else
because they can sell it, but they can’t

149
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:23,584
sell their children.

150
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:27,165
And that kills the joy.

151
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:36,464
So the children and the parents are separated
by materialistic ideas that this material

152
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:40,515
is more important than their own children.

153
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:45,505
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

154
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:46,785
steal also.

155
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:49,535
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

156
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:54,525
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal,
is bad.

157
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:58,745
But He was stealing only the butter of His
mother that He had made them.

158
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:05,184
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

159
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:12,675
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

160
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:14,495
very powerful.

161
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:19,755
So He thought best thing is to go and eat
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

162
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:22,174
be able to go and sell it.

163
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:30,765
Also if you see it significantly is this that
we starve our children, we starve our families,

164
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:33,525
just to have some money.

165
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:39,105
Money orientation is there, that you can go
and sell your butter to somebody.

166
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:44,985
With this idea – everything to be sold out,
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

167
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,535
out that.

168
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:50,475
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

169
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:58,895
So the children are the only permanent liabilities,
so the children are treated as if they are

170
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:04,174
just burdens while all other things are good
because you can sell it.

171
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:10,275
So the whole value system, if it runs down
to money, then children have no place in the

172
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,065
family.

173
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:23,594
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

174
00:25:23,594 --> 00:25:26,425
and they are to be looked after that way.

175
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:31,844
Of course they should be told what is dignity
is, how to behave themselves.

176
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:37,075
But their little, little pranks are to be
understood and enjoyed because only as children

177
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:43,395
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they
should have that much freedom to play pranks

178
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:46,544
and to play some tricks on you.

179
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:53,615
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people
and might become ascetic.

180
00:25:53,615 --> 00:26:00,415
Those parents who are very strict, their children
are never normal; they either are extremely

181
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:11,554
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down
and they cannot face life.

182
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:19,074
So both are of the same style because one
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

183
00:26:19,074 --> 00:26:20,074
life.

184
00:26:20,074 --> 00:26:21,074
It’s like this.

185
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:22,335
Nobody can face such people.

186
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:26,714
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

187
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:30,794
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

188
00:26:30,794 --> 00:26:32,265
So children only care for love.

189
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:33,714
They don’t know money.

190
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:35,165
They don’t know anything.

191
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:41,125
So the love that is you establish in your
child becomes very precious thing.

192
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:49,315
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine
love and it can only work when people are

193
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,315
loving.

194
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:55,954
If they love money, if they love power, if
they love their reputation, they love this,

195
00:26:55,954 --> 00:27:03,084
love that, and not their own children or their
families then they are absolutely losing a

196
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:10,044
very big part of the society and God knows
what’s going to happen to these children

197
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:11,365
if you do not have love for your children.

198
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:17,695
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various
things He has shown.

199
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:27,905
In His, you can say in His epic or in His
biography if you see, you will find how many

200
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:32,945
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

201
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:42,054
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills
the devil of Kamsa.

202
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:46,344
That too, how beautifully He does it.

203
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:49,655
How He kills the people who are surrounding
Him.

204
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:59,615
How He knows their secrets, how they can be
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

205
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:04,395
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

206
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:14,735
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

207
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:19,094
must have done it, because after all He’s
Viraat.

208
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:26,985
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands.

209
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:28,675
He can do whatever He likes.

210
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:32,385
He can play around as He likes.

211
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:40,924
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

212
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:43,304
simultaneously.

213
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:47,344
Then came His life when He became the king.

214
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:56,674
When He became the king He wanted, I should
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

215
00:28:56,674 --> 00:29:02,574
people in dharma and He needed the help of
the five elements.

216
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:09,875
So He made them into five ladies whom He married;
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

217
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,344
part and parcel of His being.

218
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:20,824
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

219
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,995
we can say, five wives.

220
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:28,515
And they were sixteen thousand women who became
His wives.

221
00:29:28,515 --> 00:29:33,804
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

222
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:45,105
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

223
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:50,795
one thousand petals each – so it comes to
sixteen thousand powers.

224
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:57,305
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated
as women, were taken away by some horrible

225
00:29:57,305 --> 00:30:03,635
king and He went there, fought that king and
brought these ladies.

226
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:11,895
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

227
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,145
think that there is good relationship.

228
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,495
They’ll always think there must be something
wrong.

229
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:21,185
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them.

230
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:26,465
But mother’s position is different because
mother can have thousand children.

231
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:33,065
But poor man, even if he has one woman around
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

232
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:38,785
So He had to marry all of them, so-called
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

233
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:47,044
stayed with Him by which He established our
Vishuddhi Chakra.

234
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:52,895
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

235
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:59,905
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

236
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:00,905
suffering.

237
00:31:00,905 --> 00:31:10,344
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when
we catch.

238
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:18,725
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya,
madhuriya.

239
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:19,914
And His power was Radha.

240
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:25,084
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one
who has sustained the energy.

241
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,405
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

242
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:32,844
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She
had.

243
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:41,035
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

244
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,105
sweetness.

245
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:54,574
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

246
00:31:54,574 --> 00:32:03,865
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time,
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

247
00:32:03,865 --> 00:32:10,324
So one should understand that even when you
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

248
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:11,344
“What are you doing?

249
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,434
Why are you doing like this?”

250
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:17,535
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

251
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:18,535
Finished!

252
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:19,584
Right Vishuddhi over.

253
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,135
It’s finished now.

254
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:26,934
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

255
00:32:26,934 --> 00:32:32,844
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

256
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:37,625
one boy who was serving his parents.

257
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:45,084
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

258
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:47,655
they appeared in the door.

259
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:51,725
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

260
00:32:51,725 --> 00:32:55,395
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

261
00:32:55,395 --> 00:33:01,805
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, “You stay on that."

262
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:09,125
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping.

263
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,485
Now this is the thing is.

264
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:22,465
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

265
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:27,695
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi.

266
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:33,944
So for that best is to take some rest and
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

267
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,105
stopping your talk.

268
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,824
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

269
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:44,714
For some time if you don’t talk you will
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

270
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:47,365
your problems will be improved.

271
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:53,885
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

272
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:56,725
It’s all in one play.

273
00:33:56,725 --> 00:34:03,385
From the, we can say, not from the stomach
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

274
00:34:03,385 --> 00:34:04,505
rising.

275
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:11,125
It first goes into right heart, as a result
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

276
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,405
or a father or something.

277
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:16,194
You might get asthma, anything, with that
right heart.

278
00:34:16,194 --> 00:34:18,745
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

279
00:34:18,745 --> 00:34:24,444
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

280
00:34:24,444 --> 00:34:25,444
person.

281
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:28,115
All the time you shout at someone.

282
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,235
Nobody can talk to you.

283
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:32,615
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to
use a barge pole in between.

284
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:35,015
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

285
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:40,755
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

286
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,255
is somebody who is shouting at them.

287
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:49,954
So shouting is a very bad thing for others
and also for yourself because, of course,

288
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:55,555
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

289
00:34:55,555 --> 00:35:01,025
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet.

290
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:08,605
But for others it’s even worse because if
you use your anger in that manner then that

291
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:14,674
person might be just frightened of you, might
develop inferiority complex, might become

292
00:35:14,674 --> 00:35:21,084
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots
or God knows what can happen to a person who

293
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:25,044
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

294
00:35:25,044 --> 00:35:29,064
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

295
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:38,304
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

296
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:51,544
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

297
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:58,794
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

298
00:35:58,794 --> 00:36:02,404
But in modern times the other way round.

299
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:06,844
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi
is about to break or burst.

300
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:09,204
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

301
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:19,275
When they listen to this music, you see, then
it excites, then it excites you.

302
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,905
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

303
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:24,375
It excites you, excites you more and more.

304
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:33,375
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

305
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:40,605
And when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

306
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:41,605
more.

307
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:47,365
Then they have to put something near the ear
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

308
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:56,485
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting
cells become numbed.

309
00:36:56,485 --> 00:37:05,255
And you have to really go in for tremendous
effort to create that excitement in those

310
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,444
numbed cells.

311
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:13,765
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

312
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:19,454
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain.

313
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:25,015
So then you take to drugs because your brain
is numbed out.

314
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:31,084
So you take to drugs and when you take to
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

315
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:36,115
Then again you feel that this drug is not
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

316
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,434
Then you take more drugs.

317
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,594
It goes on one after another.

318
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:44,355
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are
nowhere.

319
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:45,545
So it is all self-destructive.

320
00:37:45,545 --> 00:38:13,154
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

321
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:26,694
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence.

322
00:38:26,694 --> 00:38:31,985
Those who think, who are very dominating,
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

323
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:39,464
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should
become silent and should, at least for some

324
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:42,865
time, should not talk at all.

325
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:49,174
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday."

326
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:54,265
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday."

327
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,437
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

328
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:07,784
they will talk the most!

329
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:13,905
And this shouting and then intimidating people
– you have no right.

330
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:18,845
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

331
00:39:18,845 --> 00:39:21,045
What is the need to shout?

332
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:25,505
After all, you are a human being, another
one is a human being.

333
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:31,455
God has not given anybody whether it is a
husband, wife, children or anyone.

334
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:36,505
But I find even these days children shout,
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

335
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:41,975
If you go in the house, you feel like running
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

336
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:44,205
but shouts.

337
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:51,665
So this kind of a family system will rock,
completely finish that family and there will

338
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:59,065
be no beautiful relationship between each
other and between the other people.

339
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:04,365
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

340
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:05,365
at another.

341
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:07,605
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

342
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:14,185
Even if you take your car little bit this
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

343
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:19,275
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

344
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:25,625
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the
best way to shout because they can really

345
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:29,445
impress people by their shouts you see.

346
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:32,625
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

347
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:36,735
When they speak, you should hear there’s
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

348
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,735
kind.

349
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,675
But they shout and by shouting a person gets
frightened.

350
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,205
“All right, you want the vote?

351
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:43,605
We’ll give you but don’t shout."

352
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:49,815
That’s how many people get elected and become
big and think that they are very successful

353
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:51,215
because they have been shouting (laughter).

354
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:58,035
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

355
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:04,865
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices.

356
00:41:04,865 --> 00:41:10,055
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

357
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:19,955
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person
to talk, extremely sweet.

358
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:28,355
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama
as a person who was a king, and then you have

359
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:32,535
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

360
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:34,725
So what is the divine diplomacy?

361
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:40,305
You don’t have to shout, but you change
the subject.

362
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:50,815
If you want to bring somebody to a, some,
conclusion – then best thing is first you

363
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:58,135
change the subject and gradually, if you are
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

364
00:41:58,135 --> 00:42:02,255
and you bring it back to the right thing.

365
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:05,765
That’s the clever thing to do.

366
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:10,885
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

367
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:14,995
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah,
I’ll do it."

368
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:17,515
That means something else.

369
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:23,755
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah”
anytime.

370
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:29,975
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person.

371
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:32,765
That’s what I did also in Russia.

372
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:37,215
I went round and round and round and round
and brought him to the point that we have

373
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:41,135
to be very independent thing, and I managed
it.

374
00:42:41,135 --> 00:42:42,765
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

375
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:44,685
You see, because to face it.

376
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:51,625
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

377
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:56,965
everything,” then you should say slowly,
“All right, now I would say what you are

378
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,765
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

379
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:04,655
I agree with you and what do you think about
the other thing?”

380
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:05,965
something like that.

381
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:10,175
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

382
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:15,845
But I would like to suggest,” like this,
“if you can agree to it."

383
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:21,395
You see, gradually if you go and talk like
this things can work out and people can feel

384
00:43:21,395 --> 00:43:31,295
really that you have taken time and you have
spent that much time and have accepted their

385
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,376
proposal and things.

386
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:36,655
And they don’t feel bad.

387
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:46,905
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy.

388
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:55,685
Can you tell me?

389
00:43:55,685 --> 00:44:06,855
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

390
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:09,725
Is benevolence.

391
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:16,125
You have to achieve the benevolence of the
whole humanity.

392
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:18,115
This is the essence of it.

393
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,915
If you are doing it, you are not doing for
yourself, for your gain.

394
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:24,835
You are not doing for the gain of any particular
person.

395
00:44:24,835 --> 00:44:30,775
But you are doing it for the benevolence of
the whole humanity.

396
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:35,915
So once, you know this is the essence, so
what is the need to shout?

397
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:39,075
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

398
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:43,515
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

399
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:50,875
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

400
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,695
also very pleasing.

401
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:55,125
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

402
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,765
He said, “how can it be?

403
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,395
These two things cannot be.

404
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:05,365
Supposing you tell the truth people may not
like it, may not please that person.

405
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:06,575
So He said, “No.

406
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:10,325
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet,
priyam vadet.'”

407
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:20,955
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence
and tell the pleasing thing."

408
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:26,225
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time.

409
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:29,835
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t
go today by plane."

410
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:32,265
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

411
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:33,605
I’m going to go."

412
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,155
“No please don’t go.

413
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:36,315
I request you."

414
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:41,905
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash.

415
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,955
So he thinks, “This was good because for
my benevolence this has worked out.

416
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:47,565
So this is something so good."

417
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:53,075
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and
he feels that you have told him the truth

418
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:57,315
by which it was his benevolence and that’s
why he’s pleased.

419
00:45:57,315 --> 00:46:03,485
So in the long run if you talk something for
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

420
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:10,575
of the spirit, then such a person immediately
thinks that we have really done such a great

421
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:21,375
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

422
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:29,365
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter.

423
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:33,795
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna,
which is the deity, knows it.

424
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:39,175
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody
and you know where that man is hiding.

425
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,845
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

426
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:45,815
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All
right, he’s there.

427
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,255
Go and kill him”?

428
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:48,255
No.

429
00:46:48,255 --> 00:46:49,275
So what do you have to tell?

430
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,675
You have to tell him that “See.

431
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,035
I’m not going to tell you.

432
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:55,455
I don’t know.

433
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,455
Doesn’t matter."

434
00:46:56,455 --> 00:47:02,275
Because what he is asking is unauthorized
is anadhikar.

435
00:47:02,275 --> 00:47:06,985
He had no business, he has no authority to
ask such a question.

436
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:11,635
And he had no authority to extract the answer
from you.

437
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:15,105
Whether you give him the answer or not answer
is your right.

438
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:21,035
If you understand that, it is not for the
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

439
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:27,195
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not
also for the benevolence of the person whom

440
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:28,995
he is seeking out.

441
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:33,155
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

442
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:40,215
You’ll find most of the people will just
like you because they will know that you are

443
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:43,295
sincere, very honest, that you want to be
benevolent.

444
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:51,605
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

445
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:55,365
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time.

446
00:47:55,365 --> 00:48:00,265
I have to also tell lies little bit.

447
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:06,985
But whatever I do you will find out is for
your benevolence, is for your good.

448
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,785
I have to tell you.

449
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,815
I cannot run away from that.

450
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:13,185
I have to face it.

451
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:17,855
So you cannot run away from telling people
what you think is right for them.

452
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:22,595
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

453
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:26,805
Like you have children, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

454
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:34,285
are in charge then best thing is that you
have to tell them frankly what you think and

455
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:35,655
what is right.

456
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,755
It’s your duty.

457
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:39,745
Then people escape it also.

458
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:43,725
Many people who don’t want to face their
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

459
00:48:43,725 --> 00:48:45,365
toys, toys after toys.

460
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:48,095
They will not like to face their children,
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

461
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,095
This is not good.

462
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:53,495
I would like you to do like this and this."

463
00:48:53,495 --> 00:48:59,285
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t
mean something very dominating of one person

464
00:48:59,285 --> 00:49:05,695
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

465
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:10,245
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

466
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:18,345
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where
you do everything for the benevolence of others

467
00:49:18,345 --> 00:49:22,525
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

468
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:28,545
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

469
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:35,265
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people.

470
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:40,635
Because what They have done is for the benevolence
of the people.

471
00:49:40,635 --> 00:49:45,875
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

472
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:49,245
is the lightning, in the lightning.

473
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:51,615
Now what is lightning?

474
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,265
He just shouts and roars.

475
00:49:57,265 --> 00:50:05,265
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should
actually become a person who can shout and

476
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:14,855
who can scream and who can, I should say,
expose others as She did.

477
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:17,235
In the same way, you have to do it.

478
00:50:17,235 --> 00:50:21,245
In that you should not be afraid, you should
not worry, and you should not think “How

479
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:23,125
can I do it after all?”

480
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:30,885
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a
type which has lost his confidence and the

481
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:36,895
ego has entered into the left side – it’s
a very complicated situation.

482
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:41,515
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it’s very important.

483
00:50:41,515 --> 00:50:44,625
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just
a myth.

484
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:49,535
We want to escape reality that’s why we
say we are guilty.

485
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:53,415
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

486
00:50:53,415 --> 00:50:58,715
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and
what’s wrong with another person and face

487
00:50:58,715 --> 00:50:59,715
it.

488
00:50:59,715 --> 00:51:07,175
That is much better than to just say, “Oh
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

489
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:19,915
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity
and electricity exposes people, she screams

490
00:51:19,915 --> 00:51:27,175
at people, shouts at people, she roars at
people.

491
00:51:27,175 --> 00:51:31,795
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have
to use these methods.

492
00:51:31,795 --> 00:51:38,165
I would say a person who has an inferiority
complex should go to the sea and address the

493
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:44,015
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea,
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

494
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:48,995
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

495
00:51:48,995 --> 00:51:52,355
same way – when they try they’ll become
great speakers.

496
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:58,545
It will be a very good idea for you to go
and just to give a big lecture and with that

497
00:51:58,545 --> 00:52:10,275
big lecture you can always show that you are
not suffering from any inferiority complex

498
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:23,115
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut
way.

499
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:32,325
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna
is of the throat, of the right side, where

500
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:34,425
what is the power He has got?

501
00:52:34,425 --> 00:52:40,225
The power is that He is sweetness.

502
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:46,725
He has the power of the shouting – or you
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

503
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:47,725
call it.

504
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:54,605
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

505
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,285
a contrast.

506
00:52:56,285 --> 00:53:01,135
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya
too.

507
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:07,435
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the,
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

508
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:15,475
But what She does is to scream, shout and
show Her existence, that She exists.

509
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:20,455
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

510
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:24,145
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

511
00:53:24,145 --> 00:53:27,595
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

512
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:31,745
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well.

513
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:39,165
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna
She is in a way very much subtler because

514
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:42,015
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

515
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:47,985
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

516
00:53:47,985 --> 00:53:50,025
are passing through this.

517
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:57,215
It is bombarding this and from here, they
are going anywhere you want them to go.

518
00:53:57,215 --> 00:54:02,695
You can put a computer on the other side and
you can computerize Me.

519
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:11,615
It is such a remarkable thing that the one
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

520
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:20,265
is the one which is on the left hand side
so that it exists in the people in a potential

521
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:21,265
way.

522
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:31,395
In the people who are feeling guilty, who
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

523
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:36,135
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

524
00:54:36,135 --> 00:54:37,665
She exists in them.

525
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,185
See the contrast again.

526
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:49,935
She exists in them that Her power, She exists
in a person, or expresses in a person who

527
00:54:49,935 --> 00:54:55,705
is not self confident.

528
00:54:55,705 --> 00:55:01,105
And then She asserts Her power by which persons
become self confident.

529
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:08,295
This is how Her working comes in and that
is potentially within us also.

530
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:13,945
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there.

531
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:20,205
Any moment we decide, we can become great
speakers, we can expose people.

532
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:23,515
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

533
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:26,615
But normally we are not.

534
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:32,665
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

535
00:55:32,665 --> 00:55:39,775
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

536
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:43,125
caught up, most of the people.

537
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:47,665
So they have to either see that they are not
guilty or they have to see that there is no

538
00:55:47,665 --> 00:55:51,865
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive
in their shouts.

539
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:59,625
And, plus, they have to see that they are
completely in balance with themselves.

540
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:06,125
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

541
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,445
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet.

542
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:10,655
Artificially.

543
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:16,525
They have to take out some money so they’ll
be extremely sweet and nice.

544
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:23,695
Such people are really going to go to hell
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

545
00:56:23,695 --> 00:56:28,655
in a very absurd manner and for that, they
cannot be spared.

546
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:32,095
So those who are artificially sweet are good
for nothing.

547
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:40,325
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

548
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:53,495
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

549
00:56:53,495 --> 00:56:58,515
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

550
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,705
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying
to me."

551
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:06,165
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s
a general talk.

552
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:11,245
So what I’m saying is that if you are a
person who is a shouting type, please bring

553
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:17,375
it round and keep it in check and take rest,
give rest to your throat.

554
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:23,065
Some people are very happy if they are told
that “Today collector sahib is in rest."

555
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:27,795
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

556
00:57:27,795 --> 00:57:32,165
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

557
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:37,335
No one likes any person who shouts, no one
likes.

558
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:40,225
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like
it.

559
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:46,635
Of course they tolerate, is different, but
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

560
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:52,495
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

561
00:57:52,495 --> 00:58:00,225
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

562
00:58:00,225 --> 00:58:05,415
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

563
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:11,067
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet
music in our heart we can never be, never

564
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:13,405
be good Sahaj Yogis.

565
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:23,345
I hope today’s evening puja, though has
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

566
00:58:23,345 --> 00:58:28,725
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi,
working it out.

567
00:58:28,725 --> 00:58:37,195
And then to look at the Viraat and find out
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

568
00:58:37,195 --> 00:58:48,485
– which can be done by anyone – and see
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

569
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:49,835
about your Vishuddhi.

570
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:55,755
And that’s only possible, only again it’s
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

571
00:58:55,755 --> 00:59:00,425
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

572
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:03,805
point only, you become the witness.

573
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:07,015
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point.

574
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:10,755
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

575
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:17,315
If you have achieved the witness nature then
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

576
00:59:17,315 --> 00:59:23,385
with you, what’s wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

577
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:27,605
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this
is the one that is wrong."

578
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:35,285
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

579
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:41,915
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

580
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:48,255
That’s what I told you that the fat of the
stomach goes in the brain.

581
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:56,425
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

582
00:59:56,425 --> 01:00:04,905
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the
brain in the big macrocosm.

583
01:00:04,905 --> 01:00:09,575
He’s the brain.

584
01:00:09,575 --> 01:00:15,855
So people who worship Shri Krishna become
brainy people without ego.

585
01:00:15,855 --> 01:00:21,345
Their brain develops and they have no ego
about it.

586
01:00:21,345 --> 01:00:33,395
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

587
01:00:33,395 --> 01:00:47,295
May God bless you all.

588
01:00:47,295 --> 01:01:00,825
After this puja now you know that I’m going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

589
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:01,935
It’s terrible.

590
01:01:01,935 --> 01:01:09,726
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India,
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

591
01:01:09,726 --> 01:01:12,985
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to
Australia.

592
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:16,485
So this will be like this everyday practically,
I think.

593
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:20,805
But whatever it is I’m going now and now
you have some time.

594
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:29,755
We have lot of time now in between till I
come in October to trouble you again.

595
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:36,155
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

596
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:39,425
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out.

597
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:48,245
This is very important because I don’t need
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

598
01:01:48,245 --> 01:01:49,245
of the world needs it.

599
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:51,005
But despite that I’m working so hard.

600
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:53,575
So you have to think that “Mother is now
gone out, doesn’t matter.

601
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:58,705
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

602
01:01:58,705 --> 01:02:01,355
So please work out something till I come back.

603
01:02:01,355 --> 01:02:10,345
I’ll be back here again in October, then
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

604
01:02:10,345 --> 01:02:15,545
But let’s see what you have achieved and
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

605
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,955
to some fruits.

606
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:20,295
And that is what I’m expecting.

607
01:02:20,295 --> 01:02:28,255
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

608
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:34,055
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much.

609
01:02:34,055 --> 01:02:40,175
I don’t know if you know the names of all
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

610
01:02:40,175 --> 01:02:48,445
all the leaders of all the countries and paying
your attention to them and praying that they

611
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:59,615
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja
Yoga to everyone.

612
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:08,095
Also they should be able to have visions,
to see what they can do and how they can combine

613
01:03:08,095 --> 01:03:12,305
different countries and how they can work
out through their own countries.

614
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:18,775
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

615
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:27,535
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did.

616
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:31,215
They worked very hard and achieved such a
lot of things.

617
01:03:31,215 --> 01:03:37,195
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis
who are with them, who have helped so much.

618
01:03:37,195 --> 01:03:38,285
Thank you very much, all of you.
