1
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:16,087
So today's the Christmas Eve.

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,824
Should say tonight is the
Christmas eve and we are all here.

3
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:18,394
We have to understand that now we have really,

4
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:23,385
entered into the era of Jerusalem

5
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:33,610
and where you are built in such a way,

6
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,140
that we can understand,

7
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:43,501
the great incarnation of Christ.

8
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:49,715
So far, He was never understood

9
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:55,907
because it was a very subtle incarnation

10
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:59,245
and that,

11
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:05,132
has made people go much away from him.

12
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:12,320
From the principle of which he was made the innocence.

13
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:26,445
So today we have to remember how incarnated on this earth.

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,900
The innocence, the auspiciousness

15
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:39,030
which was filled by Adi Shakti to begin with

16
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:43,398
when She started to create this universe,

17
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:47,660
that He was the embodiment,

18
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,861
of all that which was so necessary

19
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,435
before the creation started.

20
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:13,506
It’s hard to understand how people could not feel it.

21
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:21,236
They all have suffered so much.

22
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:32,235
Whatever it is, for the Divine they do not suffer

23
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:39,286
and they come on this earth to show how stupid we are,

24
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:45,078
how we have not been able,

25
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:49,631
to see the Truth, to see the reality.

26
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:56,010
But we repeat the mistakes again and again,

27
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:03,251
because we do not know ourselves,

28
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,277
which is the only instrument by which you can know the Divine.

29
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:16,118
And when we do not know
ourselves we cannot understand the Divine.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,718
Still, it’s such a great thing to see so many of you are

31
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:34,598
there in that subtle area of the Spirit.

32
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:41,003
That you have the sensitivity, that you can feel,

33
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,540
the beauty of their lives, the greatness, the purity,

34
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,829
the innocence of these great incarnations who came on this earth.

35
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:06,669
But with all that, we have a very great responsibility also.

36
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:13,509
Christ had only 12 disciples who didn’t even get their Realization till Christ lived.

37
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,279
Afterwards they got Realization – 12 of them.

38
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,722
And imagine, somebody like Thomas came to India.

39
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:29,006
So, how they took so much
responsibility. They were just ordinary fishermen.

40
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:33,864
They didn’t care for anything else,
but they thought, “This is the Truth

41
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:39,542
and that we have to spread 
this, this is our responsibility.”

42
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:45,014
We are so many.

43
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:51,335
That is our responsibility. Is not only to enjoy yourself,

44
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,660
but to spread Sahaja Yoga

45
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,740
and to practice it.

46
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:06,468
Moreover, to have an ideal life,

47
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:13,265
that people could see us: how we behave, how we talk,

48
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,441
how we treat each other, how we love each other,

49
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:25,937
how we understand each other, how we run to help each other –

50
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:28,656
like one body.

51
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:38,617
The message of Christ’s life is love.

52
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,552
He openly talked about it.

53
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,888
Before that, I don’t think any 
incarnation talked like that, in that manner,

54
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,839
so openly.

55
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:00,576
He told His disciples that, “The greatest
joy for Me is to see that you love each other.”

56
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:09,209
All those things that have really made our society,

57
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,479
made our lives miserable of jealousies and pettiness,

58
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,953
small-mindedness has to go. 
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

59
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,226
Where is the time for jealousy?

60
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,679
There is no mind, this…

61
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,308
that can see those things, anymore.

62
00:07:36,103 --> 00:07:38,356
So, all of us have to evolve,

63
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:44,017
and the sign of evolution is not how 
much we can talk about Sahaja Yoga,

64
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:49,300
how much we can practice Sahaja Yoga,

65
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,298
how much we spread Sahaja Yoga.

66
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:55,537
That’s not the sign, don’t be convinced by that.

67
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,702
But the sign of Sahaja Yoga is that

68
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:04,411
how much we can love each other,

69
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,450
how much we understand each other,

70
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:19,540
how much we can endure for others with great joy

71
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:24,940
and how much we do not bother about ourselves,

72
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,699
our families, our children.

73
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:35,965
This ‘mine, my, me’ has too.

74
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,740
It doesn’t go by saying “go”. It’s a state, again.

75
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,145
But then only you should be convinced,

76
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:49,033
“Now I am a Sahaja Yogi!”

77
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:59,712
Christ has said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself!”

78
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:03,172
I would say that

79
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:07,977
you have to love every Sahaja Yogi as yourself,

80
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:11,836
because they are part and parcel of this body.

81
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:15,802
You cannot afford to hate someone.

82
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:22,098
Of course, those who are useless are thrown out of the body.

83
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:27,512
But those who are there living, you must love them.

84
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,645
I think this is the message of Christ

85
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:36,900
and other message is absolute morality,

86
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,359
absolute morality.

87
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:48,490
As He has said that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

88
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,650
is such a subtle thing to say,

89
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:56,799
that you should not have eyes which have adultery in them.

90
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:02,575
It doesn’t mean only for women but it also mean for saints.

91
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:11,068
It also means for properties, 
it also means for the success of others.

92
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:15,980
Adultery means the one where you try to aggress

93
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:19,508
and to be greedy about it.

94
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:29,473
If there is greed or if there is lust in your eyes,

95
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:32,830
then it’s an adulterous eyes.

96
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,740
It is very subtle, I know.

97
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,540
It is very subtle

98
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,715
and the attention is the best way

99
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:50,180
which communicates to you

100
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:56,801
whether you are above lust and greed or not.

101
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:02,780
But the more you try to rise above these things,

102
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,756
your heart opens

103
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:09,804
and you start enjoying your virtues, your morality.

104
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:14,570
You enjoy, you don’t think you are moral, you don’t think that way,

105
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:20,294
but you enjoy that state where you 
are really moral because you are moral.

106
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:24,603
You just enjoy yourself.

107
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:31,700
It’s a headache to be interested in some
woman, interested in some man. It’s a headache.

108
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:34,480
It’s a joyless pursuit.

109
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:39,789
And once you are detached,

110
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,247
the joy is complete…

111
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,772
…because you are one with reality, pure reality.

112
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,688
There is no …

113
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:06,620
inhibitions, no restrictions, no taboos, – nothing,

114
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,353
but just you are that!

115
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,196
Nobody has to tell you.

116
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,826
If you are gold, you are gold.

117
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,820
Nobody has to tell you, “Now, 
you don’t behave like non-gold”,

118
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,495
you are gold, so you are gold.

119
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:26,720
That’s the power!

120
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:34,391
And the power of a Sahaja Yogi is 
that he is the purest form of human being.

121
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,670
Without the power what are we? Nothing.

122
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,300
The purest form

123
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,780
and in the purest form of love

124
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:56,380
you get the purest form of knowledge.

125
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,660
This is [kaivaldya?] is the,

126
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:05,020
absolute knowledge

127
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,673
and absolute love,

128
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,803
detached, pure.

129
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:29,149
That time when you are in that state,

130
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:37,319
you just watch anything, see anything,

131
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:46,328
all the power of giving joy from everything

132
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:53,079
just starts bubbling into you and you don’t see 
the bad things at all, you never see the bad things.

133
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,900
The power of enjoying everything

134
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,898
is the power of Sahaja Yogis, to enjoy everything.

135
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Anything can be enjoyed,

136
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,154
any small thing can be enjoyed,

137
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,420
any big thing can be enjoyed.

138
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,964
But impurities one cannot enjoy,

139
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:27,089
immorality you cannot enjoy.

140
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,302
It’s not enjoyment, it’s just a fascination
 maybe, I don’t know what it is called as,

141
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:35,700
as I cannot enjoy then I don’t know what it
is.

142
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:41,887
But what you enjoy really is the purity of another personality,

143
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,891
the purity of this,

144
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:50,373
all that is done by someone with such pure heart.

145
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:55,091
And the deeper you seek,

146
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,722
it becomes simpler and simpler.

147
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:02,901
Then you don’t say smart things, no, you don’t,

148
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:07,243
don’t have to show off, nothing.

149
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,060
You just say simple, sweet nice things.

150
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:16,500
It’s so touching, so beautiful,

151
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:25,700
but must allow the deeper love within us to come out.

152
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:31,993
Many people love also but they don’t know how to express it.

153
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,967
There are many people who are misunderstood,
because they don’t know how to express their love.

154
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,060
In Sahaja Yoga you have to learn the yukti,

155
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,950
the technique.

156
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:50,326
“Yukti” is a very sweet word, not technique is not,

157
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,233
technique deals with something very materialistic.

158
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:58,599
But yukti means the trick, trick of the trade,

159
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:05,500
what to say when that would really just pierce,

160
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:13,614
like a dart in the heart of someone, the beautiful feeling.

161
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,498
That one has to understand and practice.

162
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,451
All little-little things here and there,

163
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:34,142
little turning here and there is 
an art of living a Sahaja Yoga life.

164
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:39,708
And I’ve seen children say such sweet-sweet things.

165
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:44,309
 That’s why Christ has said that, “You have to be like children

166
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:50,069
to enter into the Kingdom of God”, but I 
would say, “to stay in the Kingdom of God.”

167
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:55,808
You have to be simple like children, deep and simple.

168
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:07,623
This seminar, or whatever you may call 
it, Ganapatipule, I don’t know what you call,

169
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:13,832
is a Divine congregation of all the Gods and Goddesses,

170
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,953
is very symbolic to Me,

171
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,792
because this represents the whole world,

172
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,415
it represents the problems of the whole world

173
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,420
and also the solutions.

174
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,037
It’s such a beautiful idea.

175
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:41,757
I don’t know how it worked into 
My head that I started this kind of a,

176
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:48,179
beautiful congregation to meet you all.

177
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:55,340
It was very nice yesterday, you kept
awake all the while and came to see Me.

178
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,276
I could meet all of you and I could have some rapport.

179
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:03,179
I couldn’t say much, I was just smiling at you,

180
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,192
but just I could express My 
love and you gave Me that chance.

181
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:09,903
I must thank you very much for that.
