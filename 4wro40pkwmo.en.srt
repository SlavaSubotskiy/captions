1
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,150
so today that this was eve

2
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,620
Should say tonight is the 
Christmas eve and we are all here

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
we have to

4
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,570
Understand that now we have really
 entered into the era of Jerusalem

5
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,729
and where

6
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,610
[you're] [pete] in such a way that

7
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
we can understand the

8
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
[great] incarnation of Christ

9
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:46,869
so far

10
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,630
He was never understood

11
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,299
Because it was a very subtle incarnation

12
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,869
and that

13
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,150
Has made people go much away from him

14
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,380
From the principle of which he was made the innocence

15
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,699
So today we have to remember how incarnated on this earth

16
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,489
the innocence the auspiciousness

17
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,569
which was filled by

18
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,529
Adi Shakti to begin with him when she started to create this universe

19
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,879
[that] he was the embodiment of

20
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,310
All that which was so necessary before [the] creation started

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,499
It's hard to understand how [people] could not feel it

22
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,510
They all have suffered so much

23
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,279
Whatever it is for the divine. [they] do not suffer

24
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,180
And they come on this earth to show how stupid we are

25
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,919
How we have not being ever see the truth to see the reality?

26
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,100
But we repeat the mistakes again anything

27
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,150
Because we do not know ourselves

28
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,299
Which is the only instrument by which you can know the divine

29
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
And when we do not know ourselves

30
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,290
We cannot understand the divine

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,970
Still it's such a great thing to see so many of you are

32
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,620
there in that circle area oh

33
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,180
the Spirit

34
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,270
That you have the sensitivity

35
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,980
That you can feel the beauty of their lives

36
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,130
greatness the purity the innocence of the

37
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,299
These great incarnations who came on this earth

38
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,389
but without [that]

39
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,129
We have a very great responsibility awesome

40
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,009
Christ had only [12] disciples

41
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,429
Who didn't even get their realization deep fry sleep?

42
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,879
Afterwards they got realization

43
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:18,319
[Turner] of them

44
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,059
And he might give somebody like Thomas is [going] to India

45
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,269
So how they took so much responsible. They are just ordinary fishermen

46
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:35,528
They can care for anything else, but they thought this is the truth and that we have to

47
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,919
Spread this this is their responsibility

48
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,889
We are so many

49
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,620
That is our responsibility. It is not only to enjoy yourself

50
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,009
but to spread sahaja yoga

51
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,949
And practice it

52
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:02,528
Moreover you have an idea

53
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,949
Life that people could see us. How we behave how we talk?

54
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:18,699
How we treat each other how we love each other?

55
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:25,059
How we understand each other how we run to help each other?

56
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,539
like one body

57
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,539
the message of Christ's

58
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,749
Life is love

59
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,919
He openly talked about

60
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:49,778
Before that, I don't think any incarnation talked like [that] in that Manner

61
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:59,620
So openly he told his disciples that the greatest joy for me is to see that you love each other

62
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,319
all those things that have really made

63
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,109
Our society made our lives [was] never

64
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
after and pettiness

65
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,699
Small-Mindedness has to go otherwise. You are not sahaja Yogi's

66
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,348
Where is the time for Jealousy? There's no mind is?

67
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:34,608
That gal see those things anymore

68
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:43,369
All of us have to evolve and the sign of evolution is not how much we can talk about sahaja yoga

69
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:45,569
How much?

70
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,429
we can

71
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:51,499
Practice [say] Yoga how much we spread Sahaja yoga?

72
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,738
That's not the side don't be convinced by that

73
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:03,408
But the sign of Sahaja yoga is that how much we can love each other?

74
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,708
How much we understand each other?

75
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,809
how much we

76
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,009
[can] endure for others with great Joy and

77
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,928
How much we do not bother about ourselves?

78
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:27,349
[our] families our children

79
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:34,938
This is mine my me first

80
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:46,068
He doesn't go by saying go it's a state again, but then only [you] should be convinced now I

81
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,850
said

82
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,709
[I] said love thy neighbor as thyself I would say

83
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,390
that

84
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,680
you have to love every sahaja Yogi as

85
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,699
Yourself because they are part and parcel of this body

86
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,850
You cannot afford to

87
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,990
hate someone of course those who are

88
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,379
Useless I've thrown out of the world

89
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,200
But those who are there living you must love them [I]?

90
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Think this is the message of Christ

91
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,959
And other message is absolute morality

92
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,770
accident morality

93
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:50,930
As you said that thou shalt not have adulterous. Eyes is such a subtle thing to say that

94
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,849
[you] should not have eyes it have [adultery] [thing]

95
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,130
It doesn't mean only for women, but it also mean for things

96
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,249
It also means for properties it also means for the success of others

97
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,860
Energy means the one where you try to aggress and to be greedy Amar

98
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,670
if there is greed

99
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,639
Or if there is lust in your eyes

100
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,849
Then it is another precise

101
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,860
It is very subtle. I know it is very subtle and attention

102
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,070
Is the best way which communicates to you whether [you're] about?

103
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,239
[lust] and region or not

104
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,730
But the more you try to rise [above] these things

105
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,239
the Heart Opens I

106
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,610
Start in [you're] [virtuous] [Moron] to enjoy

107
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,999
You don't take your money don't think that we?

108
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,339
But you enjoy that state when you are really moral because you are more

109
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,439
Just [enjoy] [yourself]

110
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:32,958
It's a headache to be interested in some woman Justin in some man. It's a headache the joyless pursuit

111
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,818
And once it does

112
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,990
The Joy is obtained

113
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,289
Because you are one with reality your reality there is no

114
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:08,310
inhibitions no restrictions no taboos nothing, but just you are that

115
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,790
Nobody has to tell you

116
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,090
If you are gold, you're gold

117
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,410
Nobody has to tell you now you don't behave like non gold you are gold soon your world

118
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
That's the power

119
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,570
And the power of a sahaja yogi, is that is the purest form of human being?

120
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,740
Without the power. What are you nothing?

121
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,959
the purest form and the purest form

122
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,410
[of] love

123
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,230
You get the purest form [of] knowledge

124
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,890
This is [cable]. It's the

125
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
Absolute

126
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,130
knowledge

127
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,170
and

128
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,050
Absolute now

129
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,300
attached the [oh]

130
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:28,199
that time when you [are] in that state

131
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,389
You just watch anything see anything

132
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,040
all the

133
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,510
power of giving you joy from everything

134
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,680
just start bubbling into you, and you don't see the bad things [of] [are] you nervous about the

135
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:06,120
Power of enjoying everything is the power of Sahaja Yogi's enjoying?

136
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Anything can [we] enjoy?

137
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,350
Any small tea can we join?

138
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,279
Any big thing can make life, but impurities what your knowledge?

139
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,089
Immorality you cannot enjoy

140
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,830
It's not enjoyment it just a fascination. Maybe I don't know what it is called as

141
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,890
So I cannot enjoy them so I don't know what it is

142
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:43,199
but what you are really is the purity of another personality the purity of

143
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,529
this all that is done by someone it's a pure heart and

144
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
the Deeper you see

145
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:03,839
It becomes simpler and simpler then you don't say smart things. No, you don't don't have to

146
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,350
Show nothing

147
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,219
This is Simple street nice things

148
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,370
It's so touching

149
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,529
so beautiful

150
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,840
but

151
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Must allow the deeper

152
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,150
Love within an Astra coma

153
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,879
Many people love also, but they don't know how to express it

154
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,730
Many people who are misunderstood because they don't know how to express that?

155
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,520
Inside yoga you have to learn the you clean

156
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,950
the technique

157
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,869
It [Lt]. Is a it is a very sweet. Word knot technique is not

158
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,290
Technically you see something anybody released

159
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
But you can use the click

160
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,090
typically

161
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:04,509
what to say [when] that really just fierce

162
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,759
Okay, or like [a] dot in the heart of someone a beautiful feel

163
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,949
that one has to understand and practice a

164
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,910
Little Little things here and there

165
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,280
This is turning here and there then the art of giving a sahaja Yoga [lila]

166
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,799
And I see children sense of street sweet things

167
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,359
That's why Christ has said that you have to be like children

168
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,359
To enter into the kingdom [of] God, but I would say to stay in the kingdom of God

169
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,270
You have to be simple actually

170
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,030
D and signal

171
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,150
this

172
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,859
Seminar or whatever you may call it empathy blair to know what [the] call [is] the divine

173
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,639
Congregation of all the gods and goddesses

174
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,060
Is very symbolic to me?

175
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,290
Because this represents

176
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
the Whole World

177
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,989
it presents the problems of the old one and

178
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,870
also [captions]

179
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
such a

180
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:42,520
