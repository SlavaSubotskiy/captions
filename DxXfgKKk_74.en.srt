1
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:11,286
Don't know here

2
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,456
People in delhi

3
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:17,936
Have ever heard about
kundalini or not

4
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:22,123
And some of you have come new

5
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:25,367
But as many as are

6
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:28,240
They know what kundalini is

7
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,005
What does she work

8
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,393
Which of ours

9
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,580
In which part of the body

10
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:41,117
And how is it in us

11
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,456
Spreads self-realization

12
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,398
And you people

13
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,980
5-7 have come here from Jangpura

14
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:55,840
So I

15
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,126
Kinda explain to you

16
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,663
That,What is Kundalini

17
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,969
and self realization
how important it is to be

18
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,774
But I do not know
that in Jagpura

19
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,035
We have a center or not

20
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,544
Our center is on Pandara Road

21
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,536
Which is a very
close place from here

22
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,307
And you all go there

23
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,982
About Kundalini

24
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,339
Can take all information

25
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:31,648
What is this thing

26
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,314
And what mother is saying

27
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:38,559
After that if you allow

28
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,762
So the rest who are
sahajayogi,I will talk to them

29
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,262
Because very few
people have come here

30
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:47,809
Is surprising

31
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,343
That in our India

32
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:54,108
Delhi which is its capital

33
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,714
Anyone that ever divine
discovery is not special

34
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:01,480
Now if someone in our place
Tantric would have come

35
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,940
So here it all breaks

36
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:11,277
I don't understand why people
are not fond of reality

37
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,367
Why does everyone
get down to imitation

38
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:19,795
Where you are told that Babaji Have
come 'Just offer them so much money

39
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,839
So to offer them,
millions People will gather

40
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,410
We get to see the many
spectacles in mumbai

41
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:32,834
One gentleman

42
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:35,771
The say Ramayana there

43
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,008
while saying ramayana

44
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,304
Sita swayamvara is
also happen there

45
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:48,197
and with placed statue of sita and
rama they also get there marriage done

46
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:52,590
Then he says to whom
to bestow,they bestow

47
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,945
So is a special day
The day of marriage

48
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:01,163
So whomever you give to the girl It
happens to be jewelry or something

49
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:02,668
Saree n all

50
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,239
People reach them
with everything

51
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:10,325
And thus do kanyadaan thinks that
we have earned a lot of wealth

52
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,045
And we're going to have a
wonderful advantage here

53
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,269
So we're going to get
at least one million

54
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:22,703
Many ways in our
country for revolution

55
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980


56
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,423
Man then finds a place and
again reclaims another place.

57
00:06:29,621 --> 00:06:31,621
There he fetches a third,

58
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,670
What we are looking for
outside is inside us

59
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:41,532
We must not find
anything outside

60
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:45,965
You will surprise that
laxmi ji is also inside us

61
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,617
They don't even have
to look out for them.

62
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,916
So that's also inside us

63
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:54,638
And laxmi may be awakened

64
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,415
And you may also get the
blessings of laxmi ji

65
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,840
And within you may
shiv ji be awakened

66
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:04,308
So you may have soul blessings

67
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,537
But human beings always
love to Lie thing

68
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,981
Someone started gossiping

69
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:14,511
More people like it

70
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,936
Everything else he could
say was that it was obvious.

71
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,376
Get what is real

72
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,670
And do not follow
the falls things.

73
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,014
people don't like it

74
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:27,550
Suppose if people said

75
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,221
that lets offer prasad
have blessings

76
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,853
Throw the box of service

77
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:38,788
When the lifter comes, it will be so
light when carried, it will be heavy

78
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,460
For this reason

79
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,582
sahajayog not running

80
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,117
Sahajayog means

81
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,492
Easy

82
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:54,091
Believe what is born with you,
that power Sahaj yog

83
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,972
Yog means To be united with god

84
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:03,840
The power of ubiquitous divine
the power of love belongs to him

85
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,278
This must be real.

86
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:10,234
Really should be

87
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:14,844
Because of that you need a special
kind of consciousness inside you

88
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
That is collective consciousness

89
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,783
Means have no one left

90
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:26,812
You see that you are
always on your side

91
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:31,500
You can feel it on your own.

92
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:38,983
And what 's the problem with others
and you have a problem and so on

93
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:43,465
Can happen because of
being self realised

94
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,683
This is real,not a lecture

95
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:51,387
Should I give you
lecture or not true

96
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:56,733
So there are a few of you
who, as far away as you walk,

97
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,810
The rest of them.

98
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,326
You can find this system.

99
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,049
Today one gentleman Was met me

100
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:14,206
They got very bad,they said
"we read this book for god sake."

101
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:18,123
But before doing
any work we said

102
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,889
Why did not you
think that people who

103
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,298
To this function.

104
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,218
And participate in it

105
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:29,784
Did they gain anything?

106
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,686
You go to any of the doctors
where you get benefit

107
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:37,711
People will benefit from
this and you know this

108
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,971
You will not go to a place
where there is no benefit

109
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,590
Keep paying only
for one-way work

110
00:09:56,077 --> 00:10:03,361
You too must show strength Somebody say
that this sir is big, he is very successful

111
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:07,139
This is how you get two to
four rupees Will give away

112
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:12,489
It is a puzzle that really you have
come to mother's door to get money

113
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,629
And the other thing that
who shows such power

114
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,689
They own that power

115
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:23,058
No one else has that

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Every person in sahajayoga

117
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,855
It qualifies

118
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,414
That,to get this yoga

119
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:36,101
To get this self realization

120
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,260
Now you can also say

121
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,479
That,Mother's problem
was very difficult

122
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:45,181
Very difficult was very
Was barely Would happen

123
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,137
I said

124
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,969
But easy for us

125
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,452
Because we are rich

126
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,735
We know what to do with it

127
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,350
If we know anything

128
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,388
And specializes
so we

129
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,562
Can show in any way by working

130
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,718
So like such questions

131
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,558
What is the use of asking

132
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,137
So that

133
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:10,681
What do you use

134
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:13,281
They should do the same thing

135
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:19,104
That doesn't help you What is
the use of asking such questions?

136
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:23,237
Mother such hard
things How is that easy

137
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:24,620
Done

138
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:27,736
Something is there
in me and in you

139
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,959
There must be some thing but This is
the most difficult thing to understand

140
00:11:34,646 --> 00:11:40,190
And for which people got great
penance Had to suffer,they so easily

141
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:42,394
Mother gives it how it happened

142
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:46,680
It should be thought of then

143
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:48,992
That when you are fond of it

144
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:52,508
Please understand that there
is a diamond placed here.

145
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,627
And we are giving you free

146
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,069
That you would think
that this diamond

147
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:04,198
Take it here and then
see if it is true or not

148
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:10,407
Then after testing it,
if it is true then it is okay

149
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,392
But if we say that
it is absolutely free

150
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,807
Nothing to do with

151
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:18,437
So if you

152
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:22,775
Getting diamond for free
Nothing to do with

153
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,344
So all be true or false
What is your loss?

154
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,791
And when the mother
Nothing to take

155
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,101
Then why is she doing this?

156
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,741
What are they getting with it

157
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:42,044
So such a person can
also be in the world

158
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,190
That which

159
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:46,406
Works without
considering any profit

160
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,877
Maybe

161
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,818
You must have
heard at least once

162
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:57,361
That's why all these doubts

163
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,633
You shouldn't

164
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:01,861
You must think

165
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:07,494
That this Kundalini power in us The
pure desire is in a dormant state

166
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:11,496
Because one wish
Pure and that wish

167
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:14,503
That you are one with God

168
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:19,010
Until your wish comes true

169
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,323
Till then this power remains
dormant Considered to be

170
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:26,870
And put these three coils

171
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:29,435
Sitting in triangular position

172
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:35,287
When an expert awakens it

173
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,931
He has divine power

174
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:45,224
Put up some false commercials
And put it on the forehead

175
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:47,539
That I can awaken the
Kundalini, So can't

176
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:54,268
If there is such a person
That can wake her up

177
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:56,883
And his identity,Such as

178
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:59,409
It has been told
in many scriptures

179
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,342
In simple language
we will say that

180
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:06,982
Kabir Das Ji has said that,On the peak
of emptiness The sound of the universe

181
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,171
When Kundalini called him Surti

182
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,138
When it arises,
come here at the peak of emptiness

183
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:21,159
First dum dum dum such
heart sounds lap lap lap lap

184
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,435
Anahad

185
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:25,875
The voice of the heart
is known as anahad

186
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:28,729
Anhad,assume that any

187
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:33,412
Hurting another
thing Without doing

188
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,999
Extracts it is Anahad

189
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:39,184
Now that anahad sound here

190
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:41,719
Lap lap lap
As if the heart is here

191
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,541
And when this cycle breaks

192
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:48,892
So it should be said that here

193
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,955
There is a hole of the brahma

194
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,591
When that

195
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,272
Gets pierced

196
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:04,399
So that

197
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,798
You see that of the Kundalini

198
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,193
Comes cold cool breeze

199
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:18,116
After some time, that universal
power is also in your hands.

200
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,250
Whose reflection is Kundalini

201
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:24,375
And you also get cold
breez air in your hand

202
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:27,419
Cool

203
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:30,965
Not so cold But feeling cool

204
00:15:32,944 --> 00:15:36,548
And peace to many people
Meets and pleasures

205
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:40,548
And many people understand Is
that we are on the other side

206
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,247
A lot of people walk a
little bit with little doubt

207
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:47,991
But in the end that too

208
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,579
By understanding
What is the benefit

209
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,338
How is the benefit

210
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:57,618
But first Need to know one thing

211
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,017
That you nothing
to give to mother

212
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,519
Can't give you

213
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:07,498
You can't buy me And
you can't even tie me up

214
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:14,636
Just your love which draws

215
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:18,386
So politely accept it

216
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,783
If this thing happens

217
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,075
And if kundalini pierces
the Brahmarandhra

218
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:30,517
So this is the place of Sadashiva
Is the place of the soul

219
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,050
Where is the sadashiva
soul lives in the heart of man

220
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:36,545
So as

221
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:40,981
The back of that soul

222
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:45,040
Kundalini touches

223
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:46,627
So there

224
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:50,303
Inhabited soul

225
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:52,569
Comes to our mind

226
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,202
And our mind is

227
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,328
With that collective
consciousness gets published

228
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,337
Why don't you sit inside

229
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,637
Come, there will be no trouble

230
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:23,007
Pageant used to seeing

231
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,705
Now

232
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,943
I will request you

233
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,972
That in a while Will
talk with sahajayogi too

234
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:46,649
Because today is a good chance Very
few people have come here from Janpura

235
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,277
And after that

236
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,750
We will meditate a little
