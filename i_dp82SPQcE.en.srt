1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:14,390
…and this is the place where My forefathers 
reigned as kings and they had a dynasty also.

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:25,150
Now, the other place we went to, Musolwadi, 
is the place where the Goddess first of all

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:31,440
hit him with a beam so it is called as Musolwadi.

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,469
It means a beam.

5
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,500
Musol means a beam.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,829
So this is a place where Goddess has done 
a lot of work.

7
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:44,769
There is another place called Aradgao where 
he was running and he was screaming, so it’s

8
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,679
called as arad, ‘arad’ means ‘screaming’ 
(gao means village).

9
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:55,000
So the whole place is already very much vibrated 
because also the Nathas, the nine Nathas,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,989
we saw one Ganivnath there, but all of them 
lived in this area, worked very hard.

11
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,420
The last of all, Sainath, was very near here, 
as you know, in Shirdi.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:14,550
So this is a very, very holy place and a place 
of great worship where many a times the Goddess

13
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,670
was worshipped.

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:23,470
Rahuri itself, if you go round, you find there 
are 9 deities sitting there.

15
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,790
These are also created by Mother Earth, they 
are beautiful things.

16
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,890
No-one knows about them.

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,450
You can go and have a look.

18
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:44,330
There are 9 of them and these represent the 
9 incarnations of the Goddess, or 9 styles

19
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,670
of the Goddess.

20
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,240
Now, in this beautiful place we are here, 
though it is spoiled by many things, but,

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,030
as you can see, it’s very comfortable for 
our Spirit to be here.

22
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:07,720
At this place I have seen a negativity kind 
of thing was working out about [which] I want

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,890
to tell you today again.

24
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,530
That works out everywhere wherever there is 
a leadership of a person.

25
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,690
Here Mr.

26
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,060
Dhumal came and he got his realisation, in 
Bombay, at My residence.

27
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,830
When he came back, he started working it out 
here.

28
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,780
His brother brought him, but his brother became 
quite negative to begin with, and then the

29
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,950
negativity started working out and people 
started opposing him and troubling him and

30
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,810
I had to go through [a] very difficult period 
during that time.

31
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,720
So now, as you are travelling, I want to tell 
you: don’t challenge your leaders.

32
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:51,180
Because not only that it disturbs the organisation, 
but it gives Me a physical manifestation,

33
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,520
I suffer physically.

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,910
Specially if you come and say things against 
the leader in My presence I feel even worse,

35
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,790
and once it happened that somebody was talking 
about a leader and the whole of My back became

36
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:13,860
so red that lots of blisters came in and I 
suffered a lot.

37
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,410
So I beg of you not to decide about the leaders 
and don’t try to criticise them and take

38
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,830
up the ego position and try to see that “He’s 
like this, he’s hot tempered” or “He

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,830
is this, that.

40
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,870
” They have to be hot tempered! Because 
I’m not.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,640
Because I cannot be very angry, they have 
to protect Me.

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,260
As My protection, they have to be hot-tempered 
and they have to tell you off.

43
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,170
And if they tell off then you should not feel 
that they are bossy or they are doing these

44
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,350
things and all that.

45
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,430
Actually those people who are bossy only feel 
it, because they can’t bear that others

46
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,230
can tell them anything.

47
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,450
So they think that others are bossy and they 
are fine.

48
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,450
That’s not so.

49
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,940
So the trouble is that one should understand 
that one has to work in this fashion.

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,520
I know what the leaders are.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,040
When I find the leaders are going wrong, immediately 
I try to correct them.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,210
But you should not try to challenge the leaders.

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:12,500
But this is the greatest problem I had in 
the West and later on I found here also, in

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,280
India, it used to brew up.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,639
Whenever I went away, then it started off, 
the leader was challenged.

56
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,840
As if I don’t know about the leaders, as 
if I don’t know anything about them, as

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
if I am to be told, as if I am absolutely 
ignorant.

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
So you don’t have to worry.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
You shouldn’t worry about it.

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,260
I will tell you who is the leader and how 
to work it out.

61
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,300
It sometimes of course happens, that the leaders 
go off.

62
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,410
I know that they go off.

63
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,180
It happens that they fall a trap to a wrong 
person.

64
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:45,030
It’s quite possible, after all they have 
become leaders just like you, with My special

65
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,030
permission.

66
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,490
But could be such a situation can come up 
and I want to then correct them and I always

67
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,960
tell them that “is a wrong thing you have 
done.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
This is to be corrected.

69
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,880
” But otherwise the whole administration 
of Sahaja Yoga is impossible.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,330
It has to work through the leaders.

71
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,060
You shouldn’t see how they talk, what they 
say to you, what they work out, but do what

72
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
they tell you.

73
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,340
There is no freedom lost in that.

74
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,040
You will see that your freedom will be maintained, 
respected and will be done.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,840
On the contrary, I would say, when there is 
a sloppy and a mild leadership it [is] just

76
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
impossible.

77
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Everybody else becomes the leader.

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,550
Like England, we can say, that Gavin was very, 
very mild and now there are so many leaders

79
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,350
who come up, talk big, “Do this! Do that!” 
I’m having a big problem in England of so

80
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,950
many mushroom like egos coming up.

81
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,600
And they become so flippant and nonsensical, 
and they talk all nonsense, they start giving

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
lectures, this, that.

83
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It’s impossible then to control.

84
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,111
If Gavin was a strong fellow and he put them 
right.

85
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,330
But he’s too good and too much of a gentleman, 
I think.

86
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,660
That much of gentlemanliness is of no use 
in Sahaja Yoga.

87
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,669
So if he had handled the whole situation, 
with that thing is alright and would have

88
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,150
worked out very well.

89
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,620
But sometimes also the leader is told to shut 
up, “You shut up!” And like that he goes

90
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:09,020
on shutting up everybody joins hands and shuts 
up the leader and the leader becomes absolutely

91
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
a cabbage.

92
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,100
He doesn’t say anything.

93
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,419
So this is also a very bad habit is to say, 
“Shut up, don’t say anything!” I don’t

94
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,419
like it.

95
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,880
If somebody is talking to Me, anybody who 
is talking to Me, you shouldn’t just in

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,160
front of Me say “Shut up!” to that person 
or pull his hand, or just punch him or…

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,380
I don’t like all that, at all.

98
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,389
That hurts Me.

99
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,410
So never do like that.

100
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,800
I’ve seen people have a this very bad habit, 
“Don’t say!” “Don’t talk!” as

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,250
if they are the greatest, wisest people ever 
born to say such a thing.

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,699
Is a very wrong idea and this should not be 
done.

103
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,759
This should never be done in My presence, 
I don’t like it, it hurts Me and physically

104
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,880
it manifests.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,450
So don’t do like this, don’t say anything, 
don’t do! I know how to handle it.

106
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,570
If somebody is very funny I can tell that 
person, “Now stop it!” I can do it.

107
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,419
But you just don’t try to take over things 
like that.

108
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,550
Of course the leaders can do it, leaders, 
the ones who are grown up, matured people,

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,650
can just tell them to keep quiet.

110
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,500
But all the time some people have the habit 
of saying “No!” and “No!” Is bhootish,

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,060
I would say.

112
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,150
Is really bhootish because they never allow 
Me to see the reality.

113
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,289
We must know what’s happening, what people 
have to say.

114
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,820
I should know about it.

115
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,990
There’s nothing wrong in it.

116
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,170
But on the contrary, they come and tell Me, 
“Our leader is like that, our leader is

117
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,170
like that.

118
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,900
” That you don’t worry because My attention 
is most on your leaders.

119
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,320
I do change leaders and I will change leaders 
in case they are wrong.

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,389
But let Me decide.

121
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,449
That decision you leave it to Me.

122
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:41,460
So this is another point I wanted to say about 
Rahuri, which I learnt a lesson here.

123
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,620
Then another thing I found out: The villagers 
here are much more easily convincing, they

124
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,740
take to Sahaja Yoga very well and while the 
educated take time to take to Sahaja Yoga.

125
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,600
Naturally because they think they are very 
well educated and they find it difficult to

126
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,140
forget their education and become simpler 
people.

127
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,039
So in the same way, you’ll find the simple 
people will take to Sahaja Yoga much faster

128
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:09,470
than the people who are educated because their 
mind works too fast, they cannot catch the

129
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:15,580
vibrations, mind is running fast, the vibrations 
are running after them and it’s a big game

130
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,870
of hide and seek going on! But doesn’t matter.

131
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,220
Still once that intelligent get to Sahaja 
Yoga, then it works even wonders.

132
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,620
Once they get to it, they take time, no doubt, 
but they take time, but once they take get

133
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,580
to it then it works wonders.

134
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,339
So some people take it easily, but they don’t 
work out that well; those who take with difficulty,

135
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:43,430
work out better, in the sense that they can 
intelligently manifest it and talk to people

136
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,650
and tell them about it.

137
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,430
So this is another thing one has to remember 
that – try to understand that through your

138
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,180
education you have not known anything because 
you never felt vibrations, you did not even

139
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,070
know that there was something like that existing! 
This is a new knowledge, absolutely a new

140
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,560
thing, absolutely it has nothing to do with 
your degrees, M.

141
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
A.

142
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
D.

143
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
and Ph.

144
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
D.

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
s and all those things.

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,990
It is something else that is existing, which 
you have to feel.

147
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,220
So if you take that simple attitude it would 
be a better idea.

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:22,140
Now the fourth thing which upsets Me is grouping, 
to form a group.

149
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,130
That’s another very upsetting thing is to 
form a group.

150
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,630
This is one group of this place, a group of 
that place, we belong to this place.

151
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,870
And this grouping once takes place, you see, 
there is a gap in the collective.

152
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:40,260
When there is a grouping, say, a nose, an 
eyes they become a group, then there is a

153
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,630
gap between them and the hands.

154
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,980
So if there’s a problem in the nose, the 
hands will not act.

155
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,790
So the whole activity becomes a disintegrated 
activity.

156
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,120
So one should never form a group, you see, 
those who have a habit of forming a group

157
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,990
must be completely discouraged.

158
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,200
They start saying against somebody, then against 
that one, then this that, then they form a

159
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,260
group, the one group goes there, one group… 
so grouping is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,

160
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,300
it is malignancy.

161
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,339
It is malignancy.

162
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,450
If it starts working out, you become malignant, 
the whole group becomes malignant and it’s

163
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,470
a very difficult problem then to put them 
right.

164
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,990
And one should not accept any sort of a sloppy 
or a very mild leadership also.

165
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:30,090
One should accept a strong, fierce I would 
say, to some extent, leadership.

166
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,090
That will help.

167
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:36,490
Because our ideas are very different from 
what you have had so far, that “The leader

168
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:43,880
should be pleasing to us, he should have a 
personality that will be extremely lovey-dovey

169
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
type”.

170
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
That’s not so.

171
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,110
The leader has to be a strong fierce personality 
that should make people respect him and have

172
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,110
awe for him.

173
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:56,250
Because we are so free we can pass remarks 
about the leader, say, “This leader is bad,

174
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,680
that leader is bad.

175
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,089
” But it’s not a good thing, it doesn’t 
help, it doesn’t help.

176
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,330
On the contrary, as I told you, the sloppy 
people create horrible problems and then you

177
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,370
get so many egoistical people who come up.

178
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,360
I mean a sloppy person, if there’s one sloppy 
person or who has accepted such a domination,

179
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,070
if he is there as a leader, all the rest of 
the people, those who come in contact with

180
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,779
that person, also become ego-oriented.

181
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,670
They also start behaving in such a manner 
that you can’t imagine.

182
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,700
Like Gavin’s is a very good example.

183
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,760
In his office he had arranged to work for 
some people.

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,310
Everyone who worked in his office got into 
this trouble, because he was so good that

185
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,410
they picked up their ego, you see, because 
their superego was there, so they thought

186
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,840
better to use your ego and that’s how the 
whole thing worked out.

187
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,740
Poor fellow had to ask all of them to get 
out of the office.

188
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,760
So this is an example for us and there’s 
nothing to feel that it is any criticism of

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
anything, but it doesn’t work out.

190
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,830
This system doesn’t work out.

191
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:08,620
So you should not try to make a effort that 
you criticise them.

192
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,040
Now, another thing about leadership I have 
to tell you that – supposing I’ve appointed

193
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,430
Christine as a leader, she is the leader of 
North America, then she has to take the decisions

194
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,760
for North America.

195
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,930
But nobody else, not even her husband, should 
not take any decisions.

196
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,430
He should not, he should have nothing to do, 
he should be in the background.

197
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,320
Whosoever is the leader should deal with the 
problem.

198
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,510
This is the trouble is, if the wife is there, 
then the husband takes over, husband gets,

199
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,089
then the wife … Like I should say Poona, 
Poona, I appointed somebody there, he was

200
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:42,209
shut down and his wife took over and the wife 
is a horrid stuff, I mean, I don’t know

201
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,540
what to do with such things.

202
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,910
It is very difficult that, if it’s a husband, 
it’s a husband, it’s a wife, it’s a

203
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,690
wife, then the wife becomes little dominating, 
the husband comes back and then the husband

204
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,690
starts ruling.

205
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,200
Then My attention is on the wife, here the 
husband becomes.

206
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,460
In leadership there is nothing like husband 
and wife.

207
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
They have nothing to do.

208
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,740
Whosoever is the leader is to be accepted 
as the leader, whether he is the husband or

209
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
the wife.

210
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,230
This is one thing, in Sahaja Yoga there is 
no discrimination between women and men.

211
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,720
Not that the men should always rule nor the 
women should rule.

212
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
It is whosoever is appointed as the leader 
is the leader.

213
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I must tell you these things because these 
little, little things make such a difference

214
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,079
to the whole organisation that I don’t know 
how to tell you.

215
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,410
Because husband has no right as a leader.

216
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,020
He’s not appointed as a leader, so he has 
no right as a leader.

217
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,870
If you all understand this point that leadership 
is very important for Me, it’s like the

218
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,800
main organ of the body.

219
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,270
And that leadership should not be challenged 
at any cost, any time.

220
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,270
Like Dr.

221
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,310
Sangve is the leader of Nasik.

222
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,880
So he is the leader.

223
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,470
He has to do it.

224
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,670
It is he who decides, it is he who says.

225
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,290
Nobody should challenge.

226
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,730
So we have got leaders of different places, 
if you have any problems about deciding who

227
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,570
is the leader, you come and ask Me.

228
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,570
I always appoint one person.

229
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,930
In Italy, Gregoire, I don’t know why, he 
said there should be two persons.

230
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,810
I don’t know why he said two.

231
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,720
But I told him, “Gregoire, it’s not a 
wrong thing”, but he just said, “No, must

232
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
have.

233
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,540
” And the second one was dropped out so 
badly, I mean he really harmed us.

234
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,870
So just listen to Me! I know, I understand.

235
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,839
Guido can say that what has happened in Italy 
is because they didn’t listen to Me.

236
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,850
Here we are not to please everyone.

237
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,260
No, you are not here to take any voting or 
anything, we are here to do the job and for

238
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,920
doing the job you must take the right course, 
right methods.

239
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,830
So those who think “O, have three of them” 
then “have five of them.

240
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,470
” This is nonsense! For what? Just to pamper 
ego?

241
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,700
Any leader is as good as you people are, the 
only difference is My attention is on that

242
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
leader.

243
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,100
That’s why it works out better.

244
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,960
Don’t allow your ego to dominate you.

245
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,510
That’s nothing… What does he do? Poor 
man, the leader now, for example, I would

246
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,510
say, Warren.

247
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,029
He worked so hard, he really laboured through, 
he worked so hard he got so sick, I was wondering

248
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,149
it’s all right for Me.

249
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:07,820
I’m after all a, Adi Shakti, so it doesn’t 
matter (laughter) I can be, I can be marathon.

250
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,399
But this fellow was working with Me.

251
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,980
I knew he’ll have to give way at a point.

252
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
It’s too much.

253
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,070
And then people start criticising Warren, 
I can’t understand.

254
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,780
I mean, he is working day in and day out, 
can’t they see this? Without him what would

255
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
have happened to us?

256
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:28,570
I mean those who are leaders work so hard, 
they do so much and then you start criticising.

257
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
That’s not proper.

258
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,700
That’s being a bit ingratitude towards them 
and towards Me.

259
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,920
On the contrary, I feel so much obliged to 
them.

260
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,690
After all this is My job, this is I’m paid 
for it, I can say.

261
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,970
So I’m doing this job, alright.

262
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,000
But what about them? They are human beings, 
they have got their other things.

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,217
I don’t have to earn money, I don’t have 
any problems, so why, why bother them? They

264
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:57,240
are the ones who have dedicated their lives 
doing so much and then you start criticising

265
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
them.

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
It is impossible.

267
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,500
But if he says anything to you, “Don’t 
do this and don’t do that”, sometimes

268
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,930
it is with My consultation he does it.

269
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,020
What things I cannot say directly he might 
say indirectly to you, so you shouldn’t

270
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,040
challenge such things.

271
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,850
This is one of the things today I wanted to 
talk, about leadership, because this is a

272
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:22,649
place where I have faced some problems of 
leadership, and one should understand that

273
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,650
this is the only way Sahaja Yoga is going 
to work out.

274
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:32,649
In the body also, as you know, it is not that 
the heart, which is the heart is the complete

275
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,649
pumping source.

276
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,230
No! The heart’s work is to be accepted, 
that it is this pumping source, and it gives

277
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,480
to all the other organs.

278
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,850
So liver is liver, brain is brain, brain doesn’t 
want to become the heart, heart doesn’t

279
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,850
want to become the liver.

280
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,180
Now the liver cells, if they say that, “Now 
we will work for the heart” or “We’ll

281
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,190
form a group”, then how can you do? So as 
we have got very important organs, we have

282
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,950
got very important leaders and I know what 
they are up to, I know what’s wrong with

283
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,495
them, so you leave it to Me to correct them.

284
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:10,409
Alright this is for the foreigners today because 
now we’ll be moving further and further

285
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:15,059
into more difficult time, I think, because 
there may be little spartan living for you

286
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,489
because you asked for it! You wanted to have 
a camping ground, so I am having the camping

287
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:21,489
ground.

288
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,929
So then you should not say [about] the leader 
“Where is he? Now Call him! What have you

289
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,179
done?” It’s all arranged by Me, so don’t 
blame him and enjoy yourself.

290
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,210
And don’t try to say that he should have 
looked after.

291
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,919
He is not paid for it.

292
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,120
He is not paid for it.

293
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,070
I’m paid for it, they are not, in the sense 
I’m paid because I am made for that, it’s

294
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,570
My job, I’m doing it because I have to do 
it.

295
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,379
I cannot do anything else but to do this job, 
otherwise I won’t exist, you see.

296
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:51,640
So Mine is a different point.

297
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:59,639
But if he’s doing it, then it is an obligation 
on Me and in a way I feel, you also should

298
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,580
feel obliged.

299
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,450
May God bless you all.
