37
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,390
so well it's very difficult to break the

38
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,820
sahasrara and when I really broke it I

39
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:10,090
didn't know that it would be that

40
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,400
successful first I thought is still

41
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:16,950
premature because there are many

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,290
daksha's are still on this street

43
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,169
selling their books and there are many

44
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,669
fanatics who are calling themselves by

45
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,700
the so-called religions they are

46
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:33,280
following not the real religion of the

47
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:37,330
earth but gradually it has taken its

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,320
roots now let this truth take its root

49
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:45,160
within yourself through your system and

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,860
once this truth becomes absolutely the

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,290
light that guides you the light that

52
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,060
nourishes you the light that enlightens

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:58,419
you and gives you a personality that has

54
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,120
the light then only you should know that

55
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,910
your sister arise completely enlightened

56
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,180
by your spirit your face should be such

57
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,490
that people should know that there's a

58
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,800
personality was standing before you

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,340

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,340
be looked after
