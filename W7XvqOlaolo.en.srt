1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:27,840
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri
Krishna's incarnation. As you know that Shri

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:37,420
Krishna is the incarnation of Narayana, of
Shri Vishnu. So in every incarnation they

3
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:51,170
carry all their qualities, all their powers
and all their nature with them. So when He

4
00:00:51,170 --> 00:01:05,700
incarnated He had all the qualities of Narayana
and then that of Rama, but every incarnation

5
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:18,500
tries to rectify whatever in their previous
life has been misunderstood and have been

6
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:42,039
carried to the extremes. That's why they have
to come back again and again.

7
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:58,780
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

8
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:13,460
is the preserver. He's the preserver of this
creation and also the preserver of dharma.

9
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:24,510
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma. By keeping

10
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:38,379
the dharma all right only, you could get your
realization. So the job was quite difficult

11
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:53,849
one, I should say, to keep people in the central
path of Mahalakshmi. So by first incarnation,

12
00:02:53,849 --> 00:03:05,830
you can say that, He tried to create a benevolent
king, as Shri Rama. Socrates has described

13
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:14,860
a benevolent king. But as a result of that,
people started thinking if they have become

14
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:24,629
queen and king, born in the family of royalty,
then they are gods.

15
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:33,330
Shri Rama was the Purushottama - means He
was the best among all the human beings. That

16
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:41,950
means He incarnated as a human being, total
human being, showing all the qualities of

17
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:55,659
human beings. Like He was, He married the
Lakshmi principle that was Sita, and then

18
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:04,659
also He lived a normal married life. When
He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic to

19
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:14,480
show how a man should lead his life in a proper
dharma as a married man. And even when the

20
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:24,930
wife has gone away, how He was leading a life
of complete chastity. And He never had another

21
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:32,070
marriage, though many people said that "You
should have another marriage."

22
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:43,550
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it. By His life, He

23
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:54,750
showed how a husband should be with his wife.
But then later on He had another role as the

24
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:04,259
king. When He became the king then He found
out that people were criticizing Him because

25
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:16,270
He brought Sita back from Ravana. So Shri
Rama decided to send Her away from Him. How

26
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:25,210
many people in this world, who are in power,
would be that sensible about that power that

27
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:33,750
they have, that they have to behave in a manner
that they should be ideals, for all other

28
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,819
people who are working under them, for the
administration, for looking after the country?

29
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:50,180
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

30
00:05:50,180 --> 00:06:01,979
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people. So they say

31
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,310
the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

32
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:16,259
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

33
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:29,830
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace. So

34
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:38,330
there was no need to have any struggle, no
competition, no fighting, nothing. So this

35
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:47,819
Benevolent King came as a incarnation to show
us how a king should be, and He lead a life

36
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:56,270
of a serious type, very dedicated and serious
type of life, how a benevolent king should

37
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:07,830
be. As a result of His incarnation - always
people take to something, something which

38
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:22,979
is not normal. So because He lived as an ascetic
people started following asceticism. "We'll

39
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:29,740
not marry, we'll not have our wives, we'll
live like Rama," all these things they started,

40
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,599
so asceticism grew up. Before that, before
Shri Rama all the saints used to marry, they

41
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:42,349
used to have wives they used to have children,
they lived a very normal life. Only they were

42
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:50,169
saints because they were very highly evolved
people and they lived in ashrams doing the

43
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:57,639
work of realization and also other corrections
in human beings.

44
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:08,509
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
"He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

45
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:15,620
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic." So this foolish idea

46
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:26,780
of asceticism crawled in and then people became
very austere type, very austere. Nobody would

47
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,659
laugh, nobody would smile, everything was
very serious, absolutely, and everything was

48
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:44,470
done in a very dry manner. So many seekers
did not marry but apart from seekers many

49
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,410
seers and saints also did not marry and because
they had no balance, because marriage gives

50
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,960
you a balance, they became very dry people,
very hot tempered people, and we have some

51
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:05,960
examples of some rishis who are known for
their hot temper and their ascetic qualities

52
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,110
by which they could destroy anyone, make them
into ashes - in Sanskrit it's called as Bhasma

53
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:25,890
Karoti. So these qualities developed, that
is the time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri

54
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,980
Rama's incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

55
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:41,810
Sri Krishna's incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela. That's

56
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:49,620
why He's Leeladhar, He's called as Leeladhara.
He was the one who showed that everything

57
00:09:49,620 --> 00:10:00,540
is fun, there's nothing to be serious, nothing
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole

58
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:13,440
life is a fun. He gave this idea because people
had become so austere. And then also a kind

59
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:22,890
of a funny Brahminism started, like they would
not eat, they created a caste system which

60
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,540
started developing. The caste was determined
by birth, which was wrong, and they could

61
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:37,370
not eat food. Then the Brahminism started
growing up, quite strong, and these Brahmins

62
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:53,380
started dominating others. So Shri Krishna
came and He came as a son of a milkman (gwale

63
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:10,610
ki ladke). But they were rich milkmen, very
rich milkmen. Now that is the time, you see,

64
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:21,760
the whole play was brought forth, and the
play was quite cruel I should say, because

65
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:45,810
one horrible devil, rakshasa, somehow or other
used a lady who 
was mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother

66
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:54,080
also of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,

67
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:06,400
so it's all a play of the same. So He had
an uncle who was a devil, who was a rakshasa

68
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,000
and He was supposed to kill this uncle - see
the play, this is a drama all, just see the

69
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,350
drama as it worked out. He was supposed to
kill this uncle who was very powerful and

70
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,520
who was a devil.

71
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:37,080
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

72
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:43,300
He was very young, He was about five years
of age. And He did all kinds of pranks and

73
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:53,500
He did all kinds of leelas, like He killed
one snake, very big snake - a cobra - very

74
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:01,700
well known cobra. And also He killed many
rakshasas and rakshasinis with His power - in

75
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,700
a play. Just in a play, He used to do it,
and you must have read the stories about Him

76
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:17,240
- how He showed that there is no need to have
a big army of people as Shri Rama had - He

77
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:26,210
didn't use any monkeys or anyone, though Hanumana
was always, was sitting on His chariot. But

78
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:34,800
He never used all these outside powers. Only
whatever He had the weapons that He used,

79
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:47,870
to show that there is no need to use any army
or other people to kill a rakshasa. And all

80
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,480
was in a very playful manner.

81
00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:00,480
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

82
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:11,750
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

83
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:21,040
accept it because He was not supposed to know.
It's something like Mahamaya. But say all

84
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:34,110
the cameras are now giving you all the evidence
of the real Mahamaya, what She is like. But

85
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,700
one may try to show that you don't remember,
you don't have, you have no memory of it.

86
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,690
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

87
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,020
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won't be able to

88
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:01,260
stand, or they'll be frightened, they'll be
such an awe.

89
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:12,230
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person. Like in His childhood, He

90
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,840
was very fond of butter. And as you know butter
is very good for the throat. For Vishuddhi

91
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:26,890
I've told you many-a-times that on your tea
you put some butter and take it so that your

92
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:33,580
throat which is dried out will feel better.
So He was very fond of butter and He would

93
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:41,560
go and make His friends help Him, and made
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and

94
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,800
break the butter container and would eat all
that butter like a little baby.

95
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,910
So one day His mother said, "All right, why
did you eat butter?"

96
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,390
He said, "I never ate."

97
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,240
She said, "Then what is this on your mouth?"

98
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,030
He said, "This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

99
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,990
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

100
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:11,340
to that extent. Like "don't tell lies! You
must not!" No, there was no fun in this kind

101
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,650
of thing.

102
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,340
So He told her a lie. "See now, these people
have put it on my mouth. They have eaten all

103
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:26,400
the butter and now I am the one you are catching!"
you see.

104
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
So she said, "Really? Open your mouth!"

105
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,770
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

106
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,020
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth. The whole universe

107
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:39,010
moving in the Vishuddhi, the complete Vishuddhi
chakra she saw, and she just bowed to Him.

108
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:49,700
Then He says, "Why are you bowing to Me?"
as if nothing has happened.

109
00:16:49,700 --> 00:17:03,930
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

110
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:13,589
of understanding, and it's regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

111
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,990
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

112
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:24,600
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

113
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:37,170
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

114
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,220
are not attached to their children. They don't
love their children. They love their carpets,

115
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,290
love everything else because they can sell
it, but they can't sell their children. And

116
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:59,150
that kills the joy. So the children and the
parents are separated by materialistic ideas

117
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,720
that this material is more important than
their own children.

118
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,590
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

119
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:16,610
steal also. Now stealing is supposed to be
bad. Some, belongs to somebody else, if you

120
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:22,500
steal, is bad. But He was stealing only the
butter of His mother that He had made them.

121
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,780
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

122
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:36,590
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

123
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,030
very powerful. So He thought best thing is
to go and eat all the butter so that these

124
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:49,420
ladies won't be able to go and sell it. Also
if you see it significantly is this that we

125
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,770
starve our children, we starve our families,
just to have some money. Money orientation

126
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:04,910
is there, that you can go and sell your butter
to somebody. With this idea - everything to

127
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,810
be sold out, we have to sell out this, we
have to sell out that. Nothing is going to

128
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:18,270
be kept with ourselves. So the children are
the only permanent liabilities, so the children

129
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:25,550
are treated as if they are just burdens while
all other things are good because you can

130
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,560
sell it. So the whole value system, if it
runs down to money, then children have no

131
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,500
place in the family.

132
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:45,310
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

133
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,800
and they are to be looked after that way.
Of course they should be told what is dignity

134
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,740
is, how to behave themselves. But their little,
little pranks are to be understood and enjoyed

135
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,680
because only as children they can do pranks,
not as grown ups, so they should have that

136
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:09,910
much freedom to play pranks and to play some
tricks on you. Otherwise, they'll become very

137
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:17,830
serious people and might become ascetic. Those
parents who are very strict, their children

138
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:27,520
are never normal; they either are extremely
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down

139
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:37,680
and they cannot face life. So both are of
the same style because one cannot face life

140
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,610
another cannot be faced by life. It's like
this. Nobody can face such people.

141
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,890
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

142
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,110
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.
So children only care for love. They don't

143
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:59,470
know money. They don't know anything. So the
love that is you establish in your child becomes

144
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:07,430
very precious thing. So the system of Sahaja
Yoga is based on divine love and it can only

145
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:13,210
work when people are loving. If they love
money, if they love power, if they love their

146
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,230
reputation, they love this, love that, and
not their own children or their families then

147
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:27,260
they are absolutely losing a very big part
of the society and God knows what's going

148
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,140
to happen to these children if you do not
have love for your children.

149
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:39,960
In Shri Krishna's life, you can see various
things He has shown. In His, you can say in

150
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:49,690
His epic or in His biography if you see, you
will find how many facets of life He has handled

151
00:21:49,690 --> 00:22:00,630
with such beauty. Then in His childhood, then
He goes and kills the devil of Kamsa. That

152
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:08,180
too, how beautifully He does it. How He kills
the people who are surrounding Him. How He

153
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:18,950
knows their secrets, how they can be killed,
it shows complete brilliance and very beautiful

154
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:29,220
organizing the whole thing. Now imagine one
Krishna fought, one Krishna fought the whole

155
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:37,430
army of that Kamsa, how He must have done
it, because after all He's Viraat. And the,

156
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:46,710
all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands. He can do whatever

157
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,530
He likes. He can play around as He likes.
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it

158
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,610
is so easy for Him to manage all these things
simultaneously.

159
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:05,970
Then came His life when He became the king.
When He became the king He wanted, I should

160
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:17,740
say in a way that, He wanted to establish
people in dharma and He needed the help of

161
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:25,440
the five elements. So He made them into five
ladies whom He married; so He has five wives

162
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,420
but they are five elements, part and parcel
of His being. But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely

163
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:39,320
detached in His yoga, but He had, for practical
purposes we can say, five wives. And they

164
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:46,500
were sixteen thousand women who became His
wives. These sixteen thousand women are nothing

165
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:56,059
but His sixteen thousand powers because you
know His chakras they have got sixteen petals

166
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:02,280
and these sixteen petals multiplied by the
Virata's one thousand petals each - so it

167
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:10,200
comes to sixteen thousand powers. So these
sixteen thousand powers were incarnated as

168
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:17,370
women, were taken away by some horrible king
and He went there, fought that king and brought

169
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,740
these ladies.

170
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,780
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

171
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,220
think that there is good relationship. They'll
always think there must be something wrong.

172
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,900
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them. But

173
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,730
mother's position is different because mother
can have thousand children. But poor man,

174
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:49,100
even if he has one woman around him, everybody
will say he's a bad person. So He had to marry

175
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:56,200
all of them, so-called marriage, and these
sixteen thousand powers stayed with Him by

176
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,050
which He established our Vishuddhi Chakra.

177
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,960
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

178
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,809
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us - that's why we are suffering.

179
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:29,400
Let's see the right side Vishuddhi when we
catch. Shri Krishna's essence is sweetness

180
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,610
- madhuriya, madhuriya. And His power was
Radha. "Ra" is energy "dha," means the one

181
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:42,120
who has sustained the energy. And Her power
was, She was called as Ahlada. "Ahlada" means

182
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,860
joy giving qualities She had. So Shri Krishna's
qualities were that He was Yogeshwara, so

183
00:25:49,860 --> 00:26:02,210
He was the witness and sweetness. Now a person
who shouts and screams and talks loudly and

184
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:11,470
loses his temper in a very loud voice, or
who speaks very loudly all the time, they

185
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:20,330
all suffer from the right Vishuddhi.. So one
should understand that even when you have

186
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,650
to scold somebody, you have to just say, "What
are you doing? Why are you doing like this?"

187
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:32,980
Otherwise "I give you, oh do like this?" Finished!
Right Vishuddhi over. It's finished now.

188
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:39,320
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

189
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,290
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

190
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:53,050
one boy who was serving his parents. And his
parents were sleeping, he was pressing their

191
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,809
feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,
they appeared in the door.

192
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:06,010
But he said, "Now keep quiet. My parents are
sleeping so you stay there!"

193
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:13,870
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, "You stay on that."

194
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:21,240
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping. Now this is the thing is.

195
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:32,850
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

196
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:40,140
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi. So for that best is to take some

197
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:48,440
rest and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi
by stopping your talk. Go into mauna they

198
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,570
say, just don't talk. For some time if you
don't talk you will see that your Vishuddhi

199
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,760
will be improved, your problems will be improved.

200
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:04,320
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

201
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,400
It's all in one play. From the, we can say,
not from the stomach but actually from the

202
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:18,700
liver, the heat starts rising. It first goes
into right heart, as a result you might become

203
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,990
a very hot-tempered husband or a father or
something. You might get asthma, anything,

204
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,530
with that right heart. Then it passes on to
your right Vishuddhi. When it goes to your

205
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,070
right Vishuddhi then you become a very irritable,
hot-tempered person. All the time you shout

206
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:40,670
at someone. Nobody can talk to you. If somebody
has to talk to you, he has to use a barge

207
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:46,610
pole in between. God knows what time he'll
shout at you. Or maybe, I've seen many women

208
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,190
lose their hearing or men lose their hearing
when there is somebody who is shouting at

209
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:58,630
them. So shouting is a very bad thing for
others and also for yourself because, of course,

210
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:04,120
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

211
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:12,670
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet. But for others it's even worse because

212
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:19,670
if you use your anger in that manner then
that person might be just frightened of you,

213
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:26,660
might develop inferiority complex, might become
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots

214
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,980
or God knows what can happen to a person who
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

215
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,940
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

216
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:46,070
So from Shri Krishna's life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

217
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:57,790
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

218
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:09,660
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful. But
in modern times the other way round. They

219
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,679
have the music where the right Vishuddhi is
about to break or burst. I don't know what

220
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:23,809
sort of a music it is. When they listen to
this music, you see, then it excites, then

221
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:31,170
it excites you. It doesn't make you peaceful.
It excites you, excites you more and more.

222
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:39,970
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it. And

223
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:47,020
when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

224
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,230
more. Then they have to put something near
the ear to hear something otherwise they have

225
00:30:52,230 --> 00:31:02,610
no excitement. All the exciting, we can say
all the exciting cells become numbed. And

226
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:11,760
you have to really go in for tremendous effort
to create that excitement in those numbed

227
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,370
cells.

228
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:19,480
So it's very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

229
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:27,760
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain. So then you take to drugs because

230
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:35,130
your brain is numbed out. So you take to drugs
and when you take to drugs then you feel that

231
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,990
you are all right. Then again you feel that
this drug is not sufficient then you take

232
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,510
stronger drugs. Then you take more drugs.
It goes on one after another. Ultimately,

233
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:57,700
it reaches a stage when you are nowhere. So
it is all self-destructive.

234
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:13,360
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

235
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:27,220
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence. Those who think, who

236
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,850
are very dominating, who are talking in a
very dominating manner, whose right Vishuddhi

237
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:42,740
is catching, should become silent and should,
at least for some time, should not talk at

238
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,950
all. Maybe you might fix one day, say you
can do it on a ... say "I'll not talk on Monday."

239
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,190
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say "I'll not talk on Sunday."

240
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,590
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

241
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:07,809
they will talk the most!

242
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:15,120
And this shouting and then intimidating people
- you have no right. You have no business

243
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:22,570
to shout at anyone whatsoever. What is the
need to shout? After all, you are a human

244
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:29,350
being, another one is a human being. God has
not given anybody whether it is a husband,

245
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:35,320
wife, children or anyone. But I find even
these days children shout, the mother shouts,

246
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,580
the father shouts. If you go in the house,
you feel like running back because you'll

247
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:49,020
find, hear, nothing but shouts. So this kind
of a family system will rock, completely finish

248
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,990
that family and there will be no beautiful
relationship between each other and between

249
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,150
the other people.

250
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,530
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

251
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:09,319
at another. All over you go you find nothing
but shouting. Even if you take your car little

252
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:15,690
bit this side there will be a shouting, I
mean. For the slightest excuse, they start

253
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,230
shouting and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.
Now, for politicians, they think it's the

254
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:28,450
best way to shout because they can really
impress people by their shouts you see. So

255
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:33,460
they shout a lot, tell people this that. When
they speak, you should hear there's no sweetness

256
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,980
in their tongue, nothing of the kind. But
they shout and by shouting a person gets frightened.

257
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,350
"All right, you want the vote? We'll give
you but don't shout." That's how many people

258
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,510
get elected and become big and think that
they are very successful because they have

259
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,379
been shouting (laughter).

260
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:56,050
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

261
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:07,660
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices. For Sahaja Yogis it doesn't

262
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:18,940
behove. Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet
person to talk, extremely sweet. Now when

263
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:26,800
you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama as a person
who was a king, and then you have got Shri

264
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:35,010
Krishna who was a diplomat. So what is the
divine diplomacy? You don't have to shout,

265
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:46,840
but you change the subject. If you want to
bring somebody to a, some, conclusion - then

266
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,730
best thing is first you change the subject
and gradually, if you are clever enough, then

267
00:35:52,730 --> 00:36:01,210
you go on changing, changing and you bring
it back to the right thing. That's the clever

268
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,730
thing to do. Otherwise, just by shouting if
somebody may say, "Yes, all right, I'll do

269
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:14,109
it," by the time you are gone they'll say,
"Yah, I'll do it." That means something else.

270
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:20,240
So you see, he might say, "yes" and "yah"
anytime.

271
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,730
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person. That's

272
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,320
what I did also in Russia. I went round and
round and round and round and brought him

273
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,470
to the point that we have to be very independent
thing, and I managed it. That is Shri Krishna's

274
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:45,450
style. You see, because to face it. Supposing
somebody says, "Oh this is my idea; I've decided

275
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:52,070
to do this and that and everything," then
you should say slowly, "All right, now I would

276
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,930
say what you are saying is correct, absolutely
correct. I agree with you and what do you

277
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:05,090
think about the other thing?" something like
that. And then you should say, "Now, I can

278
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:11,540
suggest. But I would like to suggest," like
this, "if you can agree to it." You see, gradually

279
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:19,520
if you go and talk like this things can work
out and people can feel really that you have

280
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:28,420
taken time and you have spent that much time
and have accepted their proposal and things.

281
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,869
And they don't feel bad.

282
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:52,560
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy. Can you tell me? What

283
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:07,420
is the essence of this diplomacy? Is benevolence.
You have to achieve the benevolence of the

284
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:14,440
whole humanity. This is the essence of it.
If you are doing it, you are not doing for

285
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,220
yourself, for your gain. You are not doing
for the gain of any particular person. But

286
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:26,400
you are doing it for the benevolence of the
whole humanity. So once, you know this is

287
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,250
the essence, so what is the need to shout?
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

288
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,450
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

289
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:44,840
Like Krishna was asked that "You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

290
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:52,580
also very pleasing. Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."
He said, "how can it be?

291
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,950
These two things cannot be. Supposing you
tell the truth people may not like it, may

292
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,270
not please that person.

293
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,090
So He said, "No. It should be 'Satyam vadet,
hitam vadet, priyam vadet.'" That "Tell the

294
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,640
truth, tell for the benevolence and tell the
pleasing thing."

295
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:19,580
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time. Supposing

296
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,150
you tell that person, "Now don't go today
by plane."

297
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,720
He will not like it, "What do you mean? I'm
going to go."

298
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,530
"No please don't go. I request you."

299
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:36,350
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash. So he thinks, "This was good

300
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,590
because for my benevolence this has worked
out. So this is something so good." So immediately,

301
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:47,450
he feels obliged to you and he feels that
you have told him the truth by which it was

302
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:53,180
his benevolence and that's why he's pleased.
So in the long run if you talk something for

303
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:59,940
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence
of the spirit, then such a person immediately

304
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:13,820
thinks that we have really done such a great
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

305
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:22,220
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter. It will not

306
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,240
have any effect because Shri Krishna, which
is the deity, knows it. For example, a man

307
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,609
is coming to kill somebody and you know where
that man is hiding. He comes and asks you

308
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:37,090
"Where is that man?" Are you supposed to tell
him the truth "All right, he's there. Go and

309
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:44,740
kill him"? No. So what do you have to tell?
You have to tell him that "See. I'm not going

310
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:51,460
to tell you. I don't know. Doesn't matter."
Because what he is asking is unauthorized

311
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:59,460
is anadhikar. He had no business, he has no
authority to ask such a question. And he had

312
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,690
no authority to extract the answer from you.
Whether you give him the answer or not answer

313
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:11,720
is your right. If you understand that, it
is not for the benevolence for the man who

314
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,180
wants to kill, because tomorrow he will be
hanged, and not also for the benevolence of

315
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:25,790
the person whom he is seeking out. So if you
do like that then there is no problem. You'll

316
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:31,849
find most of the people will just like you
because they will know that you are sincere,

317
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,210
very honest, that you want to be benevolent.

318
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:43,359
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

319
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,990
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time. I have to also

320
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:56,540
tell lies little bit. But whatever I do you
will find out is for your benevolence, is

321
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:03,960
for your good. I have to tell you. I cannot
run away from that. I have to face it. So

322
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,010
you cannot run away from telling people what
you think is right for them. Specially those

323
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,359
about whom you are in charge. Like you have
children, you've got a family, you've got

324
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,400
other relations, of whom you are in charge
then best thing is that you have to tell them

325
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:30,130
frankly what you think and what is right.
It's your duty. Then people escape it also.

326
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,560
Many people who don't want to face their children,
I have seen, they'll give them toys, toys

327
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,320
after toys. They will not like to face their
children, tell them, "No, I don't like it.

328
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,290
This is not good. I would like you to do like
this and this."

329
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:49,580
So discipline doesn't mean, discipline doesn't
mean something very dominating of one person

330
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,750
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

331
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:05,590
of your spirit and the spirit of others. That
is what is the Sahaj discipline where you

332
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:12,330
do everything for the benevolence of others
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

333
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:18,530
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

334
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:26,030
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people. Because what They have done

335
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:32,780
is for the benevolence of the people. So I
would say now we have the left Vishuddhi and

336
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:40,420
you know very well that left Vishuddhi is
the lightning, in the lightning. Now what

337
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:50,270
is lightning? He just shouts and roars. So
a person who has got left Vishuddhi should

338
00:43:50,270 --> 00:44:00,849
actually become a person who can shout and
who can scream and who can, I should say,

339
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:07,349
expose others as She did. In the same way,
you have to do it. In that you should not

340
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:12,690
be afraid, you should not worry, and you should
not think "How can I do it after all?" But

341
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:20,150
mostly the people who feel guilty is a type
which has lost his confidence and the ego

342
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,790
has entered into the left side - it's a very
complicated situation.

343
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,480
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it's very important. Guilty for

344
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,400
this, guilty for that, it's just a myth. We
want to escape reality that's why we say we

345
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,460
are guilty. So you have to face, face it,
your reality. Try to find out what's wrong

346
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,359
with you and what's wrong with another person
and face it. That is much better than to just

347
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:59,510
say, "Oh I feel very guilty," and sitting
down, because Vishnumaya is nothing but like

348
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:11,260
an electricity and electricity exposes people,
she screams at people, shouts at people, she

349
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:20,280
roars at people. So if you have a left Vishuddhi
then you have to use these methods. I would

350
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,950
say a person who has an inferiority complex
should go to the sea and address the sea and

351
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,820
tell, "I am the lord of the sea, I am this,
I am that!" loudly.

352
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,369
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go - also

353
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:36,369
same way - when they try they'll become great
speakers. It will be a very good idea for

354
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:48,599
you to go and just to give a big lecture and
with that big lecture you can always show

355
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,619
that you are not suffering from any inferiority
complex but you are expressing yourself in

356
00:45:54,619 --> 00:46:03,670
a clear-cut way. So now you will see the power
of Shri Krishna is of the throat, of the right

357
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:14,130
side, where what is the power He has got?
The power is that He is sweetness. He has

358
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:20,270
the power of the shouting - or you can say
with which, the vocal chord as you call it.

359
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:27,710
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

360
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:36,650
a contrast. And the same thing happens with
Vishnumaya too. Now Vishnumaya is the potential

361
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:43,530
power in the, say, in the clouds, is a potential
one. But what She does is to scream, shout

362
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,410
and show Her existence, that She exists.

363
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:53,330
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

364
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,849
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

365
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:06,800
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well. So though She is the sister of

366
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,640
Shri Krishna She is in a way very much subtler
because She helps you in such a subtle manner.

367
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:23,380
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it - you'll be surprised My vibrations

368
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,099
are passing through this. It is bombarding
this and from here, they are going anywhere

369
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:34,030
you want them to go. You can put a computer
on the other side and you can computerize

370
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:42,160
Me. It is such a remarkable thing that the
one which is supposed to shout, scream and

371
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:51,430
roar is the one which is on the left hand
side so that it exists in the people in a

372
00:47:51,430 --> 00:48:02,250
potential way. In the people who are feeling
guilty, who are suffering from inferiority

373
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:10,640
complex, who are sly, who feel they are good
for nothing. She exists in them. See the contrast

374
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:20,150
again. She exists in them that Her power,
She exists in a person, or expresses in a

375
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:30,790
person who is not self confident. And then
She asserts Her power by which persons become

376
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:39,349
self confident. This is how Her working comes
in and that is potentially within us also.

377
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:45,940
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there. Any moment

378
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:53,460
we decide, we can become great speakers, we
can expose people. We'll be like lightning,

379
00:48:53,460 --> 00:49:04,250
we can roar. But normally we are not. So it
gives balance to both sides of people. But

380
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,320
in the center when you rise - the kundalini
rises - most of the people have their Vishuddhi

381
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:16,599
caught up, most of the people. So they have
to either see that they are not guilty or

382
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:22,490
they have to see that there is no shouting
- nothing - they are not aggressive in their

383
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:30,540
shouts. And, plus, they have to see that they
are completely in balance with themselves.

384
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:36,970
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

385
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,250
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet. Artificially. They have to take

386
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:49,460
out some money so they'll be extremely sweet
and nice. Such people are really going to

387
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:56,500
go to hell because they are using the power
of Shri Krishna in a very absurd manner and

388
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,630
for that, they cannot be spared. So those
who are artificially sweet are good for nothing.

389
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:10,619
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

390
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:23,700
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

391
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,550
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

392
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:34,830
who might be feeling that "Mother is saying
to me." I'm not saying to anyone as such,

393
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,880
it's a general talk. So what I'm saying is
that if you are a person who is a shouting

394
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,099
type, please bring it round and keep it in
check and take rest, give rest to your throat.

395
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:52,260
Some people are very happy if they are told
that "Today collector sahib is in rest." They

396
00:50:52,260 --> 00:51:00,160
said, "Permanently or for a short time?" Because
he's the one, if he's a shouting fellow, nobody

397
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,520
wants to see him. No one likes any person
who shouts, no one likes. Even the nearest

398
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,810
and dearest don't like it. Of course they
tolerate, is different, but they don't like

399
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,540
it they don't want it.

400
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,869
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

401
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:29,510
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

402
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:38,270
Shri Krishna's melodious music. Unless and
until we have a beautiful, sweet music in

403
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:47,099
our heart we can never be, never be good Sahaj
Yogis. I hope today's evening puja, though

404
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:55,700
has been rather late, doesn't matter, will
help you to think about it, improving your

405
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:04,220
Vishuddhi, working it out. And then to look
at the Viraat and find out what's wrong with

406
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:14,940
you, get it corrected - which can be done
by anyone - and see that you just have a full

407
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:21,260
idea about yourself, about your Vishuddhi.
And that's only possible, only again it's

408
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,770
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.
If you don't have a good Vishuddhi you can

409
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:32,280
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi
point only, you become the witness.

410
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,810
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point. So you have to be at the Vishuddhi

411
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:45,310
a witness. If you have achieved the witness
nature then you can see in your Vishuddhi

412
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:51,400
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with your
problems, with your atmosphere, everything,

413
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,580
and you will end up here only thinking, "Oh,
this is the one that is wrong."

414
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:03,230
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

415
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:11,320
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain. That's what

416
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:18,609
I told you that the fat of the stomach goes
in the brain. So Shri Narayana enters into

417
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:28,339
the brain and becomes what we call as Viraat,
Akhbar. And when He becomes Akhbar, then He's

418
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:40,740
the brain in the big macrocosm. He's the brain.
So people who worship Shri Krishna become

419
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:50,050
brainy people without ego. Their brain develops
and they have no ego about it. Egoless intelligence,

420
00:53:50,050 --> 00:54:01,339
which I call as the pure intelligence, starts
manifesting.

421
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:15,410
May God bless you all.

422
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:29,040
After this puja now you know that I'm going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

423
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,300
It's terrible. And from Finland to Moscow,
Moscow to India, India to Japan, and Japan

424
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:39,869
to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to New Zealand,
New Zealand to Australia. So this will be

425
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:48,480
like this everyday practically, I think. But
whatever it is I'm going now and now you have

426
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:57,970
some time. We have lot of time now in between
till I come in October to trouble you again.

427
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:04,320
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

428
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:12,200
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out. This is very important because I don't

429
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,430
need any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the
rest of the world needs it. But despite that

430
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,609
I'm working so hard. So you have to think
that "Mother is now gone out, doesn't matter.

431
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:26,609
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

432
00:55:26,609 --> 00:55:32,520
So please work out something till I come back.
I'll be back here again in October, then we'll

433
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:40,900
see what we can do and achieve further. But
let's see what you have achieved and bring

434
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:47,950
them to some conclusions, bring them to some
fruits. And that is what I'm expecting.

435
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:55,740
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

436
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,430
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much. I don't

437
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:08,300
know if you know the names of all the leaders
or not, but it is worth knowing all the leaders

438
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:18,700
of all the countries and paying your attention
to them and praying that they should be able

439
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:31,780
to deliver blessings of Sahaja Yoga to everyone.
Also they should be able to have visions,

440
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:37,359
to see what they can do and how they can combine
different countries and how they can work

441
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:38,970
out through their own countries.

442
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:45,660
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

443
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:55,369
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did. They worked very

444
00:56:55,369 --> 00:57:01,270
hard and achieved such a lot of things. And
I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis who

445
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:09,079
are with them, who have helped so much. Thank
you very much, all of you.

446
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:18,339
All right. In today's puja we'll have first
a Shri Ganesha's three mantras and then we'll

447
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:26,900
have hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna
- if they have. Have

448
00:57:26,900 --> 01:01:02,720
you got hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna?
Just wash My feet. Need not call the children now, it's very late.
