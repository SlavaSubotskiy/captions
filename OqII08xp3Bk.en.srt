1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,029
Today, I met a gentleman who told me – who 
is an Indian, that as far as Indians are concerned

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,290
they have come here to make money.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,290
Not to know God.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:18,160
So they are not interested in you.  And the 
other people here, they won’t listen to

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,160
you.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,460
They will come to your program and go away.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,760
I said- why?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,120
Because you can’t pin them down without 
you get some money out of them.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,040
(Shri Mataji laughs in astonishment).

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,410
I said, “how much are they going to pay 
me?” He said, “Whatever you like” You

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,910
must understand their psychology.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,950
If you do not take any money from them, they 
won’t be bothered.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,579
You see, he told me an American psychology 
which was really very shocking.

14
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,020
He said, they talk like this- “I have paid 
for this."

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,320
If they have paid for it, they will go though 
it whatever it is.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,510
Otherwise they will not go through it.

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,910
And it was too much for me.

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,110
I said- “I can’t believe it."

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,300
How can that be?

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,210
There are true seekers in this world.

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:09,299
Those who are truthful seekers will understand 
that you can not pay for what you have already

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,850
within yourself.

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,159
And this is what one has to realize that God 
has built you up in such a fashion that everything

24
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,440
is within you.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,870
You have got your spirit in your heart.

26
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,500
As I told you before and then you have got 
that vital force within you * or that divine

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,320
force within you called as Kundalini.

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,160
The true desire * This is the true desire.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,930
The rest of them as I told you are not true 
desires as they do not give you satisfaction.

30
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,640
So this is the true desire within you which 
has to work it out and when it works out,

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,790
you become yourself.

32
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,300
Means you know what powers you have, and you 
can manifest your own power.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,310
It seems very fantastic to hear that we have 
all these powers within us that we can cure

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,799
ourselves, we can cure others.

35
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:13,330
We can cure our mental problems and we can 
cure others’ mental problems.

36
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:20,340
We can solve many problems of money and other 
nonsensical things about which we are worried.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,440
Our priorities change.

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,940
We become transformed and we become collectively 
conscious.

39
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,180
So we can treat others and we can know about 
ourselves.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,530
Seems to be very fantastic but as I told you 
that you are made into this beautiful body

41
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,840
with great care and love in such a beautiful 
way.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,650
I’ll show you that.

43
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,819
Now all these centers exist within you.

44
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,590
You need not take me for granted but they 
exist.

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,730
And when the kundalini rises, she passes through 
all these various centers and enlightens them

46
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,730
and nourishes them.

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,220
It’s a fact that this knowledge was known 
to Indians, great seers of Indians, thousands

48
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,709
of years back.

49
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,030
But we had three types of practices in India.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,599
The first one was where people were in devotion 
to God.

51
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,100
They wanted help from God and they thought 
that by praying to God, by (meditating*Unclear)

52
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,540
themselves to God they will be able to achieve 
the advent of God.

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,590
So they were praying for the advent of God, 
that was one sided.

54
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,310
Left sided people as we can call it.

55
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,310
Who worship.

56
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:37,110
The right sided people are the people who 
thought that it is better to excite and awaken

57
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:45,840
the different elements by which we can be 
benefited.

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,790
And that’s how they tried to do “yagnas”(hawan).

59
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:56,140
“yagnas” means a kind of a ritual by which 
you can excite or by which you can use the

60
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,180
power of the elements.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,069
And that’s how they did lot of rituals by 
which they tried to overpower and they had

62
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:15,170
(unclear*) quite a lot of development long 
time back about…They say that in India we

63
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,749
had aeroplanes, pilot lessons aeroplanes where 
it was about eight thousand years back.

64
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:26,240
So, whether you believe it or not but they 
tried to do it through this method of exciting

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:37,529
or knowing the subtle side of the elements 
and how to use it for their own purposes.

66
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:44,610
And the third side (Unclear*) was where people 
tried to find out, Sorry! …(Unclear*) they

67
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,030
tried to find out why we are here?

68
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,569
Why God has created us?

69
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:51,969
What does he want us to do?

70
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,349
Why should we live on this world like this?

71
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:57,990
Because they realized that this is not the 
ultimate.

72
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,229
We have not found absolute.

73
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,680
And such people meditated.

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Through their meditative approach they reached 
certain heights.

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,779
They found out certain secrets about ourselves 
and they described all these chakras that

76
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,759
I am describing to you fourteen thousand years 
back.

77
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,180
It’s nothing new , the tact(*Unclear).

78
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:26,580
Only thing, I am giving it a modern connection! 
That all these subtle centers are within us

79
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,580
and they manifest outside   .

80
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,160
All the known plexuses and ductless gland.

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,860
For example the (*Unclear) the Nabhi Chakra.

82
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,060
This one manifests the (*Edited.

83
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,330
Part of the speech missing) We have the pelvic 
plexus and then we have the aortic plexus,

84
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,639
then solar plexus, then cardiac plexus and 
here we have the cervical plexus.

85
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:58,479
And here at optic chiasma, we have got a very 
subtle center, which we call as agya chakra.

86
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,949
Which controls the pituitary and the pineal 
and is placed on the optic chiasma.

87
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,050
In the cross of that.

88
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,839
So this is the center.

89
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:14,410
And the limbic area which doctors know about, 
is the one which is enclosed by the ego and

90
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,099
super ego of human beings.

91
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,009
That’s how we have all the picture.

92
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,860
This is the tree of life.

93
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,849
Now, the tree of life is ready, only thing- 
it is to be nourished.

94
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,550
And for that nourishment, that kundalini is 
placed there.

95
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,899
I am sorry, you can’t see?

96
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,059
(Shri Mataji makes a physical move to the 
side).

97
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:37,529
And this kundalini is nothing else but is 
the Aquarius within you.

98
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,659
That’s why it is called as the age of the 
Aquarius.

99
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:45,559
Many people don’t know, why is it called 
as the age of the Aquarius?

100
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:51,050
Aquarius means the water carrier and this 
is the one that is the water carrier within

101
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,050
us.

102
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,599
The sacrum, the sacred bone in which this 
power is there and this power is your Mother.

103
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,051
And when she nourishes you, you solve all 
these problems that I told you.

104
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:10,190
You solve your spiritual problem and ultimately 
you become one with your spirit.

105
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,449
It is a very simple thing because nature does 
everything in a very simple way.

106
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,959
As I told you yesterday, if you have to sprout 
a seed- you just put it in the mother earth.

107
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,849
What do you do?

108
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:22,849
Nothing else.

109
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:23,979
Mother earth has got the capacity.

110
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,849
In the same way, when this has to rise, it 
has to rise spontaneously.

111
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:39,369
Now the idea, you must clean yourself, you 
must do this and that…is not necessary.

112
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:43,309
Say when you are sitting in your car, you 
have to get out of it to correct it.

113
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:50,709
So first, get out of it, not only that but 
you get the light to see what’s wrong with

114
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:51,709
you.

115
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:56,520
In that light, you understand what’s wrong 
with you, you correct yourself so Nobody has

116
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
to tell you.

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,649
You correct yourself.

118
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,179
And by correcting yourself, what do you get?

119
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:07,610
You get an absolute being within yourself 
which is the spirit.

120
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,649
So now, the time has come for you to get integration.

121
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:18,339
The complete synthesis of all the religions 
has to come to (*UNCLEAR) but its not a mental

122
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,800
projection, again I would say.

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,729
It’s not a mental projection, I should say 
that all the religions are one.

124
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,460
Nobody is going to understand that.

125
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,460
It’s nonsense.

126
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,319
Because people say, how if all religions are 
the same, why are they fighting with each

127
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,319
other?

128
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,550
They are having wars, they had wars, they 
are having wars, they’ll have wars.

129
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:40,209
So how is it possible that all these religions 
are coming from one tree.

130
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:42,610
They are flowers of one tree.

131
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,240
How can that be?

132
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
That has to be seen.

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,269
If it is so or not?

134
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:55,740
When it happens, you automatically realize 
that all of them belong to the same tree of

135
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
life.

136
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,060
And these different destinations that you 
see are not actually the destination but are

137
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,779
the milestones in our life time by which we 
rise.

138
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,750
Now many people have a habit that they stuck 
on to one chakra.

139
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,449
For example, those who are hindus, will just 
believe in “Krishna” and nobody else.

140
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,720
Krishna is just here (Shri Mataji pointing 
towards the Vishudhi Chakra on her neck) he

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
came six thousand years back.

142
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
He is here.

143
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,740
Then some will believe only in Rama.

144
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Rama is just here.

145
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,180
(Shree Mataji pointing towards her heart chakra 
to show Shri Rama’s place).

146
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,140
Or some will believe only in Christ, Christ 
is here (Shree Mataji pointing on her forehead,

147
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,410
where her Kumkum is) Now Christ is just here.

148
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,100
He is the Gate, Alright! But he is not the 
destination.

149
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,480
So what is the destination?

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,500
Is the Limbic Area.

151
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,670
You have to enter into the kingdom of God, 
he said it.

152
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,670
He always talked of the future.

153
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,300
He said you have to enter into the kingdom 
of God, Holy Ghost has to come.

154
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:49,870
He said that you are to get somebody who will 
counsel you, you will redeem you, who will

155
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,120
comfort you.

156
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,170
And that is the Holy Ghost.

157
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,561
Off Couse he did not say that it’s a lady, 
because he thought that if I say it’s a

158
00:09:57,561 --> 00:10:01,519
Mother, they will be all towards his Mother, 
attack her.

159
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,000
And he didn’t want to do that.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,290
To loose all the drama of crucifixion.

161
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,310
So he didn’t say that it was my mother who 
is one of the powers of God but he just kept

162
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,329
quiet about it.

163
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:19,529
But you…As I said this afternoon that it 
is impossible to understand how people rationalize

164
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,360
that there is a Holy Ghost, there is a Father 
and there is a Son.

165
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,639
And No Mother.

166
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,439
It’s an impossible.

167
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:32,120
And you can understand it clearly that there 
has to be a Mother, who has to come up and

168
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
nourish.

169
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,209
Now you, (*Editted/skipped portion) who opposed 
Freud said it very clearly that it is the

170
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,250
Mother who is going to nourish us.

171
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,170
He even took the name of Kundalini.

172
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,680
He studied upto that point.

173
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,160
But the mistake was when he tried to talk 
about it, his knowledge was that of a person

174
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,930
who jumped on the stage.

175
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,750
Suddenly! And he is trying to know over the 
stage.

176
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,720
So it can be mistaken also.

177
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,290
And he got quite confused because he said 
that to get to the unconscious you have to

178
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,290
pass the subconscious.

179
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,180
And the other day I explained to you that 
there are four areas of unconscious.

180
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,250
Means from four areas we do not get any messages.

181
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,250
We are unconscious of it because we don’t 
feel it on the central nervous system.

182
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,140
Now these four areas I have told you before 
and I’ll repeat them again.

183
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,370
On the left hand side, as you see of the person.

184
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,060
(Shri Mataji explaining on the chakra chart 
various aspects) On this side means facing,

185
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
we should see the left side where the hand 
is like this.

186
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:40,290
Is the blue line as you see is called as the 
Ida Channel which gives the manifestation.

187
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,680
In the gross of the left sympathetic nervous 
system which looks after our emotions.

188
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,800
And beyond that is the subconscious and the 
collective subconscious.

189
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,439
On the right hand side, when we think of the 
future too much, plan for the future too much

190
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:02,199
then we enter into the area called supra conscious 
and collective supra conscious.

191
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:04,540
Now down below as you see, there is hell.

192
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,709
The collective hell.

193
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,519
We live in hell and we have collective hell 
also.

194
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,769
Above, on top your head, is the super consciousness.

195
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,990
Which is unconscious.

196
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,170
Just now, you do not feel it on your central 
nervous system so it is unconscious.

197
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,699
To make it conscious what we have to do is 
to, bring into your consciousness on to your

198
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,420
central nervous system the existence of your 
spirit.

199
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,730
Once that comes in your consciousness.

200
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,730
In your attention.

201
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,029
Then you start feeling the all pervading power.

202
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,629
The subtle power, which does all the living 
thing.

203
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,850
Like creating the flowers, like creating fruits 
out of the flowers.

204
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,600
Every sort of a living work is done by that 
all pervading power.

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,910
Now for that, what can you pay?

206
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,010
What can you pay?

207
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,029
That’s one thing.

208
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,290
One should understand that you can’t pay 
for all this thing.

209
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,339
This is your own.

210
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,570
It is within you.

211
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,649
I am paid for it already.

212
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:02,850
You can think like that.

213
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,029
And it is within you.

214
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,029
The whole power is within you.

215
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,600
You have to just get to it.

216
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,630
Now, I do not want to criticize any religious 
bodies as such but they are doing all the

217
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,630
upside down things.

218
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,790
You can see for yourself.

219
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,170
You’ll be amazed in London, people are selling 
the churches.

220
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,089
And they are having their pubs.

221
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,629
I mean after (*Editted/skipped portion) something 
of the same kind.

222
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:23,830
So what is the reason.

223
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,190
Now, what is the reason?

224
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,699
Not only that but in Indian temples same thing 
happening.

225
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,999
In mosques also same thing happening.

226
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:33,399
In all the other religions the same thing 
is happening.

227
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,910
Jews are having the same problem.

228
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,570
Unless and Until you are a fanatic, nobody 
is bothered about you.

229
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,790
But fanaticism is a disease.

230
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,699
Because they believe in one center.

231
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,089
One part of it.

232
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,290
I’ll give you an example, I met a gentleman 
who came from Iran about ten years back to

233
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,579
see me.

234
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,709
He was a doctor and he was suffering from 
stomach problem.

235
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,750
Stomach cancer.

236
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:02,370
Somebody told him in India that I may be able 
to help him so he came down.

237
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,850
He came to London to see me.

238
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,330
When he came to London, he asked me, “Mother, 
can you cure me?’’.

239
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,800
I said, “I can, but have a disease."

240
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
He said, “What disease”?

241
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,910
I said, “You are a fanatic."

242
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,910
He said “No."

243
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,420
I said, do you believe that only Mohammed 
saa’b is the one for you?

244
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,499
He said, yes off course; I do not believe 
in anybody else.

245
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:29,870
I believe..(Shree Mataji asked someone if 
they are recording or not) Any problem?

246
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:53,540
(As someone tries to fix the mic/wires, Shree 
Mataji says I don’t understand these things…laughter.

247
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,870
I don’t understand these connections.

248
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:07,069
I am absolutely ignorant about these things.)

249
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,939
So I told him, Let’s see now, if you believe 
it’s only Mohammed Saa’b I can not cure

250
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:12,939
you.

251
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,790
Clear you of your problems.

252
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,819
So he said, then what do you want me to say?

253
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:21,110
I said, you have to say that Mohammed Saa’b 
was one of the incarnations of the primordial

254
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,940
masters and there are many others who came 
on this earth.

255
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,990
For example- Abraham, Moses, some people in 
India like Raja Janaka, Nanaka, all of them

256
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,800
were the incarnation of the same.

257
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,820
He said “This I can not say."

258
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,559
I said, “Alright then! Go Ahead.

259
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,769
I can not cure you either."

260
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:43,319
If you are obstinate about it you go ahead.

261
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,160
If you believe in only one person, like Mohammed 
Saa’b who is angry with you.

262
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,300
Take it from me.

263
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,160
Because he can not understand this kind of 
a stupidity.

264
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,410
He never did that.

265
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,480
What he said was, all of them were prophets 
and they have come on this earth and only

266
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,459
he said that “I am the seal!” Seal does 
not mean that I have sealed them.

267
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,050
Means I am one of the samples of that.

268
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,019
I am one of the symbols of that.

269
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,220
And that’s what he said.

270
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,800
And they said he is the seal now, nobody can 
come.

271
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,360
How can it be?

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,610
When he himself has talked about resurrection 
time, that when the resurrection time will

273
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,360
come your hands will speak.

274
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,690
And there is “Assess” he called the kundalini 
as “Assess” and that resides in the triangular

275
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,690
bone.

276
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,639
All these things he says, he talks of the 
resurrection day all these things he talk

277
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,480
and how can you say that Mohammed Saa’b 
didn’t talk of all these things.

278
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,619
He did very well.

279
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,540
But people don’t want to have that.

280
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,200
They don’t want to listen to it.

281
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,970
They don’t want to understand it because 
they want to use it for their own purposes.

282
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,749
When they want to use it for their own purposes 
they have their own concept of Mohammed Saa’b,

283
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:58,220
about Christ, about Krishna, about Rama, about 
everyone they have their own concept.

284
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,139
And they want to live with that concept.

285
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,000
They do not want to get out of it.

286
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
Because its beyond them.

287
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,240
It is beyond them to get out of those concepts.

288
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,130
Because they are bound by their ego.

289
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,069
Ego, is one of the greatest myths we are carrying 
with ourselves.

290
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,260
And it make you absolutely stupid.

291
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,720
Is the most stupid thing that is Ego.

292
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,539
Ego is the thing which tells you that we do 
this, we do that, we don’t do anything what

293
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:27,320
so ever.  What do we do?

294
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,120
Supposing, a tree is dead.

295
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,390
You make it into a bench.

296
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,010
Alright! Or a chair, or anything.

297
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,340
Can you make a flower into a fruit?

298
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,350
Even one?

299
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,870
You can not.

300
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,390
So what do you do?

301
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,940
Its only stones, and dead wood you play with.

302
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,580
What living work you have done?

303
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Nothing.

304
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,750
Nothong! Then what do you do?

305
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,799
Except for making a chair for yourself or 
some sort of a comfort by which you become

306
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,929
absolutely a lethargic person.

307
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,409
If you make a chair, you can not sit on the 
ground.

308
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,899
If you make a bed, you can not sleep on the 
ground.

309
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:05,950
You become a slave of this matter.

310
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,740
Graudually you start becoming a greater slave 
and greater slave and ultimately you think,

311
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,490
Oh..you are the lord of the matter.

312
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,669
But the matter is ruling you.

313
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,669
Suppose the electricity goes away, what will 
happen to us?

314
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,190
Supposing we don’t get any petrol.

315
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,179
Suddenly, everybody will be (*UNCLEAR WORD) 
one day, electricity went off in New York,

316
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:24,230
then what happened?

317
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,000
So much we are dependent on the matter now 
and not our spirit.

318
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,940
And that is the trouble with us that we have 
to depend on our spirit and on that great

319
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,860
power of God who has created us.

320
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,870
Who is the one who has done all this living 
work.

321
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,010
And who is going to do greater living work.

322
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,029
We have to depend on that greater force of 
life.

323
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,860
That higher force of life.

324
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,250
And we have to say that, Oh Lord!, Please 
give us that we deserve.

325
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,809
And you will be amazed, how anxious he is 
to give you that great thing.

326
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:06,460
To give you that (*BENEDICTION) that is your 
right to have it.

327
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,750
Sahaja means that.

328
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,960
Sahaja means it is born with you.

329
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,179
It’s your birth right to get realized.

330
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,090
It’s your (TIME;19:21) birth right.

331
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,330
You have to have it.

332
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,039
But how many want to be realized.

333
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,740
They want to belong to some group they belong 
to this group or that group.

334
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,690
I don’t know what people get by clubbing 
themselves like this.

335
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,420
Which is artificial clubbing, you know.

336
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,010
I have to go in England, all kinds of clubs.

337
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,240
I am sometimes surprised, how they have clubs 
about.

338
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,150
Like the people who hold their forks in the 
left hand and the knives on the right hand

339
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,820
are one and those who hold the other way round 
are another club.

340
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,590
IT’s stupid.

341
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,620
And such a wastage of time.

342
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:55,030
They have conferences, meetings of a group....People 
are coming all the way from Australia, from

343
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:03,980
Japan, this that….and what do you come out 
of there(*UNCLEAR) what is there to club?

344
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:11,299
And this clubbing shows in every walk of life 
that we try to club under the name of something

345
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,330
nonsensical or something that is hatred.

346
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,840
When we hate others, then we club together.

347
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,961
Like we have to hate this type of people or 
that type of people.

348
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:26,090
This type of people are bad, that type of 
people are bad, and we have to aggress these

349
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,870
type of people or we have to protect ourselves 
from these people.

350
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,990
It’s all is hatred.

351
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,399
A kind of a fear.

352
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,399
All the time working.

353
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:39,510
While God has created you all beautifully 
to (*) off course there is variety.

354
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,529
Variety has to be there.

355
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:43,480
Without variety, you would look so horrid.

356
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,779
I mean, imagine everybody looking just the 
same.

357
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,649
You would not know who is a lady or a gentleman?

358
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,610
It happens these days, very common.

359
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:55,799
My experience has been terrific this time 
(Laughter) In programs, I call some gentleman

360
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,020
as a lady and he gets angry and he says No, 
Mother I am a man.

361
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,370
I said, I am sorry, see, I couldn’t make 
out.

362
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,370
You see.

363
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,370
The way you are walking.

364
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,260
The way you are dressed I just thought that 
you must be a lady.

365
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,460
What can I do?

366
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,830
(*Editted/skipped) just human beings.

367
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:15,210
He has made us men and women and children 
and everything to create the mood of variety.

368
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:22,789
And that mood of variety that gives us a special 
absolute as human beings.

369
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,140
Animals do not have so much variety.

370
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,630
Only the human beings have so much variety.

371
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,860
And the craziness also that we have is our 
specialty.

372
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,279
Like animals will never create an atom bomb 
to kill themselves.

373
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,760
I mean, Thank God they can’t.

374
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,240
But we human beings can do such absurd thing 
as to make a bomb just to kill ourselves or

375
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,900
to kill others who are our kith and kin.

376
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,330
So this is what it is that we have now reached 
a very precarious stage where everyone knows,

377
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,990
God knows what is going to happen.

378
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,399
Everybody is frightened and this time we have 
to know that as soon as we are transformed

379
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:06,320
we are looked after by that Divine power.

380
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:15,409
Krishna has said, “Yoga-Kshema vyamaham” 
when yoga takes place, I look after your well

381
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:16,409
being.

382
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:17,409
Kshema is well being.

383
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:19,480
So first yoga has to take place.

384
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,529
It is not before yoga.

385
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,284
Many people think “Oh we believe in God, 
Oh! We used to go to the Church, we used to

386
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:30,640
go to the temple, we always would worship 
Krishna, everything.

387
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,860
And we never got any benefit.

388
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,809
So one should ask- were you connected?

389
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,850
If you are not connected with God.

390
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:48,399
If you are not one with God how will you get 
anything that is your due?

391
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,450
So first thing is yoga.

392
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,269
Is to become one with the Divine.

393
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,260
Establish the connection and that’s the 
most important thing.

394
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,720
Many people ask me- what about “Hath Yoga?” 
In Hatha Yoga there are “Ashtangas” there

395
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
are eight folds.

396
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,020
Out of which the main thing is “Ishwar-Pranidhan”.

397
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:16,039
Ishwar Pranidhana is that you establish yourself 
in such a way that God is establish within

398
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,039
you.

399
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,130
Means- First is self realization! Then you 
know and it is logical.

400
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,730
That once you know your kundalini has started 
moving and you will know which center is catching

401
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,179
and what kind of an exercise you have to do, 
what kind of “Dharana” means meditation

402
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,179
you have to do.

403
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,940
What mantras you have to say and unless and 
until the kundalini is moving how will you

404
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,899
know which chakra it is catching?

405
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:50,190
And that is why, it is essential that first 
kundalini should be awakened.

406
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,250
Once the kundalini is awakened you start feeling 
her movement, you start feeling your chakras,

407
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,250
you start understanding all the blocks you 
have.

408
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,529
You start understanding what problems others 
have.

409
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:08,700
If you know how to cure them, if you know 
how to put them right you can make the kundalini

410
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,470
rise straight and then once it comes out and 
then you establish it.

411
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,620
You have to establish it.

412
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:25,480
Once its establish then only you will feel 
that you are absolutely there.

413
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,100
So the first power you get is of thoughtless 
awareness.

414
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:36,539
Which is called in Sanskrit as “Nirvichar-Samadhi” 
It used to take ages in those days to establish

415
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,539
even “Nirvichar Samadhi”.

416
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:40,419
But I must be something the way I am doing 
it so fast.

417
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,000
It’s like a jet.

418
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
The kundalini rises just like a jet.

419
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,899
So there must be something about me but I 
am not going to tell you anything about myself.

420
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:51,850
It’s better that you know yourself first 
and then you ask about me.

421
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,440
It’s much safer for you and much safer for 
you also.

422
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,500
So when the kundalini rises, she comes up 
through this center of Agya and when it crosses

423
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,559
through that time we become thoughtlessly 
aware.

424
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,059
Then your attention is stationed.

425
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:10,419
There is no thought in between.

426
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:11,669
Like a thought rises and falls off.

427
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:13,160
Another thought rises and falls off.

428
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,770
(Shri Mataji uses her hand to express it as 
a wave going up and coming down for thought

429
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:16,770
process).

430
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,240
You can see the rising of the thought but 
falling you don’t see.

431
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,559
In between these two thoughts there is a space 
and that is the space which is the present.

432
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:30,779
When the kundalini rises, what she does - she 
makes this thought weak or elongated.  By

433
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,450
that there is a space, that increases and 
you stationed yourself in the present.

434
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,059
You become thoughtlessly aware.

435
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,230
Again, I say- you are aware.

436
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,230
But you are thoughtless and you can watch 
your thoughts.

437
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,590
If you want to, you can create your thoughts 
if you want to.

438
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,130
That’s the first stage of kundalini awakening.

439
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,460
But when she crosses up here (Shri Puts her 
hand onto her Sahastrara) and she comes out

440
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,000
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your 
head then I should say that you have got your

441
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,941
self -realization in the sense now, an egg 
has become a bird.

442
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:06,780
But still, there are many things of the egg 
which are sticking on.

443
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,970
AS every bird has to through away the shell 
properly to come out or the Mother has to

444
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,110
work hard to through it away.

445
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,590
And once that is taken away then complete 
cleansing has to take place till the bird

446
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,899
is ready to fly.

447
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:28,299
Then the bird is afraid still to fly and it 
spreads its wings here and there but it doesn’t

448
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:29,299
fly.

449
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,559
So the Mother bird hides herself and calls 
the little ones.

450
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,799
After sometime, the birds spreads the wings, 
goes up, flies upto a point.

451
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,820
It thinks it is falling down, falls.

452
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,460
Again it rises, again it falls ultimately 
it achieves that state where it starts flying

453
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,480
very well straight forward.

454
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,610
When that is achieved, that state we call 
as “Doubtless Awareness” called as “Nirvikalpa

455
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,350
Samadhi” But in the olden times these were 
divide into two -two.

456
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,510
First was “Svichar Samadhi then second was 
“Nirvichar Samadhi”.

457
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,910
Means first the Samadhi means the enlightened 
mind.

458
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:16,139
So first the enlightened mind with the thoughts 
in then the second one was the thoughtless

459
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,500
enlightened mind.

460
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,750
Third one was as it should be only “Nirvichar 
Samadhi” but it was not so it should be

461
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,230
“Nirvikalapa Samadhi” means doubtless 
awareness they would have and enlightened

462
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,889
mind still with doubts.

463
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:41,179
And then the fourth one they used to say as 
enlightened mind which has no doubts of any

464
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,179
kinds.

465
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,019
Which is beyond (*UNCLEAR) but with all these 
four stages you get different powers within

466
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:52,809
yourself by which you start manisfesting the 
power of raising the kundalini also.

467
00:27:52,809 --> 00:28:00,679
Now, this is the thing one has to understand 
that, some people move slowly.

468
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,389
Some people move just like a jet.

469
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:09,210
Some people move slowly and steadily and establish 
themselves.

470
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,090
Some people move like a jet and establish 
themselves.

471
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,960
Some people move like a jet can fall down.

472
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,130
Some people move slowly and steadily and go 
on falling up and down, up and down, up and

473
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,130
down.

474
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,200
The reason is you have many problems.

475
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,809
Which you face after realization.

476
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,740
One of them is your health.

477
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:38,210
If you have physical problem that shows immediately 
you start seeing the physical problem within

478
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,210
yourself.

479
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:49,460
You start curing yourself and once the physical 
problem is handled then you want your emotional

480
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,780
problems should be handeled.

481
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,429
So you come to the emotional problem.

482
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:55,899
You start solving your emotional problems.

483
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:01,390
Then you go to the higher thing where your 
intellectual problems where the doubts start

484
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,809
coming in.

485
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:05,909
and that is the intellectual problem you start 
solving.

486
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:08,320
Once you solve your intellectual problems 
like this.

487
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,720
Like we had (*UNCLEAR..

488
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,190
Some name) first time he got his realization.

489
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,100
He is an intellectual very well read man, 
he knows all about it.

490
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,450
Today that lady asked me about some (Edited 
or skipped) which I never read.

491
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,170
See I don’t read books, I don’t have time 
to read book you see.

492
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,240
I am reading human beings only.

493
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,500
And she asked me for that book and I said 
I don’t read that book and they told me

494
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,160
its about doom’s day (UNCLEAR) stop.

495
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,429
Because you have read all about it.

496
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,970
I am talking about the resurrection days.

497
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:42,460
So, now when he got his realization he said- 
“Mother, you told us that you have got telecommunication

498
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,490
and you can feel the other people.

499
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,070
I haven’t had any information from my father.

500
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,630
I want to know how he is?” I said, Alright! 
Put your hands towards your father and just

501
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,630
think of him.

502
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,090
And then he said there is a piercing pain 
here.

503
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:59,903
(Shri Mataji showing the palm of her right 
hand right below the vishudhi finger and the

504
00:29:59,903 --> 00:30:03,700
soft area below the fingers and around the 
Sahastrara of the palm) I said see, these

505
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
are the centers of your father.

506
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,519
And this finger (Vishudhi) if it is so piercing 
then he must be down with bad bronchitis.

507
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,480
So he said, Really?

508
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
I said yes.

509
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,769
I said, Alright! You telephone to your father 
and find out.

510
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:20,679
He telephoned, his mother came on the phone 
and she said exactly the same sentence.

511
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,779
“Your father is down with very bad bronchitis."

512
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,780
So, he was amazed.

513
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,840
Andbut then he was convinced and that’s 
how he saw gradually it works.

514
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
It’s fantastic.

515
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
But it does happen.

516
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,450
So the doubt starting disappearing.

517
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,539
So then he rose to the position of doubtless 
awareness.

518
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,830
But it is not a mental activity.

519
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,090
It is a growth within you.

520
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,240
When that growth takes place then you have 
a great power that you can give realization

521
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,419
to others.

522
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:58,490
With the movement of your hand, you can give 
realization.

523
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,679
You can see what’s happening to others on 
your fingertips.

524
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,409
And you feel completely blissful.

525
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:07,700
Absolutely at ease.

526
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,500
At that point of peace where nothing can disturb 
you.

527
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,600
You are in your fortress.  You are just sitting 
there and watching the whole world like a

528
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,789
drama.

529
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:18,730
It’s a big joke.

530
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,840
It’s a big…you witness the whole thing 
as just some sort of a play going on.

531
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,440
And that is the state which comes to you which 
establishes itself and you become that.

532
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,010
Then you are no more (*UNCLEAR) or upset with 
anything.

533
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,360
As it is you are blessed.

534
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,690
Physically, mentally, emotionally, materially 
in every way.

535
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,779
But you don’t become Mr.

536
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,389
Ford because that’s a headache.

537
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:46,510
Satisfy and your problems of material wellbeing 
are solved.

538
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,100
Here we have somebody, who is sitting there, 
who had material problems (*UNCLEAR) problems

539
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,549
and he came from India and was very upset.

540
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:01,259
He happens to meet me, he knew me very well 
otherwise as my husband was Chairman of Shipping

541
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,259
Corporation.

542
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,470
He (*) he didn’t know that I was also this.

543
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,349
See you have a double life.

544
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:11,580
So he just met me and I told him that you 
have a problem with financial things.

545
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,969
He said, yes, how do you know?

546
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:17,370
I said, I know because your center is catching 
on the right hand side and if Nabhi center

547
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:24,159
is catching on the right hand side and left 
side definitely you must have material problems.

548
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,290
He said, that’s true.

549
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,500
I said alright.

550
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,669
I gave him realization.

551
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:34,750
I  just checked his Nabhi Chakra and you 
will be amazed to know that he started doing

552
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,750
very well.

553
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,750
Now he is a happy man.

554
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,029
He is a satisfied man.

555
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,171
He has got his family here.

556
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:41,330
He is a very happy person.

557
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,629
It works out.

558
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:47,780
So this works out in many ways and that’s 
how you start understanding it is in doubtless

559
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
awareness.

560
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,600
For this in “Hatha Yoga” of “Patanjali” 
is called as “Ritambhara Pragya”.

561
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,360
Ritam- bhara-Pragya.

562
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,750
Ritambhara Pragya means the knowledge of that 
power of Mother Earth which fills it up with

563
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,470
all the seasons.

564
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,320
You’ll be amazed how you will be helped.

565
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,750
You will be so much surprised, how things 
work out.

566
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,279
You don’t have to worry about anything.

567
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,950
Everything works out so smoothly that you 
are, as if there is a red carpet for you and

568
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,060
you are going on a magical carpet somewhere.

569
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,649
All kinds of problems get solved.

570
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:32,740
And you are amazed as you are on top of all 
these things and you can help others also.

571
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,009
The person who is a Sahaja yogi of a high 
value if he enters in a house it becomes auspicious.

572
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:41,570
The person get all the blessings of the auspiciousness.

573
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,629
I have seen people who have reported to me 
that such and such person came to our house

574
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:53,260
and since that day Mother, my wife got cured, 
my son got cured, everything became so much

575
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
better.

576
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,260
We are much better people.

577
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,549
We had lost all the money in the business 
but we are doing very well now.

578
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,889
So many people write to me.

579
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:09,860
Recently I received a letter, there is a lady 
who is a widow and somebody wrote to me, a

580
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,820
wife of a gentleman called MR.

581
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:19,740
Dalvi that Mother, your daughter such and 
such has cured my husband of his cancer.

582
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,400
He was about to die, he had galloping cancer 
and now I am a lucky woman to have my husband

583
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,860
back at home.

584
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,880
So these things happen.

585
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,890
So many such things can happen because you 
are a powerful thing.

586
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,710
You must have, just have the power to feel 
yourself.

587
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,710
That’s all.

588
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,420
If it works, it works.

589
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,550
If it does not work I can not help it but 
gradually it can be helped.

590
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,430
That’s why you have to come to the center.

591
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,950
Because it’s a collective work.

592
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,010
Now the time has come for us to work it out 
collectively.

593
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,750
You cannot just sit at home.

594
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,350
Oh! I have got Mother’s photograph, everything 
is alright.

595
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,350
No.

596
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,350
you all have to meet together.

597
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,910
Understand each other’s difficulty.

598
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,700
It works much better.

599
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,540
Supposing one person has a strong say, Nabhi 
Chakra another one has got a Heart Chakra

600
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,450
so when they meet, they supply the energy 
which is needed by integration.

601
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,590
And that is what has to happen.

602
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,980
At the last center, you have all the seven 
centers placed here (Shri Mataji pointing

603
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,840
towards her head to show the chakras.) all 
the seven centers.

604
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,690
(TIME: 35:16) and when the kundalini rises 
in that area (Sahastrara) then all the integration

605
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,450
of these seven centers takes place.

606
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,600
That’s how become an integrated personality.

607
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,690
Whatever you do, you do it sincerely.

608
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,550
You do not have a mind somewhere, you don’t 
want to do it but you have to do it because

609
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,760
rationally it is good.

610
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,040
It will fetch more money.

611
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,860
Nothing of the kind you do it because it is 
absolute.

612
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,980
Because you think that is the thing you have 
to do.

613
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,840
And that’s how you get the courage.

614
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,020
To stand up against all non-sense that talks 
of disintegration.

615
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,140
Talks of hatred.

616
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:05,590
Talks of wars and you become such a powerful 
personality that all those who come in contact

617
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,320
with you also have that peace within themselves.

618
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,720
They feel that peace and they also rise to 
that.

619
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,770
We have to have so many people like that on 
this earth to change this world.

620
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,400
And I am sure one day will come where it will 
work out.

621
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:29,350
Television is discovered only for Sahaja Yoga 
because on television if they allowed me to

622
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,180
ask you to put your hands towards me, I could 
have given you realization then.

623
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,000
Possibly! So this, what you call…a camera.

624
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,820
Is also for Sahaja Yoga.

625
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,610
There are many photographs of mine which you 
will see, is amazing.

626
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:47,350
See I was sitting in a school.

627
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:53,030
In a village school, just an ordinary school.

628
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,820
Outside, in a very small little school and 
talking to people.

629
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,150
Suddenly the rays of light started coming 
on me.

630
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:05,330
Off course, I told them (Editted/missing*) 
a great saint had lived.

631
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,840
Seven times, the light came on me.

632
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,030
I knew that.

633
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,610
Nobody knew that there was light coming on 
me but then I put my hand like that and said

634
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,240
“Bas! (means enough/stop in hindi) that’s 
all.

635
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,840
I laughed and said, No “bas! That’s it”.

636
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,890
Alright! And at that time it stopped.

637
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,090
But some lady was taking photographs.

638
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,130
She took seven photographs of all those seven 
poses.

639
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,130
One of them is here.

640
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,650
That one is not here where I stopped it also.

641
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,780
It’s a very nice photograph of mine.

642
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,550
So this camera is doing so much justice to 
Sahaja Yoga.

643
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:37,440
It is catching all that you cannot see.

644
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,260
And that is why, I would say that all modern 
science is for this communication.  To the

645
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,560
whole world the message that you all have 
to become the spirit.

646
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,110
That is the achievement that we have to have.

647
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,530
Otherwise all the rest of it is absolutely 
useless.

648
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,410
Absolutely useless.

649
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,330
And when today that Indian gentleman told 
me that Indians will never for God because

650
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,320
they are only interested in money when they 
come here and rest of them won’t come to

651
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,700
you because you have to ask them to pay some 
money for you.

652
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,620
I was really very much disappointed and I 
said, is this the level of human beings?

653
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,890
I don’t think it is so.

654
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,710
Hope so, it is not so that people just don’t 
care for money.

655
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,780
Money is nothing.

656
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
What is it?

657
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,950
It is just the dust of the feet of the Lord.

658
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:24,950
It is nothing.

659
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,950
It is nothing important.

660
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,950
But by telling all these things it does not 
work out.

661
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,590
Once you get your realization automatically 
you will become so detached about money.

662
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,150
Though living in the same.

663
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,320
I live now, like a….because I am married 
to a man who is in a big position.

664
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,610
I live according to what he has rewards me 
to live in that position.

665
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,290
But from inside, I am absolutely detached.

666
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,330
In the same way, it will happen to you.

667
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,760
You won’t be involved with (it*UNCLEAR) 
only thing- the matter has one value that

668
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,200
you can give it to others.

669
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,490
That you can express your love for others.

670
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,850
Today I was shopping.

671
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,390
Buying presents for friends, and things for 
sahaja yogis where the children are.

672
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,410
What to give them.

673
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,540
That’s a big attraction for me that we should 
buy some present for them.

674
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,470
And this is the thing one has to achieve.

675
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:17,050
There is nothing else out of this matter that 
you can except for this joy of (*UNCLEAR)

676
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,050
that you give somethings.

677
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,830
In the same way, people give to God also like 
they will give a flower.

678
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,800
Flower is the best thing you can give.

679
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
But when you started talking off money I don’t 
know what to do.

680
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,110
I feel like vomiting.

681
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,370
My stomach goes into funny condition I just 
don’t know how to tell you that it is an

682
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:40,260
insult to think in the term of human beings 
of God.

683
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,520
God doesn’t understand money at all.

684
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,430
Not at all! So please try to understand that 
even if you are not paying money, doesn’t

685
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,430
matter.

686
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,040
It’s your right to have your realization.

687
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,640
This is the greatest wealth you have.

688
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,710
Today you have your realization or yesterday 
you must have had.

689
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,570
You must see to it, persue it, be serious 
about it.

690
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,240
We should not be shallow people.

691
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,540
We should not be shallow at all that today 
you receive your realization and tomorrow

692
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,561
you forget about it and you do nothing about 
it.

693
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,210
it will worse thing.

694
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,510
Because when the seed is sprouted it has to 
become the tree otherwise it is absolutely

695
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,510
ruined.

696
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:21,390
It is important that when you get your realization, 
you look after yourself.  Go deeper into

697
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,390
it.

698
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,740
you can meet here we have a center.

699
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,150
I am leaving some people here for you to talk 
to.

700
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,290
Who are very senior people they’ll tell 
all about Sahaja Yoga.

701
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,910
About yourself, about your problems.

702
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,370
May God Bless you.

703
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,960
As Gavin has told you today that I have to 
go today because tomorrow they have fixed

704
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,850
a program at 7 o’clock in the morning in 
Los Angeles.

705
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,960
So  I am sorry, I have to leave today.

706
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,930
I hope you will be able to achieve what I 
have told you.

707
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,980
I will just go in for a little program of 
self realization.

708
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,710
Offcourse I don’t (*UNCLEAR) if fit works 
out.

709
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,490
Nothing like it.

710
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,350
if it doesn’t work out, nobody should be 
disappointed about it.

711
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:09,060
And one should be contented that it will happen 
if not today, it will happen tomorrow.

712
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,860
Yesterday so many people felt it.

713
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,820
and also today you should feel it.

714
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:29,570
Now, if you have any questions, you should 
ask them now.

715
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,490
What’s the time Nick?

716
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,680
You just put your hands towards me like this 
and close your eyes.

717
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,910
Just put your hands, both the hands like this 
(palms open) and close your eyes.

718
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,780
Put your hands on your lap so that you are 
comfortable.

719
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,440
First thing is you have to be comfortable.

720
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,240
Put both the feet (*UNC:EAR) parallel.

721
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Away.

722
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,140
Little bit away from each other.

723
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,850
Because there are problems on the left sometimes, 
there are problems of the right and if they

724
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,260
are little away its easy to handle.

725
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,300
Now the left side, left hand- as I told you 
is the hand by which you desire.

726
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Is the hand of desire.

727
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,200
It is the hand of desire, expressing the power 
of desire.

728
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,150
So keep the left hand straight towards me 
like this that the desire is to become one

729
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,150
with the divine.

730
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,680
Now the right hand, you have to use it to 
raise your kundalini.

731
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:31,210
First of all, you have to put your right hand 
on your heart.

732
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,450
Close your eyes.

733
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,110
Please close your eyes.

734
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:44,310
At the very outset, I have to tell you that 
don’t feel guilty.

735
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,790
Please don’t feel guilty.

736
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,370
You are in the present.

737
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,610
Forget the past.

738
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,610
Forget the past.

739
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,300
You are in the present.

740
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,890
Just now you forget what you have done, what 
wrong you have committed.

741
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:06,040
Forget it! and now you have to say with full 
confidence within yourself you can ask a question

742
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,270
to me.

743
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:13,620
Addressing me as Mother if you like, or as 
Shri Mataji.

744
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,690
-Mother, am I the spirit?

745
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,360
Ask the question thrice.

746
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:38,640
If you are an indian ask the question- “kya 
main atma hoon?

747
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:47,770
Maa kya main atma hoon?’’ Sincerely.

748
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:54,570
Now put this right hand, keep the left hand 
as it is.

749
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,600
Don’t open your eyes.

750
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,050
Put the right hand on the stomach on left 
hand side.

751
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:02,970
This is the center of the primordial master.

752
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,570
And your principle of mastery has to be awakened.

753
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:16,410
We call it as “Guru Tattwa” now, put your 
hand there and press it hard.

754
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:25,010
At this point- you have to assert because 
if you are the spirit, you are your own master.

755
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,570
So please say-

756
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,220
-Mother, I am my own master.

757
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,450
Say it ten times.

758
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:36,470
With full confidence.  Don’t feel guilty 
while saying that.

759
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,470
You are.

760
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,470
You are the spirit.

761
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,470
Sprit is quite intact.

762
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,930
(it * UNCLEAR) its never ruined.

763
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,760
it never does any harm its there, all intact.

764
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,900
Just say- Mother, I am my own guru.

765
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:00,590
I am my own master.

766
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,970
Please say it ten times.

767
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:13,990
Because this center has got ten petals.

768
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,580
Now raise the right hand on heart again.

769
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,640
Press it a little bit.

770
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:28,350
At this point, you have to assert now twelve 
times.

771
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:39,110
Saying that Mother- I am (*UNCLEAR) , I am 
the spirit.

772
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,110
Which you are.

773
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,110
No doubt.

774
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:49,870
You have to just asset it.

775
00:45:49,870 --> 00:46:07,750
Now, raise this hand higher, at the base of 
your neck on the left hand side.

776
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,750
On the shoulder.

777
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,750
Don’t open your eyes please.

778
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,980
At this point, you have to say- Mother- I 
am not guilty.

779
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,950
Please say it sixteen times.

780
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,930
Push it on the shoulder.

781
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:28,710
Raise it higher, push it on the shoulder.

782
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:37,980
And hold it tight at the base of your neck.

783
00:46:37,980 --> 00:47:09,610
Mother, I am not guilty.

784
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:21,770
Now raise your right hand higher onto the 
forehead.

785
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:25,090
Put your palm across your forehead, across.

786
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:32,520
At this point- you have to say- Mother, I 
forgive everyone.

787
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,760
Really say that.

788
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:42,870
Without questioning, please say- Mother I 
forgive everyone.

789
00:47:42,870 --> 00:48:28,210
Now only you can say without feeling guilty 
that, if I have done anything wrong, please

790
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,650
Oh Lord! Forgive me.

791
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,980
Anything wrong if I have done knowingly or 
unknowingly please forgive me.

792
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,930
For this you have to put back your hand on 
the backside of your head.

793
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,960
Please say that but don’t feel guilty.

794
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,550
Please don’t feel guilty.

795
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:56,780
Without feeling guilty you have to say -if 
I have done anything wrong, Oh Lord! Please

796
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,610
forgive me.

797
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:12,280
Now put right hand on top of your head.

798
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,280
And try to press it.

799
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
and move it clockwise a little bit.

800
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,080
On top of your head, where you had soft bone 
in your childhood.

801
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,420
Press it hard.

802
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,600
At this point I cannot cross your freedom.

803
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,140
So you have to say that you want your realization.

804
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,760
You just say- Mother I want my realization.

805
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,680
Please give me my realization.

806
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:48,790
Say it seven times.

807
00:49:48,790 --> 00:50:11,110
Now raise your hand and see if there is cool 
breeze coming out.

808
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:23,270
You can change over and see on top of your 
head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

809
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,940
Put your right hand towards me as you have 
put the left hand.

810
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,080
Right hand towards me now and put your left 
hand up and see.

811
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,080
It’s there.

812
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,080
(Mother smiling) see it’s there.

813
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
Change over.

814
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
You can change over.

815
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Put your right.

816
00:50:35,080 --> 00:51:12,570
(Shri Mataji blows air into the mic a few 
times) now again you can change hand and you

817
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:48,660
can see it is there.

818
00:51:48,660 --> 00:52:32,430
(Shri Mataji takes some water from the cup 
near her and rub it on her Sahastrara and

819
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,490
a little bit at the back on right nabhi) after 
a break of few moments….

820
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:45,400
Now, you open your eyes, I will teach you 
how to raise your own kundalini.

821
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:52,190
Can you hold it for me?

822
00:52:52,190 --> 00:53:05,920
(Shri Mataji asks someone to hold the mic) 
this hand, the left hand you have to put it

823
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,920
in front of you just like this before the 
kundalini.

824
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,380
Just like this.

825
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,910
You can do it at home also.

826
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,250
This is your own hand and your own kundalini.

827
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,810
This is the hand.

828
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:21,690
Now the right hand, you have to move it up, 
forward, down, backwards.

829
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,400
Like this in a clockwise manner.

830
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,670
Now let’s start, moving it.

831
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,750
one hand is moving up and another is going 
round like this manner.

832
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,720
Take it up.
