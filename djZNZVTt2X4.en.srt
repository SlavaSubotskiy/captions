1
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,625
Today we have

2
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,583
had to spend a little more time than normal

3
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,583
to get to the stage

4
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:47,375
where we could really worship the Guru.

5
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:57,333
When we worship our Guru,

6
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,291
we have to know actually

7
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,041
we are trying to awaken

8
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,083
the Guru Principle within ourselves.

9
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,041
It’s not only that you are here to worship your Guru.

10
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:20,125
You may worship

11
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,417
many-a-times,

12
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:28,041
maybe the vibrations would flow,

13
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:33,709
Maybe that you might get filled with that

14
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:38,166
and you feel

15
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:44,625
elevated, nourished.

16
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,291
But this nourishment

17
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,625
has to be retained within ourselves,

18
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:58,250
So always remember then,

19
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,250
whenever you are worshipping

20
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,333
any principle

21
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,291
outside, you are trying

22
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:16,500
to worship your own principle within yourself.

23
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:26,291
Within us as you know, in all of us

24
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:31,125
there lies the principle of Guru.

25
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:38,667
It’s very interesting to notice

26
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:46,041
the Guru Principle being drawn

27
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:50,500
beautifully round the Nabhi Chakra.

28
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:57,375
We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle.

29
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,709
You see Nabhi, and around is the Bhavasagara.

30
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,542
So this Bhavasagara

31
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:17,333
which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru.

32
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,458
So there are

33
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:31,709
hidden chakras within this Bhavasagara

34
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,709
within us, which are

35
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,000
to be awakened

36
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:44,291
and to be brought to light,

37
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,166
to be manifested.

38
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,709
As you can see that

39
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:03,667
the limits of this principle

40
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,542
are done by the movement

41
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,291
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

42
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,375
Swadisthan is the chakra

43
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:21,333
which gives you, first and foremost thing, is

44
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,667
the creativity.

45
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:32,333
A person who is a guru

46
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,250
has to be creative by nature.

47
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:42,250
If you are not a creative person

48
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,583
you cannot become a guru.

49
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,250
For example,

50
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,458
you are faced with disciples

51
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:04,125
with whom you have to converse.

52
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:09,000
You have to create

53
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,709
a word of divine magic

54
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:20,375
to impress on the disciples

55
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:25,417
or the people who are attracted towards you as gurus,

56
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,041
to show that

57
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:37,125
you have much more divine magic than them.

58
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,542
If you are a very mundane type of a person,

59
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,583
very ordinary,

60
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,542
cannot create

61
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:56,291
a beautiful couplet or a beautiful sentence,

62
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,667
or a humor or a joke,

63
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:09,375
or a beautiful painting

64
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:16,000
or a beautiful tapestry

65
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,709
or a beautiful house;

66
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,625
if you lack in creativity

67
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:25,417
you will lack in your Guru Principle,

68
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,583
because a guru has to create

69
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,166
out of ordinary people

70
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,250
something extraordinary.

71
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:44,500
He should be able to create

72
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,542
a new personality out of

73
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,125
personality which is decaying.

74
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:13,000
So the first principle you have to understand within yourself,

75
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,583
that you should be able to create

76
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,625
a new personality in a person.

77
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:29,041
So how do we do it?

78
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:34,166
Of course you have got powers to raise the Kundalini,

79
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:39,709
you have got powers to cure people,

80
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:45,333
you have got powers to talk big or talk small.

81
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,709
Despite all that,

82
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:54,417
if you cannot create a new personality

83
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:58,375
out of the persons with whom you are dealing,

84
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,500
then you are not a guru.

85
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:05,333
And the new personality has to be

86
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,125
a special personality of very unique

87
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:15,709
combination of compassion and dynamism.

88
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,542
So it is important

89
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:30,125
that in your creativity

90
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:36,709
you have to use the energy of compassion.

91
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:42,083
You can only mold people through compassion

92
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,500
and never through anger,

93
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
never through suppression,

94
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,625
never through showing off

95
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,709
your powers of gurudom.

96
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,083
Unless and until you handle the situation

97
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:06,083
and the personality very carefully,

98
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,375
showing all the respect,

99
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,500
showing all the concern

100
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,542
and all the love

101
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,542
for the person whom you are giving realization.

102
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:26,000
Just showing off that you are a great guru,

103
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:30,041
it will only create a kind of a fear about you,

104
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:34,542
and after some time people would not like to see your faces.

105
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:44,208
So the most important thing about

106
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:50,709
Guru Principle is that you have to create.

107
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,333
Many people get realization, all right,

108
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,208
they get realization

109
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:02,333
and then they stay in some ashrams maybe.

110
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,709
They come to pujas,

111
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,041
they listen to music, they may dance,

112
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:15,041
they laugh, they’re collective,

113
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,208
but still their Guru Principle is not awakened

114
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,458
unless and until they have created

115
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:27,250
many, many more Sahaja yogis, Sahaja yogis.

116
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:34,625
So the vision of a guru should be,

117
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,041
“How many Sahaja yogis I am going to create?

118
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,250
How am I going to use this creativity

119
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,625
to create more Sahaja yogis?”

120
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:54,417
So the basis or the essence of the Swadisthana Chakra,

121
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:57,291
though is aesthetics,

122
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:01,625
the force and the energy of Swadisthana Chakra

123
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,333
is attention.

124
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,709
If you have a wobbly attention,

125
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:13,625
if your attention is one minute here, one minute there;

126
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:18,542
if you have an attention by which you just can criticize others

127
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,500
and cannot see your own faults;

128
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,625
if you have an attention by which

129
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:31,417
you show people that you are a frivolous, nonsensical person,

130
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:40,000
then your Guru Principle is wasted.

131
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:45,083
It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted,

132
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,583
and your Guru’s job is also wasted.

133
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,417
Minimum of minimum, first the attention has to be pure.

134
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:07,125
But pure attention doesn't mean harshness,

135
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,458
it doesn't mean asceticism,

136
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,583
it doesn't mean disciplining your eyes

137
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:17,542
like a blinkers of horse,

138
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:20,667
but in all freedom

139
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,709
your attention to be concentrated.

140
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,500
Where do we pay our attention the most?

141
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,417
If we are honest we can think on human level

142
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,709
we pay our attention to our children,

143
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:43,709
to our wife, to our husbands, to our family,

144
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:49,417
the relationships which are with love.

145
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:55,542
So when your attention

146
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,417
has got

147
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,291
the compassion

148
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:11,208
and the love for another person,

149
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:17,125
then only you can work out the realization of others.

150
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,709
If you have to work out the realization of others,

151
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:27,083
it has to be an intense love

152
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,417
for another person.

153
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:35,125
If you don’t have that intensity,

154
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:39,125
you are just moving your hands raising the kundalini

155
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:43,166
because your Mother has given you powers, and it’s finished off.

156
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:47,041
That intensity of love

157
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,667
can only give you success

158
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,291
with your pure attention,

159
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:58,625
and I think the pure attention can only love.

160
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,333
Impure attention cannot love,

161
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,542
because all impure attention is self-oriented,

162
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,041
I-oriented.

163
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:15,500
They are not “self” in the sense “spiritual-oriented.”

164
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:23,583
But the idea that spirituality is love,

165
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:28,208
it seems to be a new idea for many people.

166
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:34,166
They think spirituality means a person who is just

167
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:38,625
absolutely dry like a beanstalk

168
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,041
and

169
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,041
nobody can go near that person,

170
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,709
nobody can communicate

171
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:55,458
with such a person because that person is “too pure.”

172
00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:01,166
If the soap cannot cleanse your body,

173
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:04,583
what's the use of having the soap?

174
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:10,250
If the soap is afraid to come near you,

175
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,583
then it’s better not to be called as soap.

176
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:20,000
So we come to the point

177
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:26,542
that the creativity, if it is our aim, lakshya,

178
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:32,000
for that the attention we should purify,

179
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:41,291
and to be purified with love, with compassion.

180
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:47,709
And the same attention when it is filled with love and compassion

181
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,583
it gives you dynamism, it gives you strength,

182
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:57,417
it's untiring zeal you get.

183
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:05,583
And the joy of seeing your reflection into another person

184
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,709
is very beautiful.

185
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,667
No words can describe it.

186
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:16,291
Actually when you give realization to another person,

187
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:21,083
what you try to see is your image in that person,

188
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:24,583
as if out of an ordinary glass

189
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,041
you are making it into a beautiful mirror

190
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:31,250
and then you want to see that.

191
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:34,375
That is how you create,

192
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:39,333
you create your own reflections and

193
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:45,542
through the cleansing of the reflectors,

194
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:51,583
once you understand that without creativity

195
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,041
this Guru Puja is useless for you.

196
00:36:56,417 --> 00:37:00,458
If you just live for yourself, for your family,

197
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:05,709
for your husband or just for an ashram,

198
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,583
then you have not expanded at all,

199
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:13,709
you have not done any duty towards your Guru.

200
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:23,375
Of course as soon as you take to this principle

201
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,250
you develop so many qualities within you.

202
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,041
The first you develop is wisdom,

203
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:35,500
because you realize where you are going wrong,

204
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:40,709
why this is not working out, why there's a problem,

205
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:44,625
why your creativity doesn't act.

206
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:50,125
It becomes evident to you, obvious to you

207
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:53,166
and you start learning;

208
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:58,083
and wisdom comes to you, and you understand.

209
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:02,041
Wisdom is when you realize your mistakes

210
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,709
and rectify them,

211
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,542
and with that you develop the balance,

212
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,333
the understanding

213
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,041
how to deal with another personality.

214
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:22,375
I always tell the story of a car,

215
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:27,291
that there's an accelerator and also there's a brake.

216
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:32,041
You have to use first both of them without understanding what is it,

217
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,500
still you are not a guru,

218
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,458
you are not even a driver.

219
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:41,458
Then when you know then you automatically drive;

220
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:46,333
then you are a driver, but still the master is sitting behind.

221
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:49,625
So now you have to become the master,

222
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:54,083
and when you become the master you can balance the vehicle

223
00:38:54,250 --> 00:39:00,458
and you can see the driver, accelerator and also the brake.

224
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,333
And you can manage it just in a very simple manner.

225
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,500
So this Guru Principle is limited,

226
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:17,625
and goes on increasing its limitations

227
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,583
like the horizon.

228
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:29,417
As you start growing into more creativity,

229
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,291
the more people you create.

230
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:38,583
And the central point of this one is the Nabhi,

231
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,083
is the center which

232
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:46,166
like a big pivotal point

233
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:51,041
on which the whole of this movement takes place.

234
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,250
Nabhi Chakra as you know,

235
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,458
you get it from your mother to begin with.

236
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:04,542
So a guru has to be the mother,

237
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,375
he must have the qualities of the mother

238
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,709
not the modern mothers, but in the real sense of the word.

239
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:20,417
That is, a guru has to love her children

240
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:26,250
and has to have strength and courage

241
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:29,041
to correct her children.

242
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:33,500
And the earnest desire should be

243
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,583
to put the children onto proper lines

244
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:40,250
to guide them and to help them to rise.

245
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:46,125
So the first nourishment comes to us

246
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:50,667
even when we are in the womb of the mother,

247
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:54,500
through the mother; and so

248
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,041
you are the mother though you may be a man or a woman,

249
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:03,041
but in quality you are the mother.

250
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:07,458
And whatever you think or whatever you do

251
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:12,125
has an effect on the child.

252
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,542
The way you behave, the way you talk,

253
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,667
the way you live, everything has a bearing

254
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:25,250
on the development of the child.

255
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,250
In the same way when,

256
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,250
supposing a Sahaja yogi who is trying to give realization

257
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:38,250
is a hypocritical person, if he's a wrong type of a person,

258
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:42,166
if he does not respect his own Guru,

259
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:47,542
the children behave the same manner

260
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:51,291
and they take to wrong things much faster,

261
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,250
they see to wrong things first.

262
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:59,208
So you have to be perfect in your behavior

263
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,250
towards your own Guru,

264
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:08,083
you have to respect your own Guru in a full way.

265
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:12,041
Complete surrender to your own Guru is important;

266
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:16,166
then they will see how you have treated your own Guru,

267
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,542
and that is how they will treat you.

268
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:24,166
If you don’t treat your Guru with that respect,

269
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,542
with that understanding,

270
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,125
with that surrendering,

271
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:33,375
then don't expect your children

272
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:38,500
or the people whom you are guiding are going to respect you.

273
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:43,333
So this Guru Principle within us has to be

274
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:48,375
like a great sage or a great seer,

275
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:53,542
who is above the normal mundane people

276
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,041
and sees the things in a proper perspective,

277
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,625
and delivers

278
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,625
a proper understanding

279
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:10,166
of all this perspective he sees,

280
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,041
to his disciples,

281
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:17,083
doesn't give them distorted or wrong ideas.

282
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:28,166
Now one may say that, “Mother, how is it, that the love

283
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,125
we can express and also tell them the truth?”

284
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:41,125
You have to look after the benevolence – hitha.

285
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:47,709
You have to look after the benevolence of your disciple.

286
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,375
It may appear that

287
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:55,041
he may not like what you are telling that person today,

288
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,583
but a day will come when he will think

289
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:02,250
“Thank God your Guru has corrected you

290
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,125
and has put you on the right path.”

291
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:09,625
If the goal of the disciple is not to ascend,

292
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:15,208
is just to be there for some sort of a purpose,

293
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:19,375
then it’s better not to have such disciples.

294
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,667
Not to have anyone of this kind

295
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:28,000
who are not there for their own ascent,

296
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:35,500
but for other gains, which are absolutely of no avail.

297
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:46,417
This question arises sometimes, how to love?

298
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,166
It’s a very funny question

299
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:54,166
that we don't know how to love human beings.

300
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,083
We can love our things, we can love our useless things,

301
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:05,041
we can love some sort of a beautiful scenery

302
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,083
because it gives us joy.

303
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,166
We can love some

304
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,542
nice restaurant because you can get good food there,

305
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:18,291
or some sort of a thing which is of a very baser nature.

306
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,083
But love for love’s sake is this,

307
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:32,083
that when you really love for love’s sake,

308
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,125
then you try to put

309
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:40,417
or implant that love into somebody else,

310
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:47,333
that you make another person as loveable as you are.

311
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:53,291
So the whole system becomes different if you understand

312
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:58,041
that we have to base all our progress,

313
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,625
all our love, all our movements, all our behavior,

314
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:06,375
all our understanding on love.

315
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:10,041
Otherwise your Guru Principle is extremely weak,

316
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:14,000
and after some time you will find you are just standing

317
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,458
out of the shores of Sahaja Yoga.

318
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,500
Anybody who is attached or biased and has conditionings

319
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:31,125
cannot become a guru, cannot;

320
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,500
because even if he becomes, so-called,

321
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,542
all those things will be reflected in that person.

322
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:43,709
Or say if he is very full of ego, thinks no end of himself

323
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:47,208
and thinks that, “I am a great guru,”

324
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:51,083
that ego also would be expressed.

325
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:54,417
Supposing such a guru talks too much,

326
00:46:55,625 --> 00:47:01,083
also they find the disciple the same style.

327
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:05,417
If he is a quiet type, you find the disciple the same style.

328
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,458
So we reach a conclusion that first we must develop

329
00:47:10,709 --> 00:47:13,667
our own Guru Principle.

330
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:22,542
If we cannot develop that, it is no use doing any Guru Puja

331
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:28,417
because it is just temporary, it's not going to help you much,

332
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:33,166
unless and until you really decide

333
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:39,083
that you are going to nourish

334
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:44,083
and develop and establish your Guru Principle.

335
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,083
So today when you are worshipping Me as the Guru,

336
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,250
you must know that any amount of My talking,

337
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:59,000
any amount of My giving you blessings or anything

338
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:02,208
is not going to work out, unless and until

339
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:08,500
we really develop our own Guru Principle, and the depth.

340
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:13,583
Because a guru

341
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:19,667
makes his disciple cross the Bhavasagara,

342
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:22,375
he's like the boat

343
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,709
who takes his disciples and crosses

344
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,250
with love and with proper direction.

345
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,250
That has to be with all of you.

346
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:43,500
As it is you are all realized souls

347
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,667
and as I have told you, you are all angels.

348
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:50,500
But if you do not establish your Guru Principle,

349
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:56,417
you know of angels how they have fallen down and gone forever.

350
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,208
So be careful: it’s easy to be an angel

351
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,083
but difficult to maintain it.

352
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,583
It is difficult to be the Gods and Goddesses,

353
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:12,166
but easy to maintain it.

354
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:21,500
So all of you are here. I’m very happy to see

355
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:25,333
that you have come to worship Me as your Guru.

356
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:30,542
And I would expect that My children

357
00:49:31,041 --> 00:49:34,333
are after My own image.

358
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:38,500
That My image should be such that My children

359
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:43,041
should feel that oneness with My image,

360
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:48,083
and I should be a proud Mother of so many children

361
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,291
who have come from so many countries.

362
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,417
May God bless you all.

363
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:10,041
Now with so many people here, so many children here,

364
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:16,166
we can have all the children just to wash My feet,

365
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:19,125
and after that we'll need some girls

366
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,125
who are above sixteen years

367
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,458
to twenty-one years, we can say.

368
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:32,375
And then some ladies

369
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:36,041
for the purpose of

370
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:43,500
worshipping Shakti, the Goddess.

371
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:48,083
Without the Shakti nothing can be done.

372
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:55,458
So first the children have to come up just to wash the feet.

373
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:24,250
And I hope the world leaders will be here also.

374
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,250
They are in the image of gurus now.

375
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:33,125
And the leaders have to be something special.

376
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,083
You are not a leader

377
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:40,583
if you are such an ordinary, mundane type of a person.

378
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:20,667
Now, where are the musicians?

379
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,417
Where are the musicians?

380
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,083
All right.

381
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,667
So you have to first say the Atharva Sheersha,

382
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:40,583
and then you have to sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

383
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:45,166
or maybe any other thing that you know of Ganesha.
