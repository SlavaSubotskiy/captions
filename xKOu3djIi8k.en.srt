00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:46,698
1995-08-24 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

2
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:51,910
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:01:54,824 --> 00:02:01,713
At the very outset, I have to say truth is what it is.

4
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:07,691
You cannot change it; you cannot transform it.

5
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:14,059
You cannot describe it, but you have to experience it.

6
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:22,827
Whatever I am going to tell you here today,

7
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:27,821
you need not take it for granted.

8
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:34,741
We have had lots of problems with blind faith.

9
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:39,312
So, whatever I am saying, if it is proved,

10
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:43,826
then you have to accept it.

11
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:48,540
Because it is for your benevolence,

12
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:54,895
for the benevolence of your family, benevolence of your country

13
00:02:55,096 --> 00:03:00,382
and benevolence of the whole World.

14
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:12,106
If you see in modern times, people are very restless.

15
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,919
And there is no peace within.

16
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:23,281
This restlessness starts when you try to find the truth.

17
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,021
You may not be aware of it.

18
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:32,104
But it exists.

19
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:39,327
I am very happy to see so many people here in Brazil,

20
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:44,775
in Rio, who are seeking the truth.

21
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:54,244
At the very outset, again, I would
like to tell you what is the truth.

22
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:59,031
The first thing is when you say this is my body,

23
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:02,626
these are my hands, this is my intelligence,

24
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:07,788
we talk of ‘my, my, my!’

25
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:12,824
But who is the owner of this 'I'.

26
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:18,314
This owner is your spirit.

27
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:24,310


28
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:29,154
Actually, you are not this body, this mind, you are not your emotions,

29
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:30,094
your intelligence, you are not your ego and your conditionings

30
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:35,392
but you are pure spirit.

31
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:39,252
Unless and until you become,

32
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:47,790
unless and until you become the
spirit, you are going to be restless.

33
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:54,454
That is what Christ has said, that you have to be born again.

34
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:02,245
It is not like branding yourself "I am
born again", but it’s an experience.

35
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:06,448
And you become the spirit.

36
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:12,863
And you get all the powers of the spirit.

37
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:18,494
There is another truth, which we have to know about.

38
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:24,946
You see all this beautiful flowers, it’s a miracle.

39
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:31,240
But they take it, take them for granted, you take them for granted.

40
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,865
And we never think how they have been created.

41
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:44,076
We don’t know anything about the living process.

42
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,303
For example, if you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

43
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,288
he’ll say it is an autonomous nervous system.

44
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:51,146
So, you can ask who is this auto?

45
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:56,094
In the same way, I have to tell you that

46
00:06:56,295 --> 00:07:03,480
there is all pervading power of divine love,

47
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:07,982
which is a subtle energy.

48
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:12,068
Which does all the living work.

49
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:20,233
It has also done our evolution and we have come to this human level.

50
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:26,296
But at this human level, we live in a world which is relative,

51
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:30,570
it is not absolute.

52
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:36,622
Why we have to know the absolute truth?

53
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:41,709
Once we have an absolute truth, then there will be no quarrel,

54
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,962
no fights, no wars.

55
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:55,200
And all of them, all of you, will know the same truth.

56
00:07:55,401 --> 00:08:00,505
This is what has happened so far that everybody thinks

57
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:03,455
this is the truth and another one thinks this is the truth,

58
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:07,593
and they are just fighting.

59
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:13,980
No religion is exclusive, you should understand this point.

60
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:20,995
When Christ came, He talked about Abraham and about Moses.

61
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:26,167
So it was not exclusive religion He established.

62
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:30,071
Then came Mohammed Sahib, he talked about Abraham,

63
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:37,835
about Moses, about Christ, also about
the Mother of Christ with great respect.

64
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:42,935
So, Islam is also not an exclusive religion.

65
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,870
The growth of spiritual life is described in every incarnation like that.

66
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:57,095
But now we are fighting in the name of God.

67
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:03,254
Not only that, but among the Christians, among the Muslims,

68
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:08,881
among the Jews, they are fighting among each other.

69
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,155
But once you know the absolute truth,

70
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:17,082
then you realize that all these religions came on this Earth,

71
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:22,740
as beautiful fowers of one tree of spirituality,

72
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:26,733
at different times.

73
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:34,918
And now we have plucked the flowers
and fighting with the dead flowers,

74
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,658
bringing bad name to all those great incarnations

75
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:44,127
who came on this Earth to save us.

76
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:54,773
So, as it is, [inaudible]

77
00:09:54,974 --> 00:10:03,472
you have been already described about the
subtle system we have within ourselves.

78
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,334
That works out this ascent.

79
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:18,185
This triangular bone is called as the sacrum,
where this power of Kundalini resides.

80
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:24,783
That means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

81
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:31,072
Now, this resides in every individual.

82
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:35,632
She is your own individual mother.

83
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:40,519
She knows everything about you.

84
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,689
Like a tape recorder, she has taped all that you have aspired,

85
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,669
all that was your past.

86
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:58,936
So, it’s your own power,

87
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:03,151
which is to be awakened.

88
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:11,988
It is like a seed which is put in the
Mother Earth and sprouts by itself.

89
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:22,993
Now, the problem is that you have to understand that

90
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:28,622
what life we are having today is extremely chaotic.

91
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:31,665
Chaotic.

92
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,973
You don’t know about your children,

93
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:38,349
what drugs they will take. You don’t know about anyone,

94
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:43,246
what wrong life they have lived.

95
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:50,090
By forcing people to take to morality doesn’t work out at all.

96
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,536
So something more has to happen to us

97
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:58,588
that we develop our own personality.

98
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,403
That we have our own identity.

99
00:12:03,604 --> 00:12:07,768
That we know why are we on this Earth.

100
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,937
So, I was telling you about the second proof that

101
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:17,537
there’s an all pervading power of divine love.

102
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:26,711
In the Bible, it is said ‘Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost’, is called as.

103
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,461
In the Koran, it is called as ‘Ruh’.

104
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:38,488
And in the Indian scripture it is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

105
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:44,108
Whatever you may call it, it exists.

106
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:55,670
It thinks, it organizes, understands, it works out..works out,

107
00:12:55,871 --> 00:13:01,133
controls the nature,

108
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:04,998
ultimately it loves.

109
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:09,657
So you might find many coincides happening in your life,

110
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:14,038
which you cannot explain.

111
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:18,070
And you are surprised,

112
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:22,660
these coincides happen because of the guidance

113
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:28,829
of this all-pervading power of divine love.

114
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:34,607
So, when this power rises within us into six centres,

115
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,736
it pierces through our fontanelle bone area

116
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:43,193
and becomes one with the all-pervading power.

117
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:47,809
This union is the yoga,

118
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,443
where you become one with this power

119
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:59,067
and from your hands cool breeze like vibrations start flowing.

120
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:01,634
In…with these vibrations

121
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:07,575
you can know what’s wrong with your centres.

122
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:10,888
You know about yourself,

123
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,732
that means this is self-knowledge.

124
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:19,827
Then you can know about others also,

125
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:25,677
because you become collectively conscious.

126
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,819
Your awareness gets a new dimension

127
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,175
that you can feel the centres of others.

128
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:44,137
These centres, are there which cater to our
physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

129
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:47,701
When they get exhausted or weaken,

130
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:54,806
then you develop all kinds of physical, mental, emotional diseases.

131
00:14:55,007 --> 00:15:03,053
So when the Kundalini rises she nourishes
all these centres and corrects them,

132
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:11,635
and connects you to that all-pervading
power, the source of vital energy.

133
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:21,196
So, you get rid of your diseases and you become healthy person.

134
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:25,182
In India, we have got four doctors now,

135
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:30,725
who have got MD for curing people

136
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:37,660
with Sahaja Yoga of their diseases, which are incurable.

137
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:43,033
So, you know how to cure others,

138
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,148
you know how to cure yourself,

139
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:50,516
you become extremely dynamic with this force,

140
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:54,916
also extremely compassionate.

141
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:59,714
Many children who were very bad students have suddenly become

142
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:04,556
extremely intelligent and successful.

143
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:10,982
Thus all your problems, even financial problems are solved.

144
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:15,892
It is fantastic, the way I am saying things to you,

145
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:21,078
you might think that is something out of the blue,

146
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,701
but you don’t know you are fantastic,

147
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,499
you are glorious.

148
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,164
You are glorious.

149
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:37,626
But unless and until, you are connected to the mains,

150
00:16:37,827 --> 00:16:41,164
you don’t know yourself.

151
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:45,198
Supposing this thing is not connected to the mains,

152
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,744
it has no identity.

153
00:16:50,952 --> 00:16:57,423
Moreover, you give up all that is destructive.

154
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:01,740
We have in America, if you see people ideas

155
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:07,978
that you should enjoy every moment of your life.

156
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,093
And all their enjoyments are self-destructive.

157
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:16,633
They are saying that within ten years’ time,

158
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:23,137
65% of Americans will be mad or schizophrenic.

159
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:29,242
Or they will have other horrible diseases which are incurable.

160
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:36,088
Because their lifestyle is absolutely unwise, immature.

161
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:41,541
But if I say that, they won’t listen to me.

162
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:47,678
If I tell them, they won’t listen to me.

163
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:54,374
But if they get connected and the light
of the spirit comes in their attention,

164
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:59,332
then they are completely transformed.

165
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:05,536
I am talking of global transformation.

166
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:09,597
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

167
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:16,459
In Russia, in one program you cannot get less than 16,000 people.

168
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,014
On the whole, they are not so materialistic.

169
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:28,383
And at least, I would say 60% people are extremely spiritual.

170
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:34,937
I just don’t understand how they have such deep spirituality.

171
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:39,971
All other false gurus have been banned.

172
00:18:40,172 --> 00:18:43,245
That’s also very wise thing to do…

173
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:47,902
that’s also very wise thing to do.

174
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:52,130
Because there are so many seekers and they fall into traps

175
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:57,477
of these people who just want to make money.

176
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:03,499
You cannot pay for God or for spirituality.

177
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,699
What do we pay to this Mother Earth,
which gives us such beautiful flowers?

178
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,148
It is all built-in within you.

179
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:20,789
And it just works spontaneously, Sahaja,

180
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,802
you don’t have to pay for it.

181
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:31,969
It is something so invaluable.

182
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:38,196
As a result of this happening, you become enlightened.

183
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:42,420
Your attention becomes enlightened.

184
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:54,108
And if you pay attention to anything, you can solve the problem.

185
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:02,578
You must know that this all- pervading power is full of blessings.

186
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:09,561
It guides you, and it protects you.

187
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:16,570
It is to be in the Kingdom of God.

188
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:26,865
And the government of God is extremely alert and is very efficient.

189
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:31,980
You jump into the ocean of joy.

190
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:36,831
And you feel extremely secure.

191
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:43,201
Once Sahaja Yogis meet together

192
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:47,489
they have nothing but pure love.

193
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,194
There is no greed and there is no lust.

194
00:20:53,406 --> 00:20:58,360
Sahaja Yoga has created many beautiful families.

195
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:03,116
And also the children are very beautiful.

196
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:07,022
So, this is the judgement time.

197
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:13,584
You have to judge, yourself.

198
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:20,631
And you will know whether you want the truth or falsehood.

199
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:28,382
It’s working out everywhere and I am happy now in Brasil, in Rio,

200
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:32,900
there are so many people who are seeking.

201
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:40,846
So we'll have today here, tonight, the experience.

202
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:47,839
But, you must have a pure desire to get it.

203
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,418
That’s all is needed.

204
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:59,005
And it will work for all of you, I promise.

205
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:09,069
But if you are rude, adamant, and
don’t want it, it cannot be forced.

206
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,287
It will take hardly ten minutes.

207
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:21,652
But I request that nobody should walk out during that time.

208
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:27,635
I have already told you that I cannot force it on you.

209
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:31,844
Actually you have to ask for it.

210
00:22:32,045 --> 00:22:37,494
If you want, you will get it.

211
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:41,665
So for ten minutes you have to keep quiet

212
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:48,680
and if you do not want to have it, you should leave the hall.

213
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:55,632
I have already told you it is your own power,

214
00:22:55,856 --> 00:23:00,690
there is no obligation.

215
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:20,480
If you can all be seated, it would be better.

216
00:23:48,987 --> 00:23:55,517
There are very simple three conditions.

217
00:23:56,582 --> 00:24:06,999
The first one is that all of you have to be very confident about it,

218
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,676
that means you must forgive yourself,

219
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:17,117
you should not feel guilty at all.

220
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:20,909
At this moment, please remember that

221
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:28,341
this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness.

222
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:33,905
And you cannot do anything that cannot be

223
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:41,811
completely dissolved by the power of this ocean of love.

224
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:47,450
So, please forgive yourself.

225
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,810
Don't believe in people who say that you are sinners

226
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:54,543
or something like that. Just don't believe in them.

227
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,406
Because if you feel guilty,

228
00:24:56,607 --> 00:25:01,783
then the centre on the left hand side catches very much.

229
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:08,318
And physically you are hurt,

230
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:16,442
you get what you call Angina as one of the diseases.

231
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:21,997
Or you might get Spondylitis.

232
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:29,979
Or you might get what you call the lethargic organs.

233
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:35,984
So why have this guilt?

234
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:41,878
Actually you have to respect yourself.

235
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:50,896
The third condition is you have to forgive everyone.

236
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:57,051
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

237
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:06,750
But if you don’t forgive, then you fall into bad hands

238
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:11,876
because you torture yourself.

239
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:18,024
While the person who has troubled you is a happy person.

240
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:24,035
So don’t also think about them, because it’s a headache.

241
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:30,139
And you will feel very relaxed with that.

242
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:40,510
So again, these are the three simple
conditions that you have to follow.

243
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:46,034
It will help if you can take out the shoes.
