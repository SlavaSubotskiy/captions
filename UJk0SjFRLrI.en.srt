1
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,925
So today is a very happy and a

2
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:12,145
very very auspicious day for all of us.

3
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:19,265
That we have to offer a just a thread

4
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:25,025
to our brothers for their protection.

5
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:31,245
I've already told you the story of Alexander the Great.

6
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:35,185
How many of you have not heard it? Raise our hands.

7
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:39,325
Look at that! Ha ha ha ha. Can't be! All right.

8
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,265
So I'll tell you the story of Alexander.

9
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:46,905
Ha ha ha. You're very clever, I know. Ha ha ha.

10
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:48,445
All right.

11
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:53,405
So the story of Alexander is like this.

12
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:59,065
That Alexander the Great invaded India, you know,

13
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:03,285
much before Buddha was born. Or we can say...

14
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:07,225
No, we can say after Buddha was born.

15
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:13,825
And he went with the idea of conquering the whole of India.

16
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,945
He was very powerful man.

17
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:23,325
But God did not want that perhaps,

18
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:26,985
so he was once defeated

19
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:31,745
and one king called Puru arrested him.

20
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:35,765
Alexander had married an Indian lady.

21
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:40,185
And when he was under the arrest of this king,

22
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:44,165
that was the day of this Raksha Bandhan. Same day.

23
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:48,725
So, she was a clever lady,

24
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:53,585
she put one thread like this in a small little plate

25
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:58,005
and covered it nicely with some nice cloth

26
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:02,445
and sent it to the king Puru in his court.

27
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:06,625
When he took it to the court,

28
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:10,425
somebody, and gave it to him,

29
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:14,705
he had to wear it. Because that was the day of Raksha Bandhan.

30
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,345
And that day anybody who sends you this thread is...

31
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,585
you become the brother.

32
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:25,565
So then he asked, "Who is my sister?"

33
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:30,245
So they said, "She is the wife of Alexander."

34
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:34,225
And he got really upset with him, because a sister's husband

35
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,885
is something very great in India.

36
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:44,625
So he rushed to the jail and fell straight on his knees

37
00:10:44,825 --> 00:10:47,885
and begged off his pardon. He said, "I am sorry sir,

38
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:51,385
I didn't know you were the husband of my sister."

39
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,345
He said, "What?"
[King Puru:] "Ya, you are.

40
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:58,445
And I am sorry! I am very sorry for this thing,

41
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:04,705
that I have jailed you this way and I put you here behind the bars.

42
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:08,205
This was very wrong on my part."

43
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:11,325
And he was so apologetic,

44
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,325
that Alexander could not understand the whole thing.

45
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,625
Not only that! He brought him back

46
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,285
and put him on the throne, his own throne.

47
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:22,345
And he said, "Now you rule here, I cannot say anything.

48
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,965
Now you'll become the real king

49
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:28,685
and I have to become sort of your subject."

50
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,785
So Alexander started looking at him.

51
00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:34,725
He said, "I... I can't understand this."

52
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,505
So then he went to his house.

53
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:41,305
Then he went to his house with

54
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:48,905
so many things that the king had given him.

55
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:52,845
He gave jewelry, he gave saris, clothes for him

56
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:57,345
and all kinds of things plus horses and elephants.

57
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:01,805
And then, when he reached home, he found

58
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:05,505
that his wife was smiling behind the doors.

59
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:08,305
He said, "What's the matter?"
She said, "Don't you understand?"

60
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:12,685
He said, "No, I don't understand, these Indians are funny people.

61
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,665
I mean, I am such a dangerous man, he had put me in the jail

62
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,045
and now he has released me. I just can't understand these Indians.

63
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:26,365
How can this happen to a person who is so dangerous?"

64
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:29,785
So, then she smiled and she said,

65
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,285
"See, today is a day of Raksha Bandhan

66
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,765
and this is the thread I sent him.

67
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:38,305
And because this thread was tied to him, he became my brother

68
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,705
and he had to release you.

69
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:44,265
Because you are my brother." [Shri Mataji probably means "husband", ed.]

70
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:49,105
He was so frightened. He said, "That settles it. I am going home!

71
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:53,125
Because with this Indians who can leave a prisoner only on a thread,

72
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,345
you can't manage these people, are very difficult."

73
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,525
He could not understand.

74
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:04,305
Somebody can translate it in Italian,

75
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,965
because there are some Italian people here.

76
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,665
You can do it later on. The story can be told to them

77
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,345
in Italian language.

78
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,565
So this is what it is. Is so important,

79
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:22,525
that on this day if this is tied on your wrist,

80
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:26,645
then you become brothers and sisters.

81
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:32,265
Now, in Sahaja Yoga brotherhood is the most important.

82
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,845
That is the friendliness among ourselves.

83
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:39,745
When you are very good brothers and sisters,

84
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:44,365
first of all, your left vishuddhi improves. This left vishuddhi.

85
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,685
You get this left vishuddhi, because

86
00:13:46,885 --> 00:13:50,365
we don't have proper brother and sister relationship.

87
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,505
Is not that we should have our own sister,

88
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:58,705
but any woman who is a Sahaja Yogini is your sister.

89
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,925
Except for your own wife. And this is the feeling.

90
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,585
Unless and until we develop that pure feeling within ourselves,

91
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,725
we cannot work out Sahaja Yoga.

92
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:10,785
Sahaja Yoga cannot be worked out.

93
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:15,585
I know it's rather difficult to digest, but is a fact.

94
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:20,645
You have to feel clean and pure within your heart.

95
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,585
Now see, we are so many Sahaja Yogis together,

96
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:26,065
live in ashrams. We have no problems.

97
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,645
But supposing, if you had these problems,

98
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,525
this girl is running away with that boy,

99
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,185
that boy is running with that girl,

100
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,845
could not have known with whom she is living today.

101
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:38,565
And those problems can only be solved,

102
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:45,245
if you have the proper sense of a sister and a brother.

103
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:51,505
And that is our dharma. That is our valence.

104
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:55,585
That we should know that we have a brother,

105
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:59,885
who is our Rakhi brother, and all others are also our brothers.

106
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:05,785
A pure relationship must exist between brothers and sisters

107
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:11,505
and of course you have your own wife, which is your private thing.

108
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,525
There should be something like private in Sahaja Yoga

109
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,805
and that is the only thing that is private for you,

110
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,345
that you are husband and wife.

111
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,725
The rest of it is all collective.

112
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:26,725
And we have to live in a collective way among ourselves

113
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,485
in very pure relationships.

114
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:37,285
Now, as it is, we have to be in a collective way.

115
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:43,765
At a slightest provocation people become non-collective.

116
00:15:43,945 --> 00:15:46,505
They cannot have rapport with other Sahaja Yogis,

117
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:48,785
they cannot talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

118
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,685
they cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

119
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,685
then something wrong with them.

120
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:56,025
They must understand something wrong with them

121
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,985
and nothing wrong with others.

122
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,105
I know of a Sahaja Yogi who came and told me, "Mother,

123
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,725
they are very unkind to me, they are very suspicious of me,

124
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:08,585
they do this and do that." Nothing of the kind! It was his own mind

125
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,645
that was working like that and giving him ideas

126
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,905
against other Sahaja Yogis.

127
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:17,045
So never criticize your brothers and sisters.

128
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,545
There is no need to criticize.

129
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,325
If you have to criticize, criticize yourself.

130
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:25,585
Best way is to criticize yourself and see for yourself,

131
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,885
what's wrong with you that you cannot fit into the collective.

132
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:32,785
As you know, it's a tremendous task

133
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,665
and so important today, so vital,

134
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:39,665
that we all should establish Sahaja Yoga properly.

135
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:44,105
Without Sahaja Yoga, do you see any, any other remedy,

136
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:49,785
any other solution for today's chaos? We do not see any.

137
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:54,745
Now, what do we have to do? I don't say you must

138
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:58,285
bring Himalayas here, nor do I say

139
00:16:58,465 --> 00:17:01,605
that you must swim for seven miles together,

140
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:06,645
nor do I say that you must take a plane

141
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,705
which will take you round the world in one night.

142
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,705
Nothing of the kind. These feats are not needed.

143
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,605
A simple feat of rapport,

144
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,965
of love being communicated to others.

145
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,965
Just a simple thing it is, it's the simplest.

146
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:28,145
You see the children; how they are so simple,

147
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:32,965
how they are so natural, that they immediately feel the love

148
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:36,545
and immediately react. But we cannot.

149
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,405
The why... what is the reason? Why can't we react in that way?

150
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,565
Why our attention is not on that point

151
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:46,585
where we should react in such a manner

152
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:51,585
that we should be absolutely congenial,

153
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,205
enjoying each other's company.

154
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,905
The reason is, our attention is outside.

155
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,885
And the attention is outside in the West, as you have seen it,

156
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:06,085
on something wrong, because there is no brother-and-sisterly feeling.

157
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,605
Supposing, a brother and sister are walking,

158
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,865
they won't look at each other, will they?

159
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:18,125
Will they be watching each other? No.

160
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:24,465
But the attention that goes outside all the time towards

161
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:29,605
all kinds of funny things, because there is no pure relationship.

162
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:33,825
Purity helps you to understand the beauty of others.

163
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:37,445
Otherwise there's a thought in between, always a thought.

164
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:40,565
If it's a dirty thought, of course the purity is not there at all.

165
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,745
But even other thoughts like possessiveness, of criticism,

166
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:51,545
say, of repulsion, anything like that can kill the joy.

167
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:55,665
So try to understand that there is something wrong with you,

168
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:59,625
that's why you cannot get truly collective.

169
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:05,845
We are one homogeneous big huge family.

170
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,805
And for any mother,

171
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:12,485
what is the greatest pleasure, which I have told you many times, is that

172
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,505
to see her children enjoying each other,

173
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:20,825
loving each other. And when I see all of you

174
00:19:21,025 --> 00:19:25,145
loving each other and pulling each other's legs

175
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:29,285
and pinching everyone and enjoying each other's company,

176
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:32,525
I really enjoy. And when you shout at each other

177
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:38,185
and also sometimes box each other, I like it. (Laughter.)

178
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:40,825
Because there is an expression of love in it.

179
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,645
And that is what we have to learn, how to express ourselves.

180
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:48,645
First, express yourself to your fellow being that are

181
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:51,845
your kith and kin, are Sahaja Yogis.

182
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,625
They are your brothers and they are your sisters.

183
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:59,185
Like once Christ was told, "Your brother and sisters have come."

184
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,885
He said, "Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?"

185
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:06,245
These are His brothers and these are His sisters!

186
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,265
He is the eldest brother you have

187
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,465
and you are all His brothers and sisters.

188
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,485
That is how one should understand

189
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:17,385
that this is a relationship of brother and sister.

190
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,265
And that's such a pure relationship.

191
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:23,905
Now, when this relationship goes off,

192
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,405
you get into troubles. Very much into troubles.

193
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:32,445
Whenever I went to Cambridge, I found the Vishnumaya

194
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,485
would just go on bombarding there.

195
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:37,965
Every time there used to be lightening, lightening, lightening.

196
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,805
This time it was at least hundred and eight times,

197
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,045
there was bombardment when I was there.

198
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:45,445
Whole night I couldn't sleep, I was wondering.

199
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,945
But now I realized what was the reason is

200
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,965
that in Cambridge University,

201
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,965
it's a university just like Oxford, any other university,

202
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,525
but Cambridge University is one of the most important universities.

203
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:58,905
In that university there are young people,

204
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,305
young boys, young girls studying.

205
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:04,345
In an university the relationship between

206
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:07,565
brother and sister should be absolutely pure.

207
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:13,405
So pure that generations together we cannot marry.

208
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,445
As we have in our country, the gotras.

209
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:18,845
What are the gotras? Are the universities.

210
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:23,465
And people cannot marry in the same gotra for generations together.

211
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,885
Even now supposing my gotra is Shandilya,

212
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:28,845
which was, must be, thirteen fourteen thousands years back.

213
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:33,405
And even today I cannot marry a person who is from the same gotra.

214
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:37,105
So imagine, such purity was maintained and that is what it is.

215
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:40,585
In a university, there is no purity maintained.

216
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,985
That's the reason in Cambridge, I found, that

217
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:46,025
whenever I go there, Vishnumaya goes on just...

218
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:48,845
I don't know, She could just goes mad.

219
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:52,265
And every time we have had this experience.

220
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,105
And now I know the reason,

221
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:57,705
so I am sure next time She won't do that.

222
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,525
Is very important, specially in young age, to understand

223
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:07,125
that we have to keep our attention very still.

224
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,625
If you do not gather wisdom in young age,

225
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,925
you can never have wisdom in old age.

226
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,585
In young age you must try to gather wisdom. Is very important.

227
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,865
And this wisdom comes from Shri Ganesha, as you know.

228
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:23,245
And what is Shri Ganesha? Is innocence,

229
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:28,185
is purity and also is knowledge.

230
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:31,885
From that it comes to you and that purity

231
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:35,625
has to be kept the way Shri Ganesha had kept

232
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:39,785
in His own incarnation as Christ.

233
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:43,565
So we have to understand that our attention has to be

234
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:48,105
so pure, so pure that it should not waste

235
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,445
anyone of our energies.

236
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,005
You know that with purity in your eyes,

237
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:57,185
even a glance, even a glance

238
00:22:57,385 --> 00:23:01,805
can create such a beautiful life for others. Even a glance.

239
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:06,785
So, one has to try, is to get very pure eyes.

240
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,605
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

241
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:12,365
This is what we have to follow, all of us,

242
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,825
and our attention has to be all right.

243
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,345
For that this Raksha Bandhan is a very good thing.

244
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,365
Is a very good thing in which you create

245
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:24,445
such personality of your own that

246
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:29,665
you do not anymore try to put your attention on the wrong thing.

247
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:32,885
Now, this attention goes out with many other things also,

248
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:36,885
like aggressiveness, can be possessiveness.

249
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:42,365
But the main thing is this, that if you do not have

250
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:46,385
lust in your eyes, fifty percent you are all right.

251
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:49,185
And half or fifty percent is greed,

252
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:51,525
for which you have to work on the Nabhi chakra

253
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:54,485
and which we'll work it out on Diwali day.

254
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:57,285
So for today, I think we have to remember

255
00:23:57,485 --> 00:24:01,785
that to get rid of all the lust from our eyes,

256
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:07,765
we are celebrating today this beautiful auspicious day

257
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:13,105
to celebrate the love between brothers and sisters.

258
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:16,665
Now, I don't know whom you have chosen to be your new sister today.

259
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:22,045
But it should not be just a thing of a lip service.

260
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:24,965
Sister is a sister and all your life

261
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:27,205
you have to remember she is your sister.

262
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:33,265
You have to look after her benevolence and her good life

263
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:38,585
and she has to bless you or she has to pray to God

264
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:41,705
that you should be always protected.

265
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:44,885
May God bless you all.

266
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:51,445
So now, if you have anybody between yourselves...

267
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:54,685
Now, have you got the Rakhis?

268
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:58,865
Aah, we must... today I must say

269
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,205
that poor Warren had to go back to Shudy Camps,

270
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:04,045
because nobody is there and Shudy Camp is alone,

271
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:07,045
so somebody has to go and tie Rakhi to him.

272
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,405
But he tied a Rakhi to me, a first of all, you see,

273
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,385
is very clever fellow.

274
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:14,605
And taken away my watch.

275
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:25,165
Alright.

276
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:29,725
In such a big group it's not easy to do all the

277
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:35,225
rituals we did last time, alright? But -, now.

278
00:25:40,365 --> 00:25:44,085
[INAUDIBLE]

279
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:54,385
Now, first of all,

280
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:58,885
the girls who want to tie Rakhi

281
00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:01,305
should take it from here, one each,

282
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:04,605
and go and tie to anyone you feel like.

283
00:26:04,785 --> 00:26:06,825
But tie to one person.

284
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:11,105
And one person should tie to one person.

285
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:15,805
Not that only everybody tying to one person, is not good.

286
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:21,165
All right. So here it is. Now, who it is, who will give it to you?

287
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:29,925
So these are here, you can take anyone you like. Now.

288
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:39,425
[Shri Mataji speaking in Indian language.]

289
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:46,625
So what you can do is to tie one to your...

290
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,905
one each, everybody should have. And should tie... exchange it.

291
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,385
Is it alright?

292
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:56,745
This is to be tied to the brother only, but

293
00:26:56,945 --> 00:27:01,745
in North India they also tie to their sister.

294
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:06,325
So that's here now. [?] So the sister's is on the left hand

295
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:08,485
and the brother's is on the right hand.

296
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:12,645
Now, how do you do it. Pass it on, to everyone.

297
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:19,325
Now, don't run for one person.

298
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:29,285
You can tie it... [INAUDIBLE].

299
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,865
From Australia.

300
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:51,645
Somebody else should come here to distribute.

301
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:56,985
Antonio, just take it. Take it, from here.

302
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,785
They are only two, we can give it to the leaders

303
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:04,505
or something, here, separately.

304
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:14,105
I'm sorry for delay, but I was cooking for all of you well...

305
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,285
You should read this after.

306
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:36,885
It's alright. So I'll take this?

307
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:43,425
Now, should we... we can sing some songs also, while distributing.

308
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:55,205
Perhaps some music?

309
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:03,185
Today I am sorry, we'll not have any pujas because I am really...

310
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,665
I'll have three pujas now, one after another.

311
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:08,005
It will be too much. We had Bhoomi Puja

312
00:29:08,185 --> 00:29:10,865
and now we are going to have, I mean, alright?

313
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:14,225
Krishna Puja, then Ganesha Puja, then Devi Puja,

314
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:17,905
so it's going to be too much. So I would request you that this is...

315
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:22,145
Today it's just like a puja after all, isn't it?

316
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:26,925
Very good. This one.
