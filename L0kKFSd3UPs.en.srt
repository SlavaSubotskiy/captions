1
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:03,200
… by the Divine.

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:10,252
For example, if I know only my head,
that is not sufficient.

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,932
If I know only my neck,
that is not sufficient.

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:18,892
If I know only my legs,
that is not sufficient.

5
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:22,372
But the more I know about myself,

6
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:26,452
the more dynamic I become,

7
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:31,852
the more expansive I become.

8
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:41,292
And all the great that existed —

9
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:45,032
or all the people
who were called as great —

10
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:50,552
are great because they lived
in many human beings.

11
00:00:55,819 --> 00:01:00,539
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere,

12
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,419
as you are feeling because you know
they are not foreigners,

13
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,219
they are your brothers and sisters.

14
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:17,779
There are so many stories
in Puranas like this, that…

15
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:26,572
I will not name it, but once
two brothers met in a jungle.

16
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,221
But they thought that they were enemies,

17
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,493
and they wanted to fight with each other.

18
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:40,413
And when they came to blows,
they couldn’t hit each other.

19
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:47,022
Then they took out their arrows —
the arrows wouldn’t work.

20
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:51,382
They were quite surprised at this,

21
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:55,742
and when they asked each other,
“Who is your mother?”,

22
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:59,662
they found out mother was the same.

23
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:06,102
And then they realized that they were
not foreigners neither enemies

24
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:11,022
but they were made of the same fibre.

25
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:20,570
What sweetness, what beauty
that knowledge has given them!

26
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:28,130
And what security of understanding

27
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:31,904
that everywhere in the whole world
we have brothers and sisters,

28
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:37,536
who are on their inner being,
on their divine,

29
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:42,856
and how we are bound together
with that love!

30
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,607
When I talk of love,

31
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:51,687
people think that I am trying
to make you weak people —

32
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:57,247
because people think
those who love are weak.

33
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:05,367
But the most dynamic power
in this world is that of love.

34
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:13,012
Is the most aggressive power —
is that of love.

35
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:17,892
Even we, when we suffer in love,

36
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:24,092
it is out of our strength that we suffer
and not out of our weakness.

37
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,767
For example,
there was a teacher in China

38
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:38,807
who used to teach the cocks
how to fight.

39
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,087
And the king of that place
took his cocks to that teacher

40
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:52,673
and told him that
“You please teach them how to fight.”

41
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,900
After one month, when the king
went to take those cocks with him,

42
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,660
he was surprised that the cocks
were just silent, doing nothing.

43
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,450
And he told the teacher that
“What have you done to my cocks?

44
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,250
They are not at all aggressive,
they are not doing anything!

45
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,490
How are they going to fight it out?

46
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,490
There’s going to be a race,

47
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,264
there’s going to be an exhibition
of their strength,

48
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,271
and what are we going to do about it?”

49
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,191
He said, “You just take them.”

50
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:30,191
He took those two cocks with him
and put them in the arena

51
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:34,991
where there were other cocks
who had come to fight.

52
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:38,374
These two cocks
were very nicely standing.

53
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:44,134
All the other cocks
started coaxing and torturing.

54
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:48,054
They were just standing
and looking at them.

55
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:54,001
All the other cocks were surprised
at their behaviour

56
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:56,801
and thought that they were very powerful.

57
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,001
And they all fled away.

58
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:08,252
The love that I’m talking about,
the divine love,

59
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:15,612
makes you not only strong but dynamic.

60
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:22,852
It is the greatest luminous power
that we can think of.

61
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:31,952
Only when love is surrounded by gross
and is lost in the gross,

62
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:38,992
it looks as if it is weak
and “under chains”.

63
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:45,192
The time it is released,
the dynamic power of love

64
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:53,887
can transcend
all the evil powers of the world.

65
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,247
When people get their Realization,

66
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:08,278
automatically the ego drops out —
to a great extent, I should say.

67
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:12,758
Because you say
that the vibrations are passing;

68
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,398
you don’t say that you are giving them.

69
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,420
Because the dropping of the ego

70
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,660
sometimes it happens that you feel

71
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:35,197
that whatever you wanted to have
you have got it

72
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:38,677
and you better not talk about it.

73
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:41,597
When there is any opposition
from anywhere,

74
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:46,837
you shun it and sit away from it.

75
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:52,637
You don’t want to face the opposition —
of any negative opposition,

76
00:06:52,837 --> 00:06:58,717
whether it is by speech
or by… even by evil methods.

77
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:04,317
We run away from that, thinking,
“Oh God! How are we going to face it?”

78
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:11,316
On the contrary, a person
who is negative, who has got hatred,

79
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:17,516
becomes… [Marathi word?] they call it,
means a person who talks big.

80
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:22,716
Such a person talks… starts talking big.

81
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:28,556
He thinks he is above everybody else,
he can befool all the world.

82
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,309
He takes a responsibility on himself.

83
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,509
He starts a big ashram or some big place
where he sits down with all his ignorance

84
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,889
and starts spreading his knowledge —
the so-called — to people.

85
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:52,209
By his methods people get impressed,
and they all go and fall at his feet.

86
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,609
While the realized sits at home quietly,

87
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,529
wondering what are these fools doing.

88
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:09,114
But it is not now
for the realized to sit down

89
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:13,194
and to wonder and laugh
at the foolishness of the people

90
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:15,914
who are not yet realized.

91
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:21,274
Not even to take pity on them
but to come out,

92
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:26,272
come out with the sword of love
to win the whole world.

93
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,032
It is very, very essential.

94
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:33,272
If the creation has to be saved,

95
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,752
then you are not to keep mum about it.

96
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,180
All the wrong ideas about love,

97
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,220
all the falsehood about love
has to be given up.

98
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:57,300
One must know
that it is the dynamic power.

99
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:02,644
And it won’t allow you
to sit comfortably with yourself,

100
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,348
enjoying the peace and the bliss,

101
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:09,948
when the rest of the world
is not enjoying that

102
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:16,108
and is playing into the hands
of the evil geniuses

103
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:20,468
who have come in this world to destroy

104
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:28,148
and to bring the satanic realm

105
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,353
on this earth.

106
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:35,433
Now the days are gone
when the people had to suffer.

107
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,313
Christ suffered for us.

108
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:41,913
Of course, Christ never suffered,
because He never suffered.

109
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:45,113
He never wept.

110
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:53,245
He was like those cocks,
a very powerful personality.

111
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:56,605
But today is the day

112
00:09:57,085 --> 00:10:00,165
to brighten up your understanding

113
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:05,725
about your own strength
that is within you.

114
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:16,158
Those who are gross
should worry about their insecurities,

115
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:20,798
and their problems,
and their organizations —

116
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:25,078
but not for the people who are realized.

117
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,358
I have told you many a times —
and today he also remarked —

118
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:33,118
that you should know you are never alone
when you are realized.

119
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:35,622
There have been many people
who have been realized,

120
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,222
before even you were born,

121
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:41,382
who exist,

122
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:46,782
who are anxious to help you
at every moment.

123
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,372
In our shastras [scriptures] we call them
chiranjivas [eternal beings], you know them.

124
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:01,612
They are people who are niranjanas
[pure, free from falsehood].

125
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:10,806
As he said about Bhairava and Hanumana,
all these people exist,

126
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:15,894
and they are waiting
just for a call from you.

127
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,159
Once we went to the market,

128
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
and there was a problem

129
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,427
about something.

130
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:43,027
And I had somebody with Me, a disciple…
who was also with Me.

131
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:46,347
I just wanted to see
what will be his reaction.

132
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:51,627
He tried to argue out with a person
to tell him about something.

133
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:54,747
So he told Me, “Mataji, let us go now.”

134
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,027
When we came out the shop, I said,
“What are you going to do about it?”

135
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:02,187
He said, “I have already told Hanuman
to look after that part.”

136
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:04,627
And the work was done.

137
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:08,187
It is gross, but it happens.

138
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,131
When they fail
[Shri Mataji could mean “you fail”],

139
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,971
you can leave it to anyone of them,
and they will have to jolly well do it.

140
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,891
Because it is you who are on the stage
and not they.

141
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:24,251
They are the background people.

142
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,125
They are the playbacks.

143
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,285
But you must open your mouth;
otherwise, if they start thinking,

144
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,485
what will people say?

145
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:38,245
They are going to help you in every way,

146
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,678
but how far are you standing
on your security?

147
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:47,896
How far you are standing on your property,
on your understanding of yourself?

148
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,910
It’s a great war going on.

149
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,830
You are not aware of it?

150
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,750
Some of you are.

151
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,790
Some of you are definitely aware of it

152
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,110
because they have had the experience
of fighting it out.

153
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,757
It’s a big war on.

154
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:20,957
Now specially, when ten rakshasas [demons]
have taken their avataras [incarnations].

155
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:30,037
And for you to be so feeble…

156
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:36,369
You are still small children, no doubt,

157
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:39,889
because you got your Realization
only a few days back.

158
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,329
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

159
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,089
You can grow into big, big giants.

160
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:47,849
All of you can grow.

161
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:53,809
Only thing, you have to decide
that you have to grow within.

162
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,041
There are so many things

163
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:03,841
that you only have discovered,
by which a person grows.

164
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,601
I can give you food,

165
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,361
but you have to grow yourself.

166
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:22,184
Wherever you see the negativity,
you have to stand up and say,

167
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:26,144
“This is negativity and nothing else,
whether you like it or not.”

168
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:30,264
In that, you love that person,
you don’t hate.

169
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:34,785
Only talking sweetly
is not the idea of love.

170
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:38,825
No, a mother sometimes
even scolds the child.

171
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,345
Doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love him.

172
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:45,425
If it is necessary, you have to tell
the person that it is negativity.

173
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,425
Of course, if there’s a realized person,
he won’t mind any correction,

174
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,305
because he wants the correction,
he knows that it has to be corrected.

175
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:55,265
The instrument has to be corrected.

176
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:58,785
But a person who doesn’t understand,

177
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,833
you have to force your love
on that person.

178
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:06,233
You can force that love,
you know that — sitting down here.

179
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:11,273
Many people have tried putting love
around certain people

180
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,513
who were trying to be mischievous —

181
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,633
and they have been able to achieve
great results.

182
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,153
Those people have turned back
and come back.

183
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,993
Only by putting your hand
and putting your attention on that person

184
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,833
and moving this hand like this,

185
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:32,473
the love encircles,
and the person comes back.

186
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:39,804
There is no doubt
that there is negativity and positivity,

187
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:42,844
nothing in between these,
you must remember.

188
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,204
There is no compromise between the two.

189
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:49,204
Either it is light and darkness,

190
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:54,074
or it is positive and negative —

191
00:15:54,274 --> 00:16:00,274
definitely there are two things
that are fighting.

192
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:10,022
Only thing, your will —
that’s the trouble with the whole joke.

193
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:15,502
That your will is respected,
your will is throughout respected.

194
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:21,862
If you have the will
to be a giant that loves, you can be.

195
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,942
The other day I met a psychiatrist,

196
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:27,876
and he was catching
his superego very much.

197
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:29,596
I said, “What’s wrong with you?”

198
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:34,156
He said, “My childhood.
My childhood, I couldn’t get much love.”

199
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:37,996
I said, “Now I am there.
You come in My lap. Take the love.”

200
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:40,796
He said, “I want to flow my love, Mother.

201
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:46,116
I want to open out myself,
completely, without any fear.”

202
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:49,276
I said, “You just start it.

203
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:53,716
Don’t worry what people
are going to misunderstand,

204
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,289
what people are going to say.

205
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,889
It’s nothing important
what people are going to say or anything.

206
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,729
For love, the satisfaction is only love,
that you love another person.”

207
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,929
“You just flow your love,” I said,
“and you will feel it will work out.

208
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:12,249
Just decide that ‘I am going
to love people.’

209
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:17,377
And once you decide that,
the whole heaven,

210
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:21,777
the whole power of the heaven
will fall at your feet.

211
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:24,457
You believe Me in this.”

212
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:29,297
If you see otherwise,
I am an ordinary housewife.

213
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,023
Some people always say,
“Mataji, how can be like this?”

214
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,663
Why not? I am just like you.

215
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,925
I have the same problems as you have.

216
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,925
But only thing I know,

217
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,101
that I am nothing but embodiment
of that love that is divine,

218
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:48,381
and I can’t exist without it.

219
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:54,581
Every moment of My life
let the love flow, let the love flow.

220
00:17:54,821 --> 00:18:02,261
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

221
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:11,097
And that makes you completely powerful.

222
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,137
If you read…
I was reading Devi Mahatmyam that…

223
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:18,537
they talk about a rakshasa

224
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:24,737
who faced Primordial Mother,
the Divine Mother,

225
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:29,632
and he laughed at Her: “You woman!
What can you do to me, you are a woman!

226
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,272
What can you do to me?”

227
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:37,472
And She smiled at him and said,
“All right, come along, let us see.”

228
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:42,424
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

229
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:46,064
Very clearly that shows

230
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:49,427
that positivity can cut
the throat of negativity.

231
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,331
There is no himsa [violence] in that.

232
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,811
You must remember the difference
between the two.

233
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,251
If negativity is cut
and positive brought out,

234
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:01,861
that is the greatest ahimsa [non-violence]
you can do to someone.

235
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:05,812
You have seen what negativity does to people;
you have now known what is negativity.

236
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:10,492
You have seen how people suffer
with spirits on them.

237
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:16,085
And here, they are also anxious
to be loved your way,

238
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:20,525
you’ll be surprised to know that —
if you really love them.

239
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:24,725
They themselves come to Me
and say, “Give me salvation, Mother.”

240
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:27,525
They come to Me only for that —
sometimes with you —

241
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:29,645
that I should give them salvation.

242
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:32,365
And if I promise that,
they take the birth again.

243
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:35,632
But there are rakshasas,
there are rakshasas.

244
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:41,191
As I told you the other day,
the Kali Yuga has laid a beautiful stage,

245
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:45,511
and a very wonderful drama
is to be played —

246
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:53,911
in which the Ravana
has to love Sita as a mother,

247
00:19:54,754 --> 00:20:00,034
the Kansa has to fall
at the feet of Radha.

248
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:08,275
Perhaps, you do not know
that Krishna wanted to kill Kansa.

249
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,235
At that time, he was His uncle.

250
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:14,755
So, you see, the feeling came in Him,
of His mother,

251
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,995
that “After all, he is my brother.”
[Shri Mataji could mean “her brother”]

252
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:20,198
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him —

253
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:24,078
the Radha, who loved
the whole world at that time.

254
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:27,998
She is the embodiment of love,
and She killed Kansa —

255
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:32,318
because it was to be.

256
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,879
When you are playing
in the hands of God,

257
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:42,079
then, if He wants to kill some body,
it has to be slain.

258
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,319
But first of all you have to be
in the hands of God completely.

259
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:56,519
It is His love only
which kills this body.

260
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:16,246
And when the songs
of their strength and victory is sung —

261
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:21,366
you have seen it, all My chakras,
how they start working and vibrating.

262
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:27,006
Because the strength
of those victorious days

263
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:32,358
is still lingering on,
and it is going to work through you.

264
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,591
But what about your poor instrument,

265
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:42,485
which is moving little slowly?

266
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:56,325
The time when love has to rule,
the Satya Yuga,

267
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:04,885
if it has to come, it is going to be
through your efforts, now.

268
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:11,372
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts.
But now, all your efforts are divine.

269
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:15,332
Whatever you do,
whatever sympathetic you activate,

270
00:22:15,532 --> 00:22:20,852
you are getting it through parasympathetic —
you don’t do anything at all.

271
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:29,896
But you can see yourself
what stakes are involved.

272
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:37,654
You are the chosen ones,
otherwise why is it

273
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:40,734
that you are the only people
who got this Realization

274
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,374
and so much you have come forward?

275
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:47,934
Some of you got it only few days back
and have gone very far. Why?

276
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:53,614
You are the chosen ones,
and you have to take it upon yourself

277
00:22:56,174 --> 00:23:01,569
to be the channels of that divine love,
that dynamic power,

278
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:07,293
which is going to transform
the whole conception of hatred

279
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:13,093
on which all these nations
and all these differences are created.

280
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:19,133
It looks sometimes: how? how can it be?

281
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:29,442
But now the days are gone, of Gokul
[city of Shri Krishna’s childhood].

282
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,322
I was thinking of it.

283
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,042
Of the time when Krishna
used to play His flute

284
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:39,642
and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the gopis
and the gopas [cowherd girls and boys].

285
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,859
Oh, we tried and tried and tried,
in different lives!

286
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,899
Nothing worked.

287
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:54,099
And now it is going to click
like a spark.

288
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,249
The chain reaction will start.

289
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:03,849
But we have to have
strong machines to carry that.

290
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,609
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

291
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:12,472
Only the strength that is in you
is to be felt by your attention.

292
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:16,072
That’s the only thing you have to do —
is to feel your attention

293
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:19,232
and give up all that is falsehood.

294
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,592
All that is falsehood
you see within yourself,

295
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,952
and you will know what is falsehood
and just drop it.

296
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:28,539
Accept only the truth,
and the truth will give you that power

297
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:32,041
to be the real instrument,

298
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:35,281
to carry this channel,

299
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:39,561
that force of love.

300
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:54,438
It should not mean
that you have to be egoistic —

301
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:58,158
you cannot be even if you try to.

302
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:02,038
You cannot harm anyone
even if you want to trouble.

303
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,410
So many of you have expressed

304
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:05,891
that “Mataji, You are giving it
to every Dick, Tom and Harry.”

305
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:07,571
I can’t give it to Dick, Tom and Harry —

306
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:10,171
it has to be a man
who has been searching,

307
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:13,251
it has to be a woman who has been searching
in their previous lives.

308
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:18,851
You should know that whatever you have got it,
you have got it in your own right.

309
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:22,071
So, a person may look
like a Dick, Tom, Harry,

310
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,871
but he is not, he’s a great saint.

311
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:27,911
They are all saints sitting here.

312
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:31,471
It’s a centre and nucleus of saintliness

313
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:35,351
where the complete Divine is flowing.

314
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:40,591
Only thing is, let it flow out from you.

315
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,086
This power is that of God,

316
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:49,766
and it is not your responsibility

317
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:53,286
to worry as to whether it will do
good or bad.

318
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:56,886
Even if you think
that it may do some bad things

319
00:25:57,086 --> 00:26:00,633
according to the moral sciences
of this world,

320
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:04,681
ultimately it is going to be all right.

321
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:08,961
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed?
Why that Kansa was to be killed?

322
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:12,401
Why Ravana was to be killed?

323
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:17,083
Of course, killing doesn’t help much —
that I have realized.

324
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:22,203
Because all those who were killed
are back again in their saddles.

325
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:29,443
But still, you don’t fight

326
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,739
those horrible people.

327
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:37,739
You just fight yourself out.

328
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:43,179
You just watch yourself.

329
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:46,939
Where are you? What are you doing?

330
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:52,219
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

331
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:56,339
Just think about it every moment,

332
00:26:56,539 --> 00:26:59,219
every moment you are in meditation.

333
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:03,058
Just think of the moment
and the dynamism of that moment.

334
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:08,328
The complete power that is filling
every moment just to go inside you.

335
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,343
It will flow through your Sahastrara
inside your being,

336
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:16,983
and completely revolve
around your whole being,

337
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:21,663
and transform the inside
into a complete Chaitanya Shakti,

338
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,023
a complete Divine Power.

339
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:28,998
Allow it to come in, accept it.

340
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:31,358
Accept it without any fear.

341
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,558
Let it get in.

342
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:42,238
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

343
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:47,198
It’s a very precarious time
that we are up to.

344
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:51,598
I have only two hands,
you can see that very clearly.

345
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:55,398
And though Mr. ___ says
that I can do everything,

346
00:27:55,598 --> 00:28:00,861
I can do everything
but not to make you do something.

347
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,170
Your will will be respected throughout.

348
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,434
Every other thing can be looked after

349
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:19,634
except for one —
that you should be a perfect machine,

350
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:26,234
a perfect channel, a perfect flute

351
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,100
for My Lord to play that tune of love.

352
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:38,300
It is for you to clear out
all your seven holes.

353
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,028
It is for you to clear out
your hollowness

354
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:51,978
and to be complete within yourself —
and He knows His job.

355
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:56,959
He is the artist.

356
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,879
But you are the instruments.

357
00:29:01,515 --> 00:29:07,515
And the harmonious music
from so many souls

358
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:12,795
can fill the ears of these evil people

359
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,965
and can penetrate into their heart
and put love into them,

360
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:24,168
and may be that they themselves
will give up their evil ways

361
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:28,328
and fall at the feet of love.

362
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,568
Krishna is to be born within you today.

363
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:49,972
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kaliya
[monstrous serpent who lived in river Yamuna].

364
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:56,412
That Krishna is to be born within you.

365
00:29:56,932 --> 00:30:00,212
Went and sat on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara

366
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,891
and was pressing with His feet,

367
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:08,955
and all the people were seeing
this great drama

368
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:14,915
of Krishna’s dancing
on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara.

369
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:21,995
Krishna is to be born within your being.

370
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:31,725
When you are Krishna,
you are not going to see Him.

371
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:52,652
Let us now go to the state

372
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,732
which is beyond words,

373
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:58,492
beyond thoughts,

374
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:05,452
into the realm of thoughtless awareness,

375
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:12,093
where the Divine
is pouring its blessings.

376
00:31:18,573 --> 00:31:24,573
These people have decided today
to have a puja,

377
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:29,848
and you know what happens to Me
when you do My puja.

378
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:35,728
So, with all those problems
that we’ll be facing later,

379
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:40,184
I would like all of you
to be attentive about the puja

380
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:46,719
and to take full advantage of that.

381
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,110
With this puja you get
the Mother’s protection,to begin with.

382
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,390
And My chakras, when they start moving,

383
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,150
they give you special powers of love,

384
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:05,270
and bless all your chakras,
and fill them up completely.

385
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,470
So I would like you —

386
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,219
though some two people
are coming to do this —

387
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,379
all of you to feel
that you all are doing it —

388
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:18,139
and you can feel it that way
with oneness.

389
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:24,539
And the blessings of My being
will flow to you automatically.
