Sahasrara Puja Cabella Ligure, Italy
6th May 6, 2001

2
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:06,309
Today I bow to all the Sahaja yogis

3
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:08,892
who have found the truth.

4
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:19,434
There has been from ages

5
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:23,017
the seeking for the truth.

6
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,017
And when people discovered

7
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,476
that there’s no other way but to surrender

8
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:40,476
to the Divine that you can find the truth,

9
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,184
they did not know how to do it,  how to work it out.

10
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:53,017
There have been seekers all over the world.

11
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,142
I went to Turkey and I was amazed  there have been lots of Sufis,

12
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:02,892
but their disciples were not realized souls,

13
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:07,476
because the Sufis also did not know how they got their realization.

14
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:13,142
Such darkness existed around

15
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,892
people who were seeking.

16
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,808
All over the world I find,

17
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:23,225
when I was a little girl,

18
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:29,476
that they are completely ignorant about

19
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:32,933
how to find the truth.

20
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:39,850
So many were lost in all kinds of so-called

21
00:09:40,184 --> 00:09:43,476
religions and rituals.

22
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,058
All kinds of rituals they used to do;

23
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,767
morning till evening, some sort of a ritual they would do.

24
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,434
Whether they were Hindus, Christians, Muslims,

25
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
they all believed that by doing all  these rituals

26
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,767
you’ll achieve something, that you will know the truth,

27
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,892
that you will get your Self-realization.

28
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:14,850
All such seekers went to wrong people

29
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:19,142
and to wrong directions,

30
00:10:19,808 --> 00:10:23,225
because they were really seeking from their heart.

31
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,017
So they were very misleading,

32
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:32,225
misleading and they were misled

33
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,392
into such horrible black areas

34
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:43,850
that they did not know what they were seeking,

35
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:47,184
what they are supposed to seek, what they have to have.

36
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,392
It has been prophesized

37
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:59,058
that when Kali Yuga will come,

38
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:02,476
people will find themselves.

39
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:08,850
There’s a story about Nala and Kali,

40
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:18,350
who had taken away the wife,

41
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,058
Damayanti, of Nala.

42
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:29,309
So once Nala caught hold of him,

43
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:33,350
and he said that “Now I’m going to kill you,

44
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,808
because you are a very mischievous man

45
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:39,267
and you have done such a harm to me.”

46
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:45,017
So the Kali said,

47
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,058
“You can kill me,

48
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:50,017
but before that you should know what is my importance,

49
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:55,184
what is my mahatva. And the my importance is

50
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,808
that when my time will come”

51
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,975
–when Kali Yuga will come –

52
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:07,392
“then all those people who are seeking the truth

53
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:15,434
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,

54
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:22,933
in the Himalayas will become ordinary householders,

55
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:28,892
they’ll be householders. They won’t be sanyasis going about,

56
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:34,267
they’ll be householders, and they will find the truth.”

57
00:12:35,142 --> 00:12:37,808
This has been prophesized long time back,

58
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:42,017
and also there’s a book about it, a book;

59
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:47,184
as you must have read in the book which says

60
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:52,142
that the time has come for people  to know themselves.

61
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,184
Every religion has said one thing,

62
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:59,933
that you must know yourself.

63
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:05,476
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

64
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:11,017
Christians say the same, Hindus say the same.

65
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:20,225
So till then they go on doing all kinds of acrobats,

66
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:26,808
but they realize that “we haven’t found the truth.”

67
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,142
So it came to My lot;

68
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,100
from My childhood I knew I had to do it.

69
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:42,100
But when I saw the human beings,

70
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:47,267
how much in darkness they were about themselves,

71
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,309
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

72
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:59,184
all their style was so cruel

73
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:02,392
that it was unbelievable.

74
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:07,184
That was the time also I saw Hitler coming up,

75
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:14,892
and our country also was in complete bondage.

76
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:23,267
So the first thing was to make our country free,

77
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:31,058
was very important. And that’s why I took a very, very active role

78
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,058
in the movement that was for the freedom of our country;

79
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:40,975
same with My father and mother.

80
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:50,184
But when we got the freedom somehow, after some time we got lost.

81
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:56,142
People started taking to all kinds of modern things

82
00:14:56,476 --> 00:15:00,975
which were wrong, which were so-called entertaining.

83
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,225
With all that, I found all over the world

84
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:13,350
there was a big seeking force,

85
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,892
and some false people took full advantage of it.

86
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,058
They went out, made lots and lots of money,

87
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,434
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

88
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,476
I don’t know what they did to them.

89
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,476
So many seekers were lost like that.

90
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:37,017
Despite that I went to America, and I was shocked

91
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,808
how the things were going on there.

92
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,392
But I couldn’t help it because they were so

93
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:49,184
mentally  ill-equipped,

94
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:53,892
they could not understand what they have to have,

95
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,267
and you can't pay for the truth.

96
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:05,892
Then it happened that I had started it after

97
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:11,850
the Sahasrara was broken. And you know the story

98
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,434
how I broke the Sahasrara,

99
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:22,933
and how from one person I started giving realization.

100
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,476
But from America I got very disappointed.

101
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,142
I was thinking, “How will it grow? How will it work out?”

102
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:38,350
We had about twenty-five people who were realized souls by then

103
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:46,017
in India,  but they realized what they have got by realization.

104
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:51,476
They realized that they have become very good people,

105
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,392
they have given up all bad habits;

106
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:00,058
and they were wanting to worship Me.

107
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:04,017
I said, “No, no, don’t worship Me

108
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:08,434
because people will not understand.”

109
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,225
But they one day forced Me.

110
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:14,850
So on our terrace of the house they came

111
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,017
and worshipped Me,  because

112
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,309
somebody had told them, “This is the Goddess.”

113
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:27,350
So what had happened was after the program

114
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,392
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

115
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,267
And she came and she started calling Me

116
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:38,309
by the name of “Goddess.”

117
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,767
So people said, “What are you saying?”

118
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,975
She was a woman, but talking like a man.

119
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:48,309
So she said, “I’m telling you the truth.

120
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,100
She is the Goddess who has come to save us.”

121
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,476
Her language was not that of a maidservant

122
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:03,850
but of a very well-educated brahmin,

123
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:08,267
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s stotras.

124
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:13,225
It was very surprising. So they asked her several questions

125
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,392
and then she just fainted.

126
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,267
So I told them, “Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

127
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,184
But they would not agree,

128
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,434
and they said, “Mother, we have to worship You.”

129
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:27,309
So somehow I agreed to that,

130
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:33,142
and they got hold of seven brahmins to do that.

131
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,808
They were afraid because to do that puja it’s very dangerous

132
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,808
and it could harm you, if it is not the truth.

133
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:48,058
But on the contrary when they were doing  the puja

134
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,476
they got their realization.

135
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:53,184
And they just said, “Now, this is the truth.

136
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,767
” They felt the cool breeze in their hand,

137
00:18:57,058 --> 00:19:00,892
all the symptoms told about a realized soul started.

138
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,808
But I didn’t want to say everything at that time,

139
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,975
because

140
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,350
there were many others who were saying, “I am this, I am that,”

141
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:19,100
so I didn’t want to sort of expose it altogether.

142
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,017
But gradually I found that

143
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:26,267
people got attracted and they used to come to My program,

144
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,267
and then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

145
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:36,142
allover in a very interesting manner.

146
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:39,392
So this Sahasrara

147
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:45,100
Day, or we can call the day when the Sahasrara was opened out,

148
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,975
is a very important.

149
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,892
It’s very subtle. We just know about the kundalini,

150
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,142
that she’s coiled up in three-and-a-half

151
00:19:57,392 --> 00:20:00,850
and she’s lying in the triangular bone

152
00:20:01,184 --> 00:20:03,267
known as sacrum.

153
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:07,267
But we don’t know what she works, how she works,

154
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,392
or what happens to us.

155
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,267
She rises in six centers

156
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:21,142
and breaks the seventh center, I should say breaks the sixth center

157
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:26,309
because Ganesha’s center doesn’t play any role

158
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:32,975
so when she breaks the sixth center which is the Sahasrara,

159
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:39,434
then she connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love.

160
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:49,850
But what is this divine love?

161
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,892
What does this do?

162
00:20:53,892 --> 00:21:00,975
It is the energy of the Mother,

163
00:21:01,892 --> 00:21:05,975
we can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti

164
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:13,184
which is all over, works through vibrations.

165
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,392
But what are these vibrations?

166
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,267
It’s a very subtle energy that

167
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:25,808
starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

168
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:30,392
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara

169
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:33,434
get slowly enlightened

170
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:36,892
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

171
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:43,434
throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body.

172
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,892
And the more you are,

173
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,892
I mean your attention is on the Sahasrara,

174
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,476
the more it works faster.

175
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,309
Now in the science I’ve read

176
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:04,100
that they have discovered an energy called, they call it …

177
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:12,058
I don’t know how it – ask the scientists that!

178
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,100
What energy?

179
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:22,267
quantum hah,  quantum energy.

180
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:25,808
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it quantum,

181
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:29,267
because “quantum” means four.

182
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,309
” So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha maybe,

183
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,808
I don’t know. Because scientists are blind people,

184
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,808
I don’t know what they call what!

185
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,975
So they are saying there’s a quantum energy.

186
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:45,476
Now this quantum energy

187
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:50,808
according to them flows in a very subtle manner,

188
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:56,434
and it is normally not visible but it has light.

189
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,476
You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine

190
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:05,808
there’s light of all kind.

191
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,850
This energy moves in a light,

192
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:13,350
so this is the quantum energy, I think – again I am not very sure,

193
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:16,017
because scientists are, I’ve always found them

194
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,808
just a little bit vague.

195
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,933
But this quantum energy they’re talking about

196
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,975
is something like  the spiritual energy

197
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:26,184
or the energy of love,

198
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:31,058
which flows around. And this quantum energy,

199
00:23:32,476 --> 00:23:37,434
they do not know what it does but they have seen it has got light.

200
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,767
They call it “quantum” because according to them

201
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,309
it flows in bundles,

202
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:46,892
and every bundle is a “quanta” according to them.

203
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:53,476
Now this energy when it flows, as you have seen yourself, it works.

204
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,850
It works in every direction, in every dimension.

205
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,476
For example it works physically.

206
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,309
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

207
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:08,100
you have seen many people get cured in My presence,

208
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:11,892
just in My presence – I need not do anything to them.

209
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:17,017
Or also as soon as I see somebody, I know what he’s suffering from.

210
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:22,476
That’s also, I must say, My connection with the Divine;

211
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,350
and that tells Me what’s wrong with what person

212
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:31,975
and what should be done, and it can be cured in no time.

213
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:35,850
Because that also comes to Me just like that. I mean,

214
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,184
I don’t ask any questions,  I don’t try to find out,

215
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:42,892
I do not analyze, but it just says, “Do like this”

216
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:47,476
or it also doesn’t say, it just does.

217
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:50,933
It just works automatically.

218
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:55,350
It is very difficult to explain how this energy works.

219
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:58,434
But all of you who have got realization

220
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:01,933
can also work out your own energies.

221
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:08,058
How? By releasing it, by feeling it,

222
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:15,476
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

223
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,434
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only.

224
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,184
You are the people who have brought people to Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,434
But that’s not the end of it. We have to save this world.

226
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:34,808
For that at least I feel forty percent

227
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,933
of people should get their realization.

228
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:39,975
Whatever may be their nationality,

229
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:43,309
whatever may be their education, anything,

230
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:52,184
they are to be given Self-realization. In our Indian

231
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:58,892
scriptures it’s clearly written, “Without Atmasakshatkar

232
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:03,058
your life is useless.” But what is Atmasakshatkar,

233
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:07,392
is the knowledge about yourself. How can you have that knowledge

234
00:26:07,808 --> 00:26:12,767
unless and until you become one with this all-pervading Power?

235
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:18,309
So it was a very great thing, I felt, that this Sahasrara

236
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:22,892
I could open in 1970.

237
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:27,975
I realized I was overwhelmed

238
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:31,892
because I knew this is the only trouble,

239
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
it is the only obstacle human beings are having:

240
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:39,975
because their Sahasraras are not open, that’s why they are

241
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:45,267
going in the darkness, that’s why they are having wars,

242
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,267
that’s why they are having all kinds of problems.

243
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:52,142
But if their Sahasrara opens

244
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:55,184
and if they become one with the divine Power,

245
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:58,808
all their problems would be solved,

246
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,933
every type of problem will be solved

247
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,100
and they’ll be very happy people.

248
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,476
I realized it and I was very happy, I was over-joyous.

249
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,225
But nobody understood Me.

250
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:16,892
I don’t know, they thought I must be talking something nonsensical.

251
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,434
Nobody understood it what it is,

252
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:24,142
because even in the shastras it’s not written

253
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:29,142
about kundalini so clearly.

254
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:33,309
Only one great saint called Gyaneshwara

255
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:38,184
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter, about the kundalini.

256
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,850
It’s not so clear, only he said that with the kundalini

257
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,392
you can get your awakening.

258
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,434
Also you sing that song always I’ve heard,

259
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:53,142
which says that “Oh Kundalini Mother, please be awakened!”

260
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,933
But nobody knows that what this kundalini is

261
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,476
and why are you singing that song.

262
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:04,850
It was all in our country people used to sing in the village

263
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:10,434
so clearly, but nobody understood the meaning of it.

264
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:15,184
Just they used to sing as a, some sort of a bhajan or could be

265
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,100
some sort of a music concert.

266
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,142
But nobody knew what it was talking about.

267
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,100
It was such a misunderstanding about everything.

268
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:29,350
And all these poets also who have written

269
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:35,184
clearly about awakening, about realization,

270
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:38,892
everything was just in the books.

271
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:42,767
They would read one line of the book, then stop there.

272
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:45,225
Another person would start the another line,

273
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,850
then he stops at another line, point;

274
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,933
like that they were just reading.

275
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:53,892
Same thing about all the scriptures.

276
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,142
There was big misunderstanding created

277
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:03,975
and was used for the purpose of their own self-interest.

278
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,142
That is how we couldn’t get people

279
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,975
who understood what was Self-realization.

280
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:13,808
It was just for some money

281
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:18,142
or for some certain type of a position to get,

282
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:25,142
people started big, big organizations,

283
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:30,392
very big religious organizations

284
00:29:30,892 --> 00:29:32,309
I don’t know what to call them –

285
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:35,350
but none of them were realized souls.

286
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:40,476
For example, there was a great saint called Viditama

287
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:48,225
who went to China, and he started a religion called Zen.

288
00:29:49,142 --> 00:29:51,142
Zen means dhyana.

289
00:29:51,434 --> 00:29:56,267
And he wanted to put Zen

290
00:29:56,808 --> 00:30:00,767
in such a manner  that people become thoughtless

291
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:05,100
He made a big tank

292
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:10,850
full of sand with patterns and put some stones,

293
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:16,975
and he had said that “You sit on the edge of this pond

294
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:22,100
and just see, but don’t think.”

295
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:24,476
People didn’t understand what it was.

296
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,225
Normally anybody would go there and say,

297
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:32,350
“Oh, this looks like some ships in the sea,” or all kinds of things.

298
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,350
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

299
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:41,100
And I told some of them that this is for thoughtless awareness,

300
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,850
but they couldn’t understand.

301
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,350
Then we have also in Japan, Tao.

302
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,476
He talked about the all-pervading Power which was Tao,

303
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:58,476
and Lao-Tze was the one who did.

304
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,142
He had described saints: how the saints are,

305
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:06,476
how they behave, how they talk,

306
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:10,933
what is their mannerism, everything.

307
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,434
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

308
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:18,975
I think throughout there has been no description

309
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:24,808
how to make a person into a saintly personality.

310
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:49,100
So also in the twelfth century

311
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:55,184
Gyaneshwara was in the twelfth century

312
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:59,434
he talked about it and he said about it in his book, everything.

313
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,142
Because it was a kind of a

314
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:07,476
style that a guru should have only one disciple,

315
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:12,350
who should give to one disciple realization, not to many.

316
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,933
I don’t know why, what made them such a law or a rule.

317
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:21,933
And then it started in the twelfth century, there were many saints

318
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:28,767
who sang the praise of realization.

319
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,267
And all of them thought that these rituals are no good,

320
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:36,225
so they discarded rituals and this.

321
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,350
But what was the thing that had to happen, nobody knew.

322
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:45,309
I have read all their lives,

323
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,850
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who were there,

324
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:55,933
but it seems nobody knew how to raise the kundalini.

325
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,017
This was the basic problem,

326
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:01,476
they didn’t know how to raise the kundalini;

327
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:05,225
while I think they didn’t have that power,

328
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,184
or maybe they had no knowledge.

329
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,892
They talked about kundalini, all right,

330
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:14,476
but they did not know how to raise the kundalini.

331
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:20,767
This is a very special power of spirituality.

332
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,017
None of them have been able

333
00:33:24,142 --> 00:33:27,309
to say or tell you how to raise the kundalini.

334
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:30,767
Now you all have got this power,

335
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
which is such a rare thing.

336
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:35,225
All of you have got it,

337
00:33:35,392 --> 00:33:38,892
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that power

338
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,058
to raise the kundalini. You may not;

339
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:44,933
you may be contented with yourself,

340
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:47,100
but that’s not a very good thing.

341
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,933
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out

342
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:55,058
and if you know how to raise the kundalini,

343
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,267
you must go all out to give realization to people.

344
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:05,142
Nothing is going to benefit people more than Self-realization.

345
00:34:05,975 --> 00:34:09,933
No use doing other charities, giving money, giving this

346
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:14,434
is of no use. Best thing is to go all out

347
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:17,434
to see people who want their realization,

348
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:20,017
and to give them realization.

349
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,058
I was very happy to see

350
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,476
that they have started working it out on the gypsies.

351
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:29,309
I’ve a special feeling for gypsies.

352
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,892
For no fault of theirs, they are leading a very miserable life.

353
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,476
And how the gypsies got the realization!

354
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:43,017
You can see that you can give it to anyone

355
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:48,184
who wants to have it. One thing is there you cannot force on anyone.

356
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:52,100
If they have a desire,

357
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:54,892
they can get Self-realization.

358
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,142
So this day, I have to just say now so many years have passed,

359
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:02,933
I have worked quite hard, day and night,

360
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,309
and My only desire was

361
00:35:06,892 --> 00:35:11,850
that you people should take  it seriously and work it out.

362
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:14,309
Don’t keep your realization to yourself.

363
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,017
As many as people you can give realization,

364
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,184
the greatest obligation will be on Me

365
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:26,892
and on God Almighty. Only thing is you should try

366
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:29,392
to give realizations to others.

367
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:32,142
You will never make a mistake,

368
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:35,434
you can never make a mistake because the kundalini knows.

369
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:39,058
She knows you, she knows you are realized soul.

370
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,767
She’llrespect you.

371
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:44,100
Even if you make mistakes she’ll correct it

372
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,392
and she’ll help you, in every way.

373
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:52,058
I’m just a, I should say a housewife

374
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,184
who had no support from anyone.

375
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:03,142
But I was sure that it’s My job to find out

376
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,933
how to break the Sahasrara.

377
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:09,850
Whatever way it is – outside doesn’t matter –

378
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:16,142
My job it was to find out the breaking of Sahasrara, which I did.

379
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:20,808
Now you also know that, so this is your job.

380
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:22,975
And the scientists now will be coming around

381
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:24,808
you to ask you questions,

382
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,184
because they don’t know what they are talking about is

383
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:30,476
what we are already doing.

384
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,058
So you are so powerful, all of you. But how many of you are really

385
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,476
doing this work, is the point.

386
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:42,309
Today is a very important day. I want to tell you

387
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:47,434
that you have to strengthen My hands.

388
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:51,808
They say the Goddess has one thousand hands,

389
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:56,225
but even the one thousand hands are now asking

390
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:00,142
that you come along with your two hands and work it out.

391
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:02,933
It’s very important what you have to do.

392
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:09,392
All kinds of problems in this world, they come because of ignorance

393
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,267
take it politics, take it any, any problem.

394
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:16,058
And how it is solved is also,

395
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:21,434
is your power with the Divine.

396
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:24,808
I’ll give you one simple example.

397
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:28,142
That day the Turkish people came

398
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,975
and were begging of Me, “Mother,

399
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:32,975
You must come. You should not postpone,”

400
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,267
and this passport, My passport was a problem.  I said,

401
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:39,392
“The passport is not ready, how will I come?”

402
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:43,350
But then I thought, “Why not? We’ll have the passport also done.”

403
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,476
So passport was ready.

404
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,309
And they wanted Me to go to Turkey because they said,

405
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,350
“The financial condition has gone down very much,

406
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:54,392
the economy has gone down absolutely, we are ruined.”

407
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:58,808
I went there, I didn’t do anything about it;

408
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:03,100
within two days they announced

409
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:06,476
ten billion dollar help from the World Bank.

410
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,225
Now I didn’t talk to World Bank, I had nothing to do with them,

411
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,350
I don’t know.

412
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,225
Then I said, “No, maybe you see, they are helping because

413
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:19,184
you people are in such trouble.

414
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:21,100
” They said, “But so many countries are,

415
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,392
why have they helped us only?”

416
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,017
I said, “That’s the point!”

417
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,225
So now I was surprised, in Turkey

418
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:32,975
there are only ladies mostly who are leaders, mostly,

419
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,017
and they have done such a big job.

420
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:40,309
Now I want to see what you people are doing in your country.

421
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,975
You may say that “In my country the people are hopelessly bad.”

422
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:47,309
Maybe, I don’t say no.

423
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:51,434
But still there are places, there are pockets

424
00:38:52,142 --> 00:38:55,267
where you can go and talk to them, tell them,

425
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,058
specially the media you must handle.

426
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:05,184
It is something you have to do, and find out why you can’t do it.

427
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:09,975
Like Me: I was not supported by anybody,

428
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:11,476
not helped by anybody,

429
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:15,350
and how I have managed to break the Sahasrara –

430
00:39:15,892 --> 00:39:18,350
you can also break the Sahasraras of others.

431
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:22,476
It’s not difficult, because My vision is

432
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:25,350
that this world

433
00:39:25,892 --> 00:39:29,476
at least should have forty percent people who are realized souls

434
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:34,392
and who are practicing Sahaja Yoga,

435
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:38,267
who are giving realization to people

436
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:41,892
and trying to change the people.

437
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,808
Anybody who can go and tell, anybody.

438
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,434
There’s no need to discriminate

439
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,933
or to find out, or sit down with their

440
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:54,184
I mean people take sometimes the

441
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:59,975
copy of their education and this; that's not needed.

442
00:40:01,142 --> 00:40:03,350
Whosoever it is.

443
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,267
I’m not saying give it to dogs or to animals,

444
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,476
but to human beings. They may be anything;

445
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,975
they may be English or they could be Germans,

446
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:23,808
they could be Italians anywhere.

447
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:26,350
I am told also some people

448
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:29,267
are doing lots of seminars and working very hard

449
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,892
on all levels, and it is working out.

450
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:36,100
Among Muslims also we have started working,

451
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,933
and even in India it has worked.

452
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,392
You don’t know, people have not lost all their heads,

453
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:44,392
so it can work out.

454
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:48,434
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset about it;

455
00:40:49,309 --> 00:40:53,058
gradually it will improve. I think the greatest enemy

456
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,017
of our Self-realization is the drinking.

457
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,850
Drinking, if people take to drinking they become such slaves,

458
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:06,184
they don’t – their brains are not all right.

459
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:11,392
So I think the Sahasrara also must be spoilt with drinking.

460
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,434
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

461
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,017
And if you could find anybody drinking,

462
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,142
if you could help that man to give up drinking itself,

463
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:25,434
it will work out.  Of course we have other enemies also,

464
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:30,309
like false gurus are there. Also we have other enemies

465
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:37,392
who are having some sort of religious manipulations,

466
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:39,808
but that’s not so important.

467
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:43,225
If you can get hold of people who are drinking,

468
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:48,892
I tell you it will change. And they will now understand

469
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:52,017
that what they have been doing so far, drinking,

470
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:54,933
running away – now they’ll come

471
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,808
to the fields and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:03,100
So you are like very gentle soldiers of love,

473
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:06,267
and that’s what you have to spread

474
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:10,975
and talk to others, give them that joy that you have.

475
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:16,392
Not be satisfied if you have got it only, or few of you have it.

476
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,933
You have to spread it very fast, and you can do it.

477
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:24,184
Because it doesn’t require money, it doesn’t require any show;

478
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:27,933
it is just inside, it works, it’s already there.

479
00:42:28,267 --> 00:42:31,808
It’s present there, everybody has it. I knew all that,

480
00:42:32,142 --> 00:42:35,225
of course I knew it; but now you also know it.

481
00:42:35,434 --> 00:42:39,017
So you should work it out, and work it out in the manner

482
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:44,476
that I am sure one day this world will be a changed place.

483
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:47,184
Thank you very much.
