1
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:10,755
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis who
have found the Truth.

2
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:23,647
There has been, from ages, the seeking
for the Truth.

3
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:33,040
And when people discovered that there’s
no other way

4
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:42,306
but to surrender to the Divine that you
can find the truth,

5
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:47,964
they did not know how to do it, how
to work it out.

6
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:53,782
There have been seekers all over the world.

7
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,225
I went to Turkey and I was amazed

8
00:08:56,426 --> 00:08:59,646
there have been lots of Sufis,

9
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:03,697
but their disciples were not realised
souls.

10
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:05,876
Because the Sufis also did not know

11
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:08,836
how they got their Realisation.

12
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:17,102
Such darkness existed around people who
were seeking.

13
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:24,491
All over the world, I find, when I was
a little girl,

14
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:34,074
that they are completely ignorant about
how to find the Truth.

15
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:38,700
So many were lost in all kinds

16
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:44,129
of so-called religions and rituals.

17
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:47,329
All kinds of rituals they used to do.

18
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:52,977
Morning till evening, some sort of a ritual
they would do.

19
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:56,889
Whether they were Hindus, Christians,
Muslims,

20
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,641
they all believed that by doing all these
rituals

21
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:05,181
you will achieve something, that you will
know the Truth,

22
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:08,459
that you will get your Self-realisation.

23
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:16,273
All such seekers went to wrong people

24
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:19,613
and to wrong directions

25
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:24,338
because they were really seeking from
their heart.

26
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:30,540
So they were very misleading, misleading

27
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:41,428
and they were misled into such horrible
black areas

28
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,720
that they did not know what they were
seeking,

29
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:49,115
what they are supposed to seek, what they
have to have.

30
00:10:51,136 --> 00:11:00,216
It has been prophesised that when Kali
Yuga will come,

31
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,807
people will find themselves.

32
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:10,330
There is a story about Nala and Kali,

33
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:22,935
who had taken away the wife, Damayanti,
of Nala.

34
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:34,214
So, once Nala caught hold of him, and he
said that: “Now I’m going to kill you,

35
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:41,512
because you are a very mischievous man,
and you have done such a harm to me.”

36
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:48,551
So the Kali said: “You can kill me, but
before that you should know

37
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:52,938
what is my importance, what is my Mahatmya.

38
00:11:53,139 --> 00:12:00,444
And my importance is that when my time
will come –

39
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:03,511
when Kali Yuga will come –

40
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:08,249
then all those people who are seeking
the Truth

41
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:19,857
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,
in the Himalayas,

42
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:23,834
will become ordinary householders,

43
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:29,456
they’ll be householders – they won’t be
sanyasis going about –

44
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:35,189
they’ll be householders, and they will
find the Truth”.

45
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,019
This has been prophesised long time back,

46
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,143
and also there’s a book about it, a big
book (Nala Purana)

47
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:47,330
as you must have read in the book, which
says that:

48
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:54,601
“The time has come for people to know
themselves.”

49
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:57,467
Every religion has said one thing,

50
00:12:57,668 --> 00:13:01,129
that – “You must know yourself.”

51
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:06,779
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

52
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,227
Christians say the same, Hindus say
the same.

53
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:22,255
So, till then, they go on doing all kinds
of acrobats,

54
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:28,975
but [finally] they realise that – we
haven’t found the Truth.

55
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:35,769
So it came to my lot,

56
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,572
from my childhood I knew I had to do it.

57
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,894
But when I saw the human beings,

58
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:48,354
how much in darkness they were about
themselves,

59
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:54,471
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

60
00:13:54,672 --> 00:14:03,791
all their style was so cruel that it was
unbelievable.

61
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:08,256
That was the time also I saw Hitler
coming up.

62
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:17,022
And our country also was in complete
bondage.

63
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:24,568
So the first thing was to make our country
free,

64
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:31,977
was very important, and that’s why
I took a very, very active role

65
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:38,196
in the movement that was for the freedom
of our country;

66
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:42,486
same with my father, mother.

67
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:46,529
But when we got the freedom, somehow,

68
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,564
after some time we got lost.

69
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:58,289
People started taking to all kinds of
modern things which were wrong,

70
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,968
which were so-called entertaining.

71
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:09,218
With all that, I found (that) all over
the world

72
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:14,540
there was a big seeking force,

73
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:19,149
and some false people took full
advantage of it.

74
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,725
They went out and made lots and lots
of money,

75
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:26,511
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

76
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,935
I don’t know what they did to them.

77
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,671
So many seekers were lost like that.

78
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:37,437
Despite that, I went to America and I was
shocked

79
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:42,352
how the things were going on there.
But I couldn’t help it,

80
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:49,374
because they were so mentally ill-equipped,

81
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:54,231
they could not understand what they have
to have,

82
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:58,400
and you can’t pay for the Truth.

83
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:10,074
Then it happened that I had started it
after the Sahasrara was broken.

84
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:16,573
And you know the story of how I broke
the Sahasrara,

85
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:23,860
and how, from one person, I started
giving Realization.

86
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:27,649
But from America I got very disappointed.

87
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,909
I was thinking: “How will it grow? How will
it work out?”

88
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:41,040
We had about 25 people who were realised
souls by then, in India.

89
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:46,852
But they realised what they have got
by Realization,

90
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:52,852
they realised that they had become
very good people.

91
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,240
They had given up all bad habits,

92
00:16:56,441 --> 00:17:04,525
and they were wanting to worship me.
I said: “No, no. Don’t worship me

93
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:11,894
because people will not understand”. But
one day they forced me.

94
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:16,133
So on our terrace of the house they came
and worshipped me

95
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:21,300
because somebody had told them, “This is
the Goddess.”

96
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:28,369
So, what had happened was after
the programme

97
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,188
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

98
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:39,102
And she came and she started calling me
by the name of ‘Goddess’.

99
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:42,143
So people said: “What are you saying?”

100
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:45,852
She was a woman but talking like a man.

101
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:48,810
So she said: “I’m telling you the truth,

102
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:53,305
She is the Goddess who has come to save
us.”

103
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:57,699
Her language was not that of a maidservant,

104
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,437
but of a very well-educated Brahmin

105
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:08,692
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s
stotras.

106
00:18:08,893 --> 00:18:13,661
It was very surprising! So they asked her
several questions

107
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:19,761
and then she just fainted. So I told them:
“Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

108
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,887
But they would not agree, and they said:

109
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:27,810
“Mother, we have to worship you.” So
somehow I agreed to that

110
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:33,977
and they got hold of seven Brahmins to do
that.

111
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:39,146
They were afraid because to do that Puja,

112
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:45,534
it’s very dangerous and it could harm you
if it is not the Truth.

113
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:50,406
But on the contrary, when they were doing
the Puja, they got their Realization,

114
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:54,009
and they just said: “Now, this is
the Truth!”

115
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,849
They felt the cool breeze in their hands.

116
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,765
All the symptoms told about a realised
soul started.

117
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:10,705
But I didn’t want to say everything at that
time, because

118
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:14,844
there were many others saying: “I am this…
I am that…”

119
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:19,316
So I didn’t want to expose it altogether.

120
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:23,636
But gradually I had found that people got
attracted

121
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:27,286
and they used to come to my programme.

122
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:31,343
And then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

123
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:37,387
all over, in a very interesting manner.

124
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:42,098
So this Sahasrara Day or, we can say,

125
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,859
on the day the Sahasrara was opened out,

126
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,546
is a very important one, it’s very subtle.

127
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:57,341
We just know about the Kundalini, that
She’s coiled up in three and a half,

128
00:19:57,542 --> 00:20:04,284
and She’s lying in the triangular bone
known as Sacrum.

129
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:11,353
But we don’t know what She works, how She
works, what happens to us.

130
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:18,592
She rises in six centres and breaks
the seventh…

131
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:21,850
I should say She breaks the sixth centre,

132
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:26,522
because Ganesha’s centre doesn’t play
any role.

133
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:34,061
So when She breaks the sixth centre, which
is the Sahasrara,

134
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:41,714
then She connects you to the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love.

135
00:20:43,018 --> 00:20:53,769
But what is this Divine Love? What does
this do?

136
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:01,679
It is the energy of the Mother.

137
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,644
We can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti,

138
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:14,345
which is all over, works through
vibrations.

139
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:18,186
But what are these vibrations?

140
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,507
It’s a very subtle energy

141
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:27,618
that starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

142
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:33,840
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara
get slowly enlightened

143
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,102
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

144
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:44,810
throughout your hands, feet, throughout
your body.

145
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:53,311
And the more you are… I mean your attention
is, on the Sahasrara,

146
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,977
the more it works faster.

147
00:21:57,178 --> 00:22:01,732
Now in the science I’ve read that they
have discovered

148
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:06,319
an energy called, they call it… what you
call that?

149
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:12,856
I don’t know, because it was the scientists
that...

150
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:17,480
Forget it, is the… (From the audience:
“Quantum”)

151
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:22,884
What energy? Quantum ha! Quantum Energy.

152
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:25,850
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it
Quantum,

153
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,935
because Quantum is four.

154
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:35,349
So it might be meaning the energy of
Ganesha, maybe, I don’t know.

155
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,666
Because scientists are blind people,

156
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:40,332
I don’t know what they call what.

157
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,525
So they are saying there is a quantum
energy.

158
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:50,830
Now this Quantum Energy, according to them,
flows, in a very subtle manner

159
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:57,151
and it is normally not visible, but it has
light.

160
00:22:57,352 --> 00:23:02,783
You have seen that in so many of
photographs of mine,

161
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:06,414
there’s light of all kind.

162
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:09,311
This energy moves in a light.

163
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:13,557
So this is the Quantum Energy I think
again, I am not very sure,

164
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:17,905
because scientists, I have always found
them little bit vague.

165
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,168
But this quantum energy they are talking
about

166
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:24,018
is something like the spiritual energy

167
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:28,820
or the energy of love, which flows around.

168
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:35,059
And this Quantum Energy, they do not know
what it does,

169
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,019
but they have seen it has got light.

170
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,601
They call it Quantum because, according
to them,

171
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:48,061
it flows in bundles, and every bundle is
a quanta, according to them.

172
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:54,274
Now this energy, when it flows, as you have
seen yourself, it works.

173
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,282
It works in every direction, in every
dimension.

174
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:01,810
For example it works physically.

175
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:05,108
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

176
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,311
you have seen many people get cured
in my presence –

177
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:12,318
just in my presence. I need not do anything
to them.

178
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,685
Or also, as soon as I see somebody, I know
what he is suffering from.

179
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:21,437
That’s also, I must say, my connection

180
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:26,151
with the Divine, and that tells me what’s
wrong

181
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:29,633
with what person and what should be done.

182
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,464
And it can be cured in no time

183
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:35,305
because that also comes to me just like
that.

184
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,572
I mean, I don’t ask any questions,

185
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,834
I don’t try to find out, I do not analyse,

186
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:43,206
but it just says: “Do like this.”

187
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:48,193
Or, it also doesn’t say, it just does.

188
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:52,499
It just works automatically. It is very
difficult

189
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,894
to explain how this energy works.

190
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,019
But all of you who have got Realisation

191
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:03,831
can also work out your own energies. How?

192
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:11,755
By releasing it, by feeling it,

193
00:25:11,956 --> 00:25:17,153
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

194
00:25:17,354 --> 00:25:22,057
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because
of you only.

195
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:25,593
You are the people that have brought people
to Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:30,693
But that’s not the end of it. We have
to save this world.

197
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:37,565
For that at least I feel 40% of people
should get their Realisation.

198
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:44,402
Whatever may be their nationality, whatever
may be their education, anything.

199
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:49,169
They are to be given Self-realisation.

200
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:56,515
In our Indian scriptures it is clearly
written:

201
00:25:56,715 --> 00:26:00,762
“Without Atma Sakshatkar, your life is
useless.”

202
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:05,476
But what is Atma Sakshatkar? It’s
the knowledge about yourself.

203
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,598
How can you have that knowledge,

204
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:13,406
unless and until you become one with this
All-pervading Power?

205
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,539
So it was a very great thing I felt

206
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,178
that this Sahasrara I could open in 1970.

207
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:28,168
I realised I was overwhelmed,

208
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,738
because I knew this is the only trouble,

209
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:35,398
it is the only obstacle human beings are
having.

210
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,480
Because their Sahasraras are not open,

211
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:45,702
that’s why they are going in the darkness,
that’s why they are having wars,

212
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:49,444
that’s why they are having all kinds
of problems.

213
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:52,440
But if their Sahasrara opens

214
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:56,205
and if they become one with the Divine
Power,

215
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,310
all their problems will be solved,

216
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:02,102
every type of problem will be solved

217
00:27:02,303 --> 00:27:04,619
and they will be very happy people.

218
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,179
I realised it and I was very happy, I was
over-joyous,

219
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,715
but nobody understood me.

220
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:17,244
I don’t know, they thought I must be
talking something nonsensical.

221
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,754
Nobody understood it, what it is.

222
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:26,001
Because even in the Shastras it’s not
written

223
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:29,645
about Kundalini so clearly.

224
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:33,883
Only one great saint called Jnaneshwara

225
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:38,727
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter
about the Kundalini.

226
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:43,057
It’s not so clear, only he said that: “With
the Kundalini,

227
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:45,670
you can get your awakening.”

228
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,729
Also you sing that song always [“Jogawa”,
“Ude bai”] I’ve heard,

229
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,727
which says that: “Oh, Kundalini Mother,
please be awakened!”

230
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:58,111
But nobody knows that what this Kundalini
is

231
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:01,061
and why are you singing that song.

232
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:05,574
It was all in our country, people used
to sing in the village.

233
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:10,809
So clearly, but nobody understood
the meaning of it.

234
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,330
Just they used to sing as a, some sort
of a bhajan,

235
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:18,178
or could be some sort of a music concert,

236
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:21,629
but nobody knew what it was talking about.

237
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,687
It was such a misunderstanding about
everything.

238
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:29,685
And [for] all these poets, also, who have
written

239
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:35,685
clearly about awakening, about Realisation,

240
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:39,179
everything was just in the books.

241
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,845
They would read one line of the book, then
stop there.

242
00:28:43,046 --> 00:28:45,376
Another person would start another line,

243
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:50,061
then he stops at another point – like that
they were just reading.

244
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:54,361
Same thing about all the scriptures.

245
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:59,991
There was big misunderstanding created
and was used

246
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:04,752
for the purpose of their own self-interest.

247
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:08,297
That is how we couldn’t get people

248
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:11,721
who understood what was Self-realisation.

249
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:18,356
It was just for some money, or for some
certain type of a position to get,

250
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:25,769
people started big, big organisations,

251
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:30,649
very big religious organisations –

252
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,390
I don’t know what to call them – but none
of them were realised souls.

253
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:44,843
For example, there was a great saint called
Viditama who went to China (Japan),

254
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:49,067
and he started a religion called Zen.

255
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:51,445
Zen means dhyana.

256
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:57,543
And he wanted to put Zen in such a manner

257
00:29:57,744 --> 00:30:01,769
that people become thoughtless.

258
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:11,475
He made a big tank full of sand with
patterns, and put some stones

259
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:17,441
and he had said that: “You sit on the edge
of this pond

260
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:24,703
and just see but don’t think.” But people
didn’t understand what it was.

261
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:27,186
Normally anybody would go there and say,

262
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:32,759
“Oh, this looks like some ships in
the sea,” or all kinds of things.

263
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,061
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

264
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:39,464
And I told some of them that, “This is for

265
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:44,609
thoughtless awareness”, but they
couldn’t understand.

266
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:50,865
Then we have also in Japan (China) – Tao.

267
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:55,409
He talked about the All-pervading Power,
which is Tao.

268
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,555
And Lao-Tse was the one who did… He had
described saints,

269
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:07,287
how the saints are, how they behave,
how they talk,

270
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:11,144
what is their mannerism, everything.

271
00:31:11,345 --> 00:31:15,137
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

272
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:19,141
I think, throughout, there has been no
description

273
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:26,926
how to make a person into a saintly
personality.

274
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:55,685
So also in the twelfth century, Jnaneshwara
was in the twelfth century [i.e. 1200s],

275
00:31:55,886 --> 00:32:00,289
he talked about it, and he said about it
in his book everything.

276
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,164
Because it was a kind of a style

277
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:08,186
that a guru should have only one disciple,

278
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:12,627
who should give to one disciple
Realisation, not to many.

279
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:17,552
I don’t know why, what made them such
a law, or a rule.

280
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:24,011
And then it started in the twelfth century,
there were many saints

281
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:30,033
who sang the praise of Realisation.

282
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:33,598
And all of them thought that these rituals
are no good,

283
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,573
so they discarded rituals and this –

284
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:41,609
but what was the thing that had to happen,
nobody knew.

285
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,790
I have read all their lives,

286
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:51,102
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who
were there,

287
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:56,852
but it seems nobody knew how to raise
the Kundalini.

288
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:02,481
This was the basic problem – they didn’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

289
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:05,739
While, I think, they didn’t have that
power,

290
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,242
or maybe they had no knowledge.

291
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:11,005
They talked about Kundalini, alright,

292
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:16,328
but they did not know how to raise
the Kundalini.

293
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:21,509
This is a very special power
of spirituality.

294
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,762
None of them have been able to say

295
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,897
or tell you how to raise the Kundalini.

296
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:30,927
Now you all have got this power,

297
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:35,210
which is such a rare thing. All of you have
got it.

298
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:40,593
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that
power to raise the Kundalini.

299
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:44,899
You may not [use it], you may be contented
with yourself,

300
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,269
but that’s not a very good thing.

301
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:52,242
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out,

302
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:55,194
and if you know how to raise the Kundalini,

303
00:33:55,395 --> 00:34:00,311
you must go all out to give Realisation
to people.

304
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:06,032
Nothing is going to benefit people more
than Self-realisation.

305
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:11,974
No use doing other charities, giving money,
giving this – is of no use.

306
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:15,830
Best thing is to go all out to see people

307
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:20,020
who want their Realization and to give
them Realization.

308
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:27,030
I was very happy to see that they have
started working it out on the Gypsies.

309
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,779
I have a special feeling for Gypsies.

310
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,141
For no fault of theirs, they are leading
a very miserable life.

311
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:38,566
And how the Gypsies got the Realization,

312
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:45,783
you can see that you can give it to anyone
who wants to have it.

313
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:49,316
One thing is there, you cannot force
on anyone.

314
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:54,839
If they have a desire, a pure desire,
they can get Self-realization.

315
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,398
So this day, I have to just say now so many
years have passed.

316
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,633
I’ve worked quite hard, day and night,

317
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:07,780
and my only desire was that you people

318
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:11,771
should take it seriously and work it out.

319
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:14,708
Don’t keep your Realisation to yourself.

320
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:18,355
As many as people you can give
Realisation (to),

321
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:24,708
the greatest obligation will be on me, and
on God Almighty.

322
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:29,804
Only thing is you should try to give
Realization to others.

323
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:32,204
You will never make a mistake.

324
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:35,979
You can never make a mistake, because
the Kundalini knows.

325
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,235
She knows you, She knows you are
a realised soul.

326
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,801
She’ll respect you. Even if you make
mistakes,

327
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:48,680
She’ll correct it and She’ll help you in
every way.

328
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:59,153
I’m just a, I should say, a housewife who
had no support from anyone.

329
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:06,731
But I was sure that it’s my job to find out
how to break the Sahasrara.

330
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:10,180
Whatever way it is, outside doesn’t matter,

331
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:16,416
my job was to find out the breaking
of Sahasrara, which I did.

332
00:36:16,617 --> 00:36:20,828
Now you also know that. So this is your
job.

333
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:24,957
And the scientists now will be coming round
you to ask you questions,

334
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:28,520
because they don’t know what they are
talking about

335
00:36:28,721 --> 00:36:33,872
is what we are already doing. So, you are
so powerful all of you.

336
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:39,186
But how many of you are really doing this
work, is the point?

337
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:43,061
Today is a very important day. I want
to tell you

338
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:49,019
that you have to strengthen my hands.

339
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,280
They say the Goddess has one thousand
hands,

340
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:56,227
but even the one thousand hands are now
asking

341
00:36:56,428 --> 00:37:00,550
that you come along with your two hands
and work it out.

342
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,736
Is very important what you have to do.

343
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:10,186
All kinds of problems in this world – they
come because of ignorance,

344
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:13,780
take it politics, take it any problem.

345
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:22,102
And how it is solved is also is your power
with the Divine.

346
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:25,061
I will give you one simple example,

347
00:37:25,262 --> 00:37:30,624
that the Turkish people came and were
begging of me,

348
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:33,124
“Mother, You must come, You should not
postpone.”

349
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,631
And my passport was a problem.

350
00:37:35,832 --> 00:37:40,090
I said, “The passport is not ready, how
will I come?”

351
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,810
But then I thought: “Why not? We’ll have
the passport also done.”

352
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,202
So passport was ready.

353
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:49,043
And they wanted me to go to Turkey, because
they said,

354
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,511
“The financial condition has gone down
very much,

355
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:55,559
the economy has gone down absolutely.
We are ruined.”

356
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,402
I went there, I didn’t do anything
about it,

357
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:07,392
within two days, they announced ten billion
dollar help from the World Bank.

358
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:09,640
Now I didn’t talk to the World Bank,

359
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:13,554
I had nothing to do with them. I don’t
know.

360
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:16,546
Then I said, “No, maybe, you see, they are
helping

361
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,128
because you people are in such trouble.”

362
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,144
They said: “But so many countries are,

363
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:24,269
why have they helped us only?”

364
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,227
I said: “That’s the point!”

365
00:38:26,428 --> 00:38:29,300
So now, I was surprised in Turkey

366
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:33,554
there are only ladies, mostly, who are
leaders, mostly,

367
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,203
and they have done such a big job.

368
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:40,935
Now, I want to see what you people are
doing in your country.

369
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:45,108
You may say that: “In my country,
the people are hopelessly bad.”

370
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,504
Maybe, I don’t say no.

371
00:38:47,705 --> 00:38:51,970
But, still there are places, there are
pockets

372
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:55,469
where you can go and talk to them, tell
them.

373
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,120
Especially the media you must handle.

374
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:05,759
It is something you have to do and find out
why you can’t do it.

375
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,904
I was not supported by anybody, not helped
by anybody,

376
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:15,657
and how I managed to break the Sahasrara,

377
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:19,268
you can also break the Sahasraras
of others.

378
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:23,054
It is not difficult, because my vision is

379
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:28,154
that this world at least should have 40%
people

380
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:35,102
who are realised souls and who are
practising Sahaja Yoga,

381
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:42,857
who are giving Realization to people and
trying to change the people.

382
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:46,162
Anybody you can go and tell, anybody.

383
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:50,988
There’s no need to discriminate or to find
out or sit down with their…

384
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:59,068
I mean people take sometimes the copy
of their education and this and that –

385
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:03,695
that’s not needed. Whosoever it is.

386
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:07,835
I’m not saying to give it to dogs or
to animals,

387
00:40:08,036 --> 00:40:12,949
but to human beings, wherever they are.
They may be anything.

388
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:24,344
They may be English, or they could be
Germans, they could be Italians, anywhere.

389
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:29,907
I am told also some people are doing lots
of seminars and working very hard,

390
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:33,220
on all levels, and it is working out.

391
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:36,409
Among Muslims also, we have started
working.

392
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,527
And even in India it has worked.

393
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:44,585
You don’t know, people have not lost all
their heads, so it can work out.

394
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:49,230
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset
about it.

395
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,157
Gradually it will improve.

396
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:59,040
I think the greatest enemy of our
Self-realisation is the drinking.

397
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:03,272
Drinking, if people take to drinking, they
become such slaves

398
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:06,873
ki (that) their brains are not alright.

399
00:41:07,074 --> 00:41:11,766
So I think at Sahasrara also must be spoilt
with drinking.

400
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:15,279
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

401
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,149
And if you could find anybody drinking,

402
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,017
if you could help that man to give up
drinking itself, it will work out.

403
00:41:23,218 --> 00:41:28,214
Of course, we have other enemies also,
like false gurus are there.

404
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:33,388
Also we have other enemies who are having

405
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:40,403
some sort of religious manipulations, but
that’s not so important.

406
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:44,064
If you can get hold of people who are
drinking,

407
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:46,452
I tell you it will change.

408
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:51,075
And they will now understand that what they
have been doing so far,

409
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:55,635
drinking, running away – now they’ll come
to the fields,

410
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:58,371
and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

411
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:04,144
So you are like very gentle soldiers
of love,

412
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:08,899
and that’s what you have to spread and talk
to others,

413
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,426
give them that joy that you have.

414
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:17,035
Not [to] be satisfied if you have got it
only or [a] few of you have it.

415
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:20,039
You have to spread it very fast, and you
can do it.

416
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,448
Because it doesn’t require money, it
doesn’t require any show,

417
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:28,019
it is just inside it works. It’s already
there,

418
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,935
it’s present there, everybody has it.
I knew all that.

419
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:35,311
Of course, I knew it. But now you also
know it,

420
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:39,226
so you should work it out, and work it out
in a manner

421
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:45,321
that I am sure one day this world will be
a changed place.

422
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,406
Thank you very much.
