1
00:00:01,484 --> 00:00:10,079
Today we are celebrating Sahastrara day.

2
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:20,256
Perhaps we have not realised what a day it must have been.

3
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:30,463
 Without opening the Sahastrara, God Itself was a myth,

4
00:00:30,662 --> 00:00:39,175
 religion itself was a myth, and all talk about Divinity was a myth.

5
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:45,292
 People believed in it but it was just a belief.

6
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:52,539
 And the science, as it was put forward,

7
00:00:52,671 --> 00:01:09,758
was about to obliterate all the value system,
all the proof of God Almighty.

8
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,636
 If you see in the history, one after another,

9
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:23,028
when science established itself,

10
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:30,841
 the people who are so-called in charge of 
the helm of affairs in religion,

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,473
 in different religions tried to cope with the findings of science.

12
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:45,709
They tried to show that:
 “All right, if it is said this much – is in the Bible,

13
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:52,890
and if it is wrong we should correct it.”
Especially Augustine did that.

14
00:01:53,367 --> 00:02:01,960
And it started looking as if it’s all a stupidity this,

15
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:07,521
 these scriptures were just mythical.

16
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:16,509
At least the Koran itself, though, had lots of things which were

17
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:23,334
describing the biology of today.

18
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:32,702
They could not believe that human beings
were specially created by God.

19
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,174
 They thought it was a matter of chance that one after another

20
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:43,635
 the animals acquired a situation by which they became human beings.

21
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:53,903
 Thus all the time Divinity was challenged

22
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,888
and there was no way of giving a proof of whatever

23
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:06,864
is said in the Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita

24
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:14,062
 or in the Upanishadas or in the Torah.

25
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:19,975
 Any one of these things could not be proved

26
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:23,644
because it was still just a faith.

27
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,981
Very, very few people got their Realisation

28
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,800
and when they talked,  people did not believe them

29
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:33,769
 and thought that they are just trying to say something

30
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:40,119
which they are using to propound their own theories.

31
00:03:40,264 --> 00:03:47,101
So the whole thing became a kind of dead science.

32
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:52,564
There was no science of religion.

33
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:57,347
  People started thinking that:
what’s the use of following these ten commandments

34
00:03:57,586 --> 00:04:05,510
or these strict rules of life,
because by following that you gain nothing.

35
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:08,261
 You lose all the fun of the life.

36
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:12,804
 And why think of gaining some punyas also.

37
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:21,580
And that is how all the time there was
a big derailment of human value system.

38
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:29,773
 Also these organised religions, this monolithic organised religions

39
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:37,753
started taking to [a] course of gaining power, or gaining money,

40
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:42,610
because they thought that’s the only way
you can control people and can go on.

41
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:50,127
They were least bothered as to deliver the goods,
 whatever have been described in the Bible.

42
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:57,509
Bible of course was tampered [with] very much
and has been lot of changes in that.

43
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:04,257
And a person like Paul, and Peter, who joined together,

44
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,816
 tried to spoil most of the Truth.

45
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:11,111
Though Koran was not so much touched

46
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,722
but still is dealt with more the right side,

47
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:18,921
with the reproductive system and all those things.

48
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:22,703
And so many things are still ambiguous.

49
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:29,363
Now simultaneously two things have happened,
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not.

50
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:33,990
First thing that has happened is that now we have

51
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:37,913
a new science of microbiology

52
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:46,585
in which we have discovered that every cell has got a DNA tape.

53
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:51,615
Every cell has got a program in it.

54
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:57,406
 As we have in a computer a chip, every cell has got

55
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:04,234
a tape in it, in a way, that it is programmed.

56
00:06:04,512 --> 00:06:08,121
 And according to that program a development takes place.

57
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:11,018
 Now imagine the intricacy of the whole thing!

58
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,973
So many computers are already programmed

59
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:19,682
and all these cells have these in them.

60
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:27,319
So a very mysterious sort of a thing
has come up

61
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:30,731
before the scientists and they cannot explain it.

62
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:36,011
They cannot explain many things but one of them is this.

63
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:39,477
Now what Sahaja Yoga has done is that

64
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:44,062
it has proved that it is the Will of God,

65
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,977
it is the desire of God, the Will of God,

66
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:53,573
which is doing all the work.

67
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,890
 And it has been proved.

68
00:06:56,005 --> 00:07:01,645
All these Chaitanya, Adi Shakti, is nothing but the Will of God.

69
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:05,181
And Will of God is the One

70
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,909
 is working out everything very harmoniously.

71
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,234
 I don’t know if some of you must have read my book,

72
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,190
first book, where I have described how this Earth was created.

73
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,405
 There was a bang, but it was very harmonious,

74
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:28,117
 and how it developed is through the Will of God.

75
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:36,745
 So everything was done in a way that God’s will was working it out.

76
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:42,417
Now the Will of God you are feeling it, on your finger tips.

77
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:48,340
After Realisation, now, you have discovered the the absolute science,

78
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:54,079
 which is the Will of God, which is an absolute science.

79
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:58,362
You people know that we have cured people through Sahaja Yoga.

80
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:02,383
 You also know giving bandhan, and all that, things work out.

81
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,152
So many things work out automatically

82
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:08,738
 after Realisation that people don’t want to believe.

83
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,095
In the beginning people would not believe

84
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,315
when the scientists told them something, but now it is, you can see,

85
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,705
 the science is always in the flux, all the time changing.

86
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,999
One theory is again challenged.

87
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,971
 Another theory’s again challenged.

88
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:30,041
But Sahaja Yoga has exposed you to that Great Truth of science

89
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:35,197
 which cannot be challenged, which is all there.

90
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:41,052
So anybody who comes out with any new proposal

91
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:47,291
about defaming God, or saying that there is no God,

92
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:50,469
 we can prove, not [only] that there is God,

93
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,946
but that everything, the creation of this Earth,

94
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:56,447
 the creation of human beings and everything was done

95
00:08:56,524 --> 00:09:02,158
harmoniously by the Will of God.

96
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,745
 If Will of God has done everything,

97
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,434
the human beings should not take any credit

98
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:11,526
for discovering some things which were created by God.

99
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,168
 Supposing this carpet is made by somebody

100
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,457
and we start discovering all the colours, what is so great?

101
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:20,735
It is all there. You cannot create.

102
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:25,456
So it is not the creation part of it [which is] so much important

103
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,654
 but the fashioning of this world, whole thing
 was done by the Will of God.

104
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:39,567
 Now if the Will of God is so important,  it has to be proved.

105
00:09:40,616 --> 00:09:45,330
 And now through Sahaja Yoga, after the breaking of the Sahastrara,

106
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:51,444
you have now, for the first time, felt the Will of God,

107
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,181
 which is such an important thing,

108
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:57,942
 but for us it is come to us so Sahaj that we don’t understand.

109
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:01,511
 We just give the bandhan and the things work out and

110
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:06,901
we feel that the things have worked out,

111
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:11,386
so it is bandhan which has worked out, and

112
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:18,927
we have managed everything. It’s not so.

113
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,183
It’s much more than that.

114
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:28,951
We have now become part
and parcel of that Big Computer of that Will of God.

115
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:38,372
We have become the medium,
or we can say the channels, of that Will of God.

116
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:46,034
 We are connected with that Will of God
which created all this Universe.

117
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:50,461
So everything we can manage

118
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:55,834
because we have got the Absolute Science in our hand.

119
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:03,653
The Absolute Science which will work out
 the betterment of the whole world.

120
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:09,268
 We can prove it to the scientist that there is a Will of God

121
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,242
 which has done all this creation.

122
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,903
Even evolutionary process is the Will of God.

123
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:21,974
 Without His Will nothing could have happened.

124
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:30,346
So many people used to say that – not even a blade of grass
moves without the Will of God.

125
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:32,774
 Which is a very true thing.

126
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:41,922
And you have seen now that –
the Will of God we have got as our own power.

127
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:47,566
 We can use it. So how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

128
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:52,442
Perhaps we don’t realise how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

129
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:57,551
Sahaja Yoga is not only for saying “Mother, I am full of joy,

130
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:01,299
 I am enjoying myself. I got purified.

131
00:12:01,324 --> 00:12:04,572
 Everything is fine“. But for what?

132
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,219
Why did you get all these blessings?

133
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:13,444
Why you have been cleansed?
So that this knowledge of the Will of God should be apparent in you.

134
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:16,974
Not only that – should be a part and parcel of you.

135
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,317
So we have to raise our level, we have to come up.

136
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:26,484
For mediocre and ordinary people
it is really useless to give them Sahaja Yoga

137
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,647
 because they are good for nothing.

138
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,789
They are not going to help us in any way

139
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:35,900
because what is needed is now, today that,

140
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:41,579
we should have people who can really manifest
and reflect the Will of God.

141
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:45,576
And for that, you can understand, we have to have very strong people

142
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:50,742
 because this Will has created the whole Universe, the Cosmos,

143
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:57,321
this Mother Earth. Everything is created by this Will of God.

144
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:04,465
So now we are exposed to a new dimension

145
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,210
and that dimension is that we are the ones

146
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:13,922
who are channels of that Will of God.

147
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:22,418
So then what is our duty and what should we do about it?

148
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:27,599
As a result of Sahastrara being opened out,

149
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,321
one thing: the illusions have vanished.

150
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,239
What you call [in] Sanskrit is bhranti.

151
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,432
 Illusions have vanished.

152
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:49,299
 You should have no illusion as to the existence of God Almighty,

153
00:13:50,180 --> 00:14:00,433
 the power of his Will and the truth about Sahaja Yoga.

154
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,676
 You should have no doubts at all,
minimum of minimum should be like that.

155
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:12,570
But while using this Power you should be aware

156
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:23,334
that this Power is given to you
because you are capable of handling it.

157
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:27,450
This is the Highest Power you could think of.

158
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:34,699
Take any governor, take any minister,
 anyone, they can be removed tomorrow.

159
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:37,265
They can become corrupt.

160
00:14:37,305 --> 00:14:45,392
They can become absolutely devoid of
 any knowledge of their own powers.

161
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:49,873
 There are many people who just get elected
without knowing what they have to do.

162
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:52,953
So this is not just a conversion of people,

163
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:56,223
it’s not only even transformation,

164
00:14:56,493 --> 00:15:00,994
 but it is a new fashioning of a new human being

165
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:10,277
which has come forward and which is capable
of carrying the Will of God further.

166
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:27,618
So as a result of your Realisation, what you have got?

167
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:35,003
The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone.

168
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:41,175
 You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will

169
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:50,671
and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

170
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:56,980
All His omnipotence has done this work,

171
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,828
and as a collective consciousness  you should also know that

172
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:07,281
 you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

173
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,692
 Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything.

174
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:17,495
 Part of it, that Power, is also within you.

175
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:24,666
So to prove His omnipresence you have to all the time be aware

176
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:29,079
 that you are sahaja yogis. When I find, even now,

177
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,288
 sahaja yogis struggling about their wives, their children,

178
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,762
 their house, their jobs,

179
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,784
 I start wondering what is their level now?

180
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:47,048
 Where are they?
When are they going to take up the role of what they have got?

181
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:52,221
 So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere,

182
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:58,202
 who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out,

183
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,677
 has to work through you people and you have to be

184
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:10,014
 very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people.

185
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:15,198
The more effective you become the more energy you will get.

186
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:20,097
But still I feel that the sahaja yogis are more,

187
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:23,633
 not taking the responsibility of understanding

188
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:27,422
 that they have to represent this God Almighty

189
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:33,574
who is omnipresent, omniscient,

190
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:38,059
who knows everything, who sees everything

191
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:42,767
and who is potent, means Almighty.

192
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,152
If you understand that this is what has happened
after opening the Sahastrara,

193
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:58,063
 that you have now got the power 
which has these three qualities in it.

194
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:05,207
Say now this big thing has to be supported by a strong pillars,

195
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:09,031
but supposing if they are not strong, it will fall down.

196
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,947
In the same way such a Great Power which has come to you.

197
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,628
For that we don’t need very successful people,

198
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:18,476
we don’t need people who have a big name

199
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:20,308
 or those who have lots of money,

200
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:22,613
what we need [is] people of character,

201
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,900
people of understanding,  of wisdom and of strength,

202
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:30,990
that “Whatever may come I will stand by it,

203
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:37,711
I will take to it, I’ll cope with it,
 I’ll change myself and improve myself“.

204
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:57,796
So now illusion has been dispelled.
I hope you all have got rid of your illusions.

205
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:02,359
Also you should have no illusions about yourself.

206
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:06,234
 If you have any illusions you should leave Sahaja Yoga.

207
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:12,612
But know that you are chosen for this purpose by God’s Will,

208
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:17,089
that’s why you are here 
and you have to take it up, the responsibility

209
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:21,890
of understanding of this science which is absolute.

210
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:28,324
 And working it out yourself, for yourself as well as for others.

211
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:32,572
 You have felt My love,

212
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:38,051
but your love must also be felt, because God is love.

213
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,960
So your love must be felt by others.

214
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,857
Other must feel that you are compassionate,
 loving, understanding.

215
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:52,837
That’s all the time this Will of God is flowing through you.

216
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:56,368
 And you have to work it out in such a manner

217
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,335
 that people should know that you are a saint,

218
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,229
 that this power is flowing through you.

219
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,046
Then the second thing that has happened to you

220
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:11,713
is that, not the illusion about God and about yourself,

221
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,879
second thing that has happened –
 that you have understood the integration,

222
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:22,949
that in the world there is complete integration which is existing.

223
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:33,535
Normally if you see the children, 
they have their own natural, innate understanding.

224
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:37,225
They know. If you see, normally, a good child

225
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:40,217
would always like to share his things,

226
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,960
would like to love another child,

227
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,976
  if there’s another little child is there,
  would like to protect that child –

228
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:53,974
 naturally! It won’t think whether it has 
black hair or red hair or blue hair.

229
00:20:55,304 --> 00:21:01,115
 Naturally, innately a child feels that way.

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:07,520
Also if you take another child, supposing, who is a little baby,

231
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:16,024
 they know that one should be careful about the privacy of the body.

232
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,402
Children don’t want to be made nude before others.

233
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:24,472
 No child likes it. Innately they know.

234
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:27,884
So all these innate qualities are within you.

235
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,225
Children don’t like to steal anything.

236
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:33,923
They don’t know what is stealing is. 
They have no idea of stealing.

237
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:42,631
 I’ve also seen also children that,
 if they go to a place which is very beautiful,

238
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:48,615
in somebody’s house, 
they will always try to keep the beauty of that place.

239
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:52,715
 But if it is already shabby they don’t mind.

240
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:57,968
So innately all these qualities are there.

241
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:02,309
 I think the countries which are supposed to be 
underdeveloped have so many of these

242
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:07,696
 qualities within them, which are innately built within us.

243
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:10,283
 Innocence is innately built.

244
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:13,458
 So the Will of God built up,

245
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,614
first and foremost thing, was innocence, the auspiciousness.

246
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:22,434
 The first thing He did was to create Shri Ganesha,

247
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:26,942
or I would say, She, because the Will of God is Adi Shakti.

248
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:33,827
And all this was created first of all to make
 the whole world very beautiful.

249
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:38,845
 All these innate qualities were also placed within you.

250
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:41,658
All those Deities were placed within you.

251
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:47,313
 [They] were specially made, human beings,

252
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,032
 that they should become saintly people,

253
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:55,199
that they should have their saintly, innate sense.

254
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:58,260
 But it happened in the countries which developed,

255
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:05,093
that our brain was bombarded 
by all kinds of television, all kind of things,

256
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:13,549
and we became very, we can say, we became very vulnerable.

257
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:19,489
We started getting into the ideas of others.

258
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,804
Anybody who is dominating could dominate us.

259
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:26,097
 It’s not only Hitler who dominated people.

260
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:32,514
We also see today how much we are dominated, 
if you really detach yourself from this world.

261
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,374
For example fashions. 
Certain things that come up, people cannot give up at any cost.

262
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:46,858
They cannot take to something that is sensible 
because it’s a fashion.

263
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:52,514
For example nowadays there’s a fashion, 
say to have such a small skirt.

264
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:55,363
 You can’t get a long skirt anywhere.

265
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:59,109
Everybody has to wear that kind of a skirt

266
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:03,811
otherwise you are not ‘in’,  you are not in the madhouse!

267
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,589
Now this kind of thing is bombarded on us morning till evening

268
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:15,548
so, first of all, we become slaves of these entrepreneurs.

269
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:20,514
Whatever they give us now, I was told that in Belgium
 you cannot get anything fresh.

270
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:25,765
You have to take everything from the supermarket, 
which is all tinned.

271
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:31,803
Gradually what is happening to us – 
we are getting absolutely artificial.

272
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,715
The food is artificial, the dress is artificial,

273
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,501
our whole attitude becomes artificial

274
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,150
because we are so much bombarded by advertisement,

275
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:45,746
by all kinds of outside influences

276
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,597
that we just get lost

277
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,759
 and we forget what is our innate sense

278
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:55,224
which is being dominated by all these modern things.

279
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:59,564
 So adding up to the science also

280
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:06,204
 there is  a big progress in another direction,  that we can call,

281
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:10,016
 the money became very important.

282
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,414
Once money becomes important,

283
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,605
 then all your entrepreneurs become important,

284
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:19,868
because they know how to make money and befool you all the time.

285
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,342
 Today you have this thing, tomorrow you have that thing.

286
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,858
 Today you change this and have this thing.

287
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:30,168
But those people who are innately built, they do not change!

288
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:35,590
 They have their dresses of the same type, they do not change.

289
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:39,982
 On the contrary they find it very difficult to get out of

290
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:44,334
 their traditional achievements and they don’t want to change themselves.

291
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:47,869
So for sahaja yogis it is important to see and watch

292
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:53,744
if they are getting this slavery from
 the entrepreneurs in modern times.

293
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:01,487
Then, the thoughts. 
So many books we read, which gives you thoughts,

294
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:09,527
 which are some mad rambling,
 I would say, of some madman, like Freud.

295
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:13,167
How could Freud influence the West?

296
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:20,307
 Because you have lost your innate sense and you accepted.

297
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,884
You accepted that and that’s how Freud became your, 
sort of a, Jesus Christ.

298
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:31,917
He became the most important thing.

299
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:39,577
Sex became the most important thing. I mean it’s so simple.

300
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:42,588
With little common sense you can understand

301
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:50,032
 that, at every moment, we are put into this kind of a

302
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:02,632
 of a domination by these few

303
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:07,109
domineering people who have certain ideas, 
and they put forward.

304
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:12,468
 Anybody puts any idea. For example, 
Sade (the Marquis de Sade) or Sartre or anyone.

305
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,654
 That idea starts becoming “Oh he said it“.
 Who is he?

306
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:21,054
What is his life? 
Just see for yourself what sort of a man he is.

307
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:25,300
With little common sense. 
But with your will that you have now,

308
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:29,697
 Will of God, which has fashioned the whole world, 
which has fashioned you.

309
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:34,834
Every cell within you has been fashioned by God Almighty

310
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:40,003
 and what you are doing is to play
 into the hands of these entrepreneurs.

311
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:47,321
 They have realised that these vulnerable people are very good for

312
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:57,814
having as their disciples,  I should say,
 to make money, to befool them.

313
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:03,977
Now on this side, you have such a Great Power,

314
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,035
 you are chosen for a, such a great thing,

315
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:14,128
and on the other side you have this kind of slavery.

316
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,734
So try to understand that your innate qualities were lost.

317
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:26,776
But luckily, by the Kundalini awakening 
and by the breaking of the Sahastrara,

318
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:31,004
 all these innate qualities which looked like lost:

319
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:34,589
like your innocence, like your creativity,

320
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:42,111
like your religion within, like your compassion

321
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:52,823
and love for the humanity ,
 like your power of judgment, wisdom.

322
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:57,676
 All these great qualities which we thought were lost were nothing

323
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,295
 but they were in a dormant state.

324
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:04,374
They all got awakened one by one.

325
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,264
I don’t have to tell you “Don’t drink this!

326
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:10,279
 Don’t eat this! Don’t do that!”.

327
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:14,617
You yourself realise that this is wrong.

328
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,327
You yourself know what is good for you.

329
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,827
 And still if you want to do wrong you can go ahead.

330
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:26,549
But already there is a light within you to see for yourself

331
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,613
what is good and what is bad.

332
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:33,111
It has come because of this Sahastrara being opened out

333
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:36,150
to this – a new dimension of new knowledge.

334
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:39,684
 And this is not new, it is all innately built within you.

335
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:45,606
Now all those innate qualities are manifesting 
and you are enjoying them.

336
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:52,242
So now you have to get out of your petty ideas and petty things.

337
00:29:52,966 --> 00:29:55,608
People are reporting to Me something very funny –

338
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,898
I can’t believe sahaja yogis can do like that –

339
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,982
that they run away with the plates that I have bought,

340
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,683
or they run away with the cups, they throw things here and there,

341
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:07,091
 all over the places they are throwing things.

342
00:30:07,163 --> 00:30:09,678
How can you behave like this?

343
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,220
 I mean this is so stupid and so insipid.

344
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:18,540
 If you do not have a proper discipline of life yourself,

345
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:22,274
you cannot carry the Will of God, you cannot.

346
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:27,008
But I’m not going to tell you “Do this or do that!”

347
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:30,009
 I respect your freedom

348
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:37,096
and I just want that your own Kundalini should awaken 
that wisdom in you,

349
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:40,372
 that greatness in you, that glory in you

350
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:44,859
and you start understanding what is our innate quality.

351
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,097
So it will purify you.

352
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,660
Once you are purified completely, like

353
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,484
you see, if you have some gold which is not pure

354
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:58,451
you put it in the fire,  the gold is separated.

355
00:30:58,476 --> 00:31:03,340
In the same way, the fire of Kundalini cleanses you completely,

356
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:05,818
 makes you absolutely clean,

357
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:13,483
and you start seeing your own glory, 
your own nature, your own greatness.

358
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:19,497
 So the integration part comes to you easily.
You start integrating.

359
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:27,995
 First of all, we used to have sahaja yogis, say from,

360
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:32,538
some from England, some from Spain, some from here.

361
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:36,435
 They would always have different groups,
 they would never sit together.

362
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,149
 You could make out this is English sitting here,

363
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:44,095
they are sitting here, they are sitting here, 
and they would form a group.

364
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:51,261
But now it’s not so. Now I find they all are becoming integrated.

365
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:59,487
 The integration of human beings is 
the most important thing for Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:06,100
That comes by understanding, not by your intelligence,

367
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:12,384
but by innate understanding that – 
all human beings are made by God,

368
00:32:12,487 --> 00:32:18,153
by His will, and we have no right to despise anyone.

369
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:25,120
The second integration that has come within you is that all religions,

370
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:32,716
 all religions, are born on the same tree of spiritual life.

371
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:40,552
That all religions are to be worshipped, all incarnations,

372
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:47,864
all prophets, all scriptures are to be worshipped.

373
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:53,998
 There are defects, there are problems with
 those scriptures which can be corrected.

374
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,040
So gradually you start entering into the subtler side of Divinity,

375
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:04,457
to understand that all these people have worked hard

376
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:07,652
to create, today, the atmosphere for Sahaja Yoga,

377
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,940
 and no religion is to be despised,  
and no religion is to be attacked,

378
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:19,880
 which is a very, very, absolutely a unreal thing

379
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:26,102
and you are working out a very unreal theory

380
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:30,166
 which doesn’t exist in the Divine plan.

381
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:34,122
So this is how we finish all fundamentalism.

382
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,448
 Fundamentalists are the ones who believed that

383
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:40,558
this is written in this book, this is written in this book,

384
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:45,110
and that we, because we read this book, we are something better.

385
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:48,484
Anybody can read any book, what is so great?

386
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,959
Same, I would say, in Sahaja Yoga people 
should not become fundamentalist.

387
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:54,546
 Be very careful!

388
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:57,437
Because that’s what you are – born like that, I mean,

389
00:33:57,565 --> 00:34:00,080
 I don’t know, it’s not your innate quality  but

390
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,076
the way you are made that way, 
you have fashioned yourself that way,

391
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:08,725
that you start also making Sahaja Yoga sometimes a fundamental.

392
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:10,717
 “Mother said so.”

393
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,399
Do not use Me anywhere!

394
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:17,622
 “Mother said so!” Is a way you want to dominate others.

395
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:24,243
You yourself say because now you have a right, 
you have an individuality in Sahaja Yoga.

396
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:27,421
You can say what you have to say yourself,

397
00:34:27,604 --> 00:34:30,650
but don’t say that “Mother has said it!”

398
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:34,413
Because anybody can start it, like that: “Christ said it!”.

399
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:40,243
A clergyman or, a say, pope can stand up on his

400
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:45,646
own platform  and say that Christ has said it.

401
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,684
They can just arbitrarily use all these things.

402
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:55,021
So nobody has business to use Me arbitrarily.

403
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,703
Whatever you have to say you say yourself.

404
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:01,418
But don’t ever quote Me as that: “Mother has said it,”

405
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:05,841
or, “In this book such and such is written,
 so this is the line, that is important.

406
00:35:05,941 --> 00:35:10,370
” You are not bound by any line, by whatever I say.

407
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:15,778
It is you who has to stand up and see for yourself 
what you have to say,

408
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:19,327
 because you have to use now your will

409
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:28,824
and for that you have to develop yourself to have Pure Will,
 the Pure Desire of God Almighty.

410
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:33,824
The integration not only outward, but inward.

411
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:40,097
Like first of all, whatever we did, our mind used to say one thing,

412
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,032
our heart used to say another thing, 
our brain used to say another thing.

413
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:51,429
Now what has happened that all these 3 things have become one.

414
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:58,437
So, whatever your brain says is absolutely acceptable to your heart,

415
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:01,540
absolutely acceptable to your attention.

416
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:05,552
So you yourself, you have become now integrated.

417
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:09,211
Many people write “Mother I want to do it, but I can’t do it,”

418
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:13,483
 “Mother it was my desire to do it, but I can’t do it.” Not now.

419
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:20,474
Now you are completely integrated 
and you can easily do the whole thing very well.

420
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:29,246
If you want to examine yourself, 
you should try to find out “Am I integrated or not?

421
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:32,888
Whatever I’m doing, am I doing with my full heart or not,

422
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,197
 with my full attention or not?”

423
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:40,530
I’ve seen that you do with full heart and full intelligence

424
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:43,244
but full attention is not there.

425
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:48,753
Still the attention, which is the first thing 
that was enlightened, is not fully used.

426
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:57,009
So the whole attention should be absolutely there,

427
00:36:57,231 --> 00:37:01,794
 that, “I have to do this thing with full attention.”

428
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:06,972
Otherwise, the integration is not complete, integration is partial.

429
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:12,697
So these three things have to be completely integrated.

430
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:25,116
 So the integration of all the chakras comes in.

431
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:28,592
Like whatever you do, has to be auspicious.

432
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:33,497
Whatever you do has to be with full attention.

433
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:38,768
Whatever you do has to be absolutely religious.

434
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:45,383
So like that, all these centres are being absolutely,

435
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:50,804
 one integrated power that you have.

436
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,296
So the whole life should be integrated.

437
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:56,219
Now, say somebody’s husband is not that level

438
00:37:56,267 --> 00:38:00,655
or somebody’s wife is not of that level,  you shouldn’t bother.

439
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:06,501
 You should just bother about yourself. 
Don’t expect anything from anybody else.

440
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:11,537
 It is your duty which is important. 
You have to fulfill your duty

441
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,615
and you have to work it out yourself.

442
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:20,522
Unless and until you understand that it is your individual being

443
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:25,805
 which has achieved it, 
and it’s the individual being which has to realise it,

444
00:38:25,932 --> 00:38:31,622
 is the individual being that has to become one,
 integrated with the rest of them.

445
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:35,380
 If you start putting things, like many a times I’ve seen

446
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,379
 [that] if I say something people start thinking

447
00:38:38,427 --> 00:38:42,527
that I am saying for somebody else, they never take it for themselves.

448
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:49,587
So,not we have to see what is my gain: “I’ve got financial gain" say

449
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:55,288
 “I’ve got physical gains, 
I’ve got mental gains, I’ve got joy, happiness”

450
00:38:55,313 --> 00:38:58,639
 that’s not the only thing.

451
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:03,575
That should not be the only criteria.

452
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:08,982
But what you should have is the understanding

453
00:39:09,578 --> 00:39:16,334
of your own personality which is being specially fashioned

454
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:23,716
 [through] many, many lives for you 
to come in this life to get your Realisation,

455
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:29,809
to do the further work of Will of God.

456
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:38,228
Every moment when you see a miracle taking place, you do realise

457
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,652
 that it’s all done by Paramchaitanya.

458
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:44,851
But what is Paramchaitanya – is the will of Adi Shakti.

459
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:48,422
And what is Adi Shakti – is the Will of God.

460
00:39:49,815 --> 00:39:57,343
So, is all, whatever is done, is all ‘fixed entities’, 
we can call them,

461
00:39:57,536 --> 00:40:05,261
or these vibrations are like, we can say, DNA tapes.

462
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:10,309
They all know how they have to fashion you.

463
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:13,834
See, today it’s very sunny.

464
00:40:13,874 --> 00:40:17,231
Everybody is surprised how can they have.

465
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:19,878
 So many things happen like this.

466
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:23,108
The other day, we had havan, it was absolutely sunny.

467
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,969
So the whole Cosmos is working for you.

468
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:29,523
 You are on the stage now and you have to see to it,

469
00:40:29,611 --> 00:40:33,015
 but if you don’t have faith in yourself,

470
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:40,295
if you are not confident as to what you are, how can you help?

471
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:48,954
How can you work out yourself 
and work out all the problems of the world,

472
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,586
which are created only by human beings?

473
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:59,029
So we have to absolutely overthrow all these dominations on us.

474
00:40:59,346 --> 00:41:03,661
 First from science. We can prove everything that Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:07,301
whatever it has said about science, has been proved.

476
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:12,608
So, we can throw science which is just always,

477
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:15,625
all the time, in the flux, it’s changing all the time.

478
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:18,391
Then the so-called religions that we have.

479
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:23,362
So-called religions because people who have been Catholics,

480
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:28,082
who have been Protestants, who have been Hindus 
or Muslims, or this and that,

481
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:31,526
they all have got that thing on their heads.

482
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:34,066
And this has to be thrown away.

483
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,332
 We have to become a new personality.

484
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:43,031
After Realisation, as I said, 
you become like a lotuses is from the mud.

485
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,100
So now you have become lotuses and the lotuses

486
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,354
have to throw away all this dead mud,

487
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:53,349
 otherwise fragrance won’t be there.

488
00:41:53,629 --> 00:41:55,414
 That, one has to achieve:

489
00:41:55,525 --> 00:42:01,727
 is to throw away all these shackles 
which are, which are killing you,

490
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:14,692
 which are of no use, but a burden.

491
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:18,287
And beautiful lotuses as you are

492
00:42:18,442 --> 00:42:24,095
you have to understand that 
the whole fashioning has been done so carefully,

493
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:30,271
with such sweetness, with such delicacy.

494
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:36,008
So first of all we must have respect for ourselves,

495
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:40,415
we must have affection and love for others

496
00:42:41,304 --> 00:42:46,804
and we must have respect, means we must have discipline.

497
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:49,812
We have to have the discipline

498
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:54,811
because if you respect yourself you’ll definitely discipline yourself

499
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:56,883
 and you’ll make it available.

500
00:42:58,362 --> 00:43:04,806
Now as you can realise, that from My life itself,

501
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:10,715
that I work very hard, travel a lot, 
much more than any one of you can do.

502
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:19,028
Because I have the will that – I have to bring this world

503
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,732
 to that state of enjoyment, to that state of happiness,

504
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:29,132
to that state of Divinity, where they realise

505
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:35,083
 what is their glory, what is the glory of their Father.

506
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:39,756
So I work very hard and I never even think

507
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,135
that something will go wrong with Me,

508
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:44,659
or “This will happen”,  “What will happen?”

509
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:47,662
 I never have bothered you about My family life,

510
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:50,395
about My children, about anyone.

511
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:54,196
Whatever problems I had, I am dealing with them Myself.

512
00:43:54,403 --> 00:43:57,664
But here I get such big, big letters from sahaja yogis,

513
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:02,779
writing about their daughter, their son, this thing, that thing.

514
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:07,870
 Another thing is attachment to family is
 the biggest burden on your heads

515
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:11,886
 and all the time you are worried about your children,

516
00:44:11,911 --> 00:44:14,606
you are worried about this, you are worried about that.

517
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:16,684
That’s not your responsibility.

518
00:44:18,237 --> 00:44:19,792
Please try to understand.

519
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:23,419
That’s the responsibility of God Almighty.

520
00:44:23,924 --> 00:44:26,850
You can’t do better than Him can you?

521
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:31,373
But when you try to take the responsibility 
He says “All right, look after!”

522
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:33,547
 and the problems start.

523
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:40,346
‘Detachment’ is the word one should understand in a proper sense.

524
00:44:40,957 --> 00:44:43,605
 When I ask people why do you throw things here and there, say

525
00:44:43,629 --> 00:44:45,930
 “We are detached!”- wonderful way!

526
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:50,451
 And what about your children? You cling on to them.

527
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:53,883
What about your own things? You cling on to them.

528
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:56,976
For a small little thing, they’ll bother My head.

529
00:44:57,389 --> 00:45:01,923
And, when it belongs to Me or to Sahaja Yoga,

530
00:45:02,018 --> 00:45:05,173
 then they’ll have a very nice time with it –

531
00:45:05,278 --> 00:45:07,493
and throw it away,  wherever they feel like.

532
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:10,140
 I mean this kind of irresponsibility!

533
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:13,373
How can you call them divine?

534
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:16,021
 How can they be saintly people?

535
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:21,678
Saintly people not only are responsible for themselves,
 but for everyone.

536
00:45:23,163 --> 00:45:29,532
Very slowly, smoothly, sweetly, with great affection,

537
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:32,133
 I have brought you to this level.

538
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:35,903
 I didn’t ask you to go to Himalayas or stand on your heads

539
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:39,846
 or to donate all your properties to Me.
 Nothing of the kind.

540
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:45,591
 We have managed it in a very, very beautiful manner.

541
00:45:46,012 --> 00:45:48,712
Now further, when you have to go further,

542
00:45:49,674 --> 00:45:53,457
then you have to understand that your duties

543
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:56,594
are to be fulfilled by you and by nobody else.

544
00:45:57,056 --> 00:46:02,045
But these duties are done by you,

545
00:46:02,102 --> 00:46:08,321
are towards your family, towards your house, 
towards this, towards that.

546
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,487
 No duties towards Sahaja Yoga.

547
00:46:16,098 --> 00:46:21,099
So when you were, before Sahaja Yoga, 
you were not attached to anyone,

548
00:46:21,273 --> 00:46:24,724
 in the sense – you were only attached to yourself, self-centered.

549
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:27,470
Now you have widened yourself a little more,

550
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:30,633
 that now you are attached to your wife, to your children.

551
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,459
 But that’s just the same.

552
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:39,503
That is also selfish, because they are your children, you think.

553
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:44,551
They are not your children, they are the children of God.

554
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:49,026
I hope all of you are intelligent enough to understand

555
00:46:49,424 --> 00:46:53,891
your responsibility and work it out.

556
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,711
 This is a very important thing that has happened to you

557
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:00,998
 that Sahastrara has opened.

558
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:04,674
 Now you can prove the existence of God,

559
00:47:04,714 --> 00:47:08,428
His Will, everything, to the whole world.

560
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:11,715
 Nobody can challenge Sahaja Yoga.

561
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:15,630
Those scientist who will challenge can be told.

562
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:20,644
 Anybody, whether you’re a scientist, economist, politician, anything,

563
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:26,216
everything can be explained in the light of Sahaja Yoga

564
00:47:26,328 --> 00:47:30,616
 and can be proved that there’s only one politics –that is of God,

565
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:33,305
 one economics – that is of God,

566
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:39,441
 and there is only one religion – 
that is of God,  is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

567
00:47:40,188 --> 00:47:41,957
 It can be proved,

568
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:47,276
there’s nothing to be afraid of or to worry about.

569
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:50,541
This all can be proved to the scientist and

570
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:56,040
 to the other intellectuals and to some few people

571
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:57,587
if they want to listen to us.

572
00:47:57,612 --> 00:48:00,120
 If they don’t want to listen to us, forget it.

573
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:02,852
Because we are so powerful, why should you worry about them?

574
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,903
But, if they are willing to listen to us,

575
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:10,495
 then is better that we tell them  
“Now we have discovered this Great Power”,

576
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:13,172
 and if it works out,

577
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,910
 if this Great Power works out

578
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:20,791
 then only we can really fashion the whole world in a new way.

579
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:24,495
I have great hopes from you people,

580
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:27,617
 but the seriousness with which you should take Sahaja Yoga,

581
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:31,632
for example even meditation, people don’t do.

582
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:36,724
 Simple thing like meditation,
you people don’t do,  I can’t understand.

583
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:39,200
How will you grow without meditation?

584
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:45,361
 Unless and until you become thoughtlessly aware you cannot grow.

585
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:50,627
 So you have to, you have to at least meditate morning, evening.

586
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:54,761
There are many people who are not even collective by temperament.

587
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,869
 If they are staying in an ashram 
they just think that ashram life is no good.

588
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,750
 Such people should really get out of Sahaja Yoga,

589
00:49:02,558 --> 00:49:05,739
 because they have not yet understood what this Sahaja Yoga is.

590
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,390
Without collectivity how will you grow?

591
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:11,118
How will you assemble your power? You see?

592
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:15,685
You know very well that in a sangha, in a group,

593
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,391
 in combining together only, you can be strong.

594
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:24,301
 Is a fact that if you have one stick you can break it,

595
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:28,023
 but if you put many sticks together you cannot break it.

596
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:32,966
But there are still people 
I know who are still not so much in collectivity.

597
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:37,882
 Shows how poor they are in their understanding of their own Self,

598
00:49:38,054 --> 00:49:39,811
 and they are telling Me that “Mother,

599
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:44,049
we don’t want to stay in the Ashram  now anywhere more.”

600
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:46,678
So they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

601
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,203
Without the collectivity, you cannot grow.

602
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:53,568
Without the discipline of Sahaja Yoga, you cannot grow.

603
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:59,008
 It’s better to have ten people of good quality
 than to have thousand useless people.

604
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,772
That’s what is the Will of God.

605
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:05,938
 So now, as you are today here,  so many people,

606
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:09,510
 I am really enamoured  to see so many people are there.

607
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:14,495
And we have done so much of our growth

608
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,222
and grown out of all those 
nonsensical things that we were following.

609
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:24,361
But today we have to take a vow

610
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:31,051
that –  “I’ll now fashion my life according to the Will of God.

611
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:34,216
 Absolutely. And dedicate myself to that.”

612
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:38,265
No family, no other considerations.

613
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:41,305
Just forget it! Nothing so important.

614
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,732
Everything can be looked after by Will of God.

615
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:48,415
So if you just try to follow the Will of God,

616
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:50,795
 your children will be looked after,

617
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:55,303
 everything will be looked after,
you don’t have to worry for anything.

618
00:50:55,759 --> 00:50:57,203
 And that works.

619
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,679
Just try to understand that you have problems

620
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:03,666
 because you don’t want to give those problems to God,

621
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:06,503
you want to keep it to themselves, that’s why you have problems.

622
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,630
If you decide that “No,

623
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:14,613
 I just want to give these problems to the God’s will,” Finished!

624
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:20,382
Also there are some who want to say that “We are not so capable

625
00:51:20,462 --> 00:51:25,771
 Mother, we can’t do it.” 
Saying like this also is stupid.

626
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:31,284
You test yourself, you see for yourself.

627
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:36,197
So first of all, one has to understand why do we say such a thing?

628
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,936
 Maybe that we are very money-oriented,

629
00:51:40,148 --> 00:51:44,263
that we want to have money to ourselves, or something like that.

630
00:51:44,474 --> 00:51:48,672
Or some people are there who talk of business also in Sahaja Yoga.

631
00:51:48,946 --> 00:51:52,353
 There must be something like a money orientation,

632
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:54,953
or some sort of a material attachment

633
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:59,008
that they say that ‘We are not capable,
 we cannot change.”

634
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:03,189
The second could be this mamatwa as they call it.

635
00:52:03,237 --> 00:52:08,186
The attachment to your family, children, this, that.

636
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:11,273
Or, ‘This is mine, this is mine,this is mine.”

637
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:13,989
 This could be the second reason

638
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:18,033
 that you think that you are not bold enough

639
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:22,567
or you are not strong enough to do Sahaja Yoga.

640
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:28,796
Thirdly could be that you are still playing with your old habits

641
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:34,248
and that you are enjoying your life without virtues.

642
00:52:35,174 --> 00:52:37,339
There can be some reason like that.

643
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:41,251
So just try to locate, “Why am I behaving like this?

644
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:46,380
 Why am I not getting into the same

645
00:52:46,476 --> 00:52:53,225
beautiful path of my ascent as everybody has got it.”

646
00:52:53,868 --> 00:52:58,483
 If we introspect, you’ll find out that 
"There’s something wrong with me

647
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,871
 that I think I am not capable of doing.”

648
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:05,125
You are capable of doing everything!

649
00:53:05,578 --> 00:53:08,995
You just try this and enjoy it.

650
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:18,290
 So, most important thing now [that] 
remains is that you should become a

651
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:24,245
proper, strong, compassionate vehicle of God’s Will.

652
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,658
So. Then, what is most important of course,

653
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:32,904
 I agree, that you do My puja, 
because that helps you a lot, no doubt.

654
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:35,837
 But other things are not important.

655
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:42,488
So many other things you people tell Me is not of importance.

656
00:53:43,574 --> 00:53:48,803
Main thing is that you should all ascend higher and higher

657
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:55,266
and compete with each other in getting into higher situation.

658
00:53:55,845 --> 00:54:01,624
As it is, I think in such a short time 
we have achieved a lot, no doubt,

659
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:05,526
but still we have to speed up and work it out.

660
00:54:05,736 --> 00:54:11,070
I am sure that this new science, 
or we can say, the, which is the

661
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:15,457
absolute science will one day outshadow

662
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:19,184
the other science, and tell people that: this is what it is.

663
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:22,082
 It is in your hands, you work it out.

664
00:54:22,914 --> 00:54:27,046
So today is the day we are celebrate by which

665
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:31,839
we have opened absolutely a new dimension,

666
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:41,334
absolutely a venue of great Divinity,

667
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:44,975
of the proofs of Divine.

668
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:54,450
And this is something so great that we can really finish

669
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:59,802
 all the illusions they have about themselves, about their ego.

670
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,772
We can manage them.

671
00:55:01,852 --> 00:55:04,971
 That power you all have.

672
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:11,230
May God Bless You.
