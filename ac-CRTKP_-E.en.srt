1
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,170
I’m sorry for being late.

2
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:49,000
I did not know that this programme is in a beautiful place like this.

3
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:04,120
And here you see a beautiful painting of Michelangelo

4
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:16,100
expressing the desire of the Divine, your Father, to save you,

5
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,150
to help you out, and is working out.

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:49,130
In Germany we have had very great aggressive happenings

7
00:01:51,070 --> 00:02:06,180
and that brought forth a devastating effect on the Western life, all over.

8
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,000
The value systems were broken,

9
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,000
the idea of dharma was disturbed,

10
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,100
women started bahaving like men

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and so many people died.

12
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,100
Very young people died, very very young.

13
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,100
All their desires were not fulfilled,

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:52,150
all their life gave them nothing but war.

15
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,170
That was a kind of a heatwave that came,

16
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,120
destroying all the subtler things.

17
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,130
When the nature gets its respite, or is angry,

18
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,000
it destroys only gross things

19
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,200
but when human beings start destroying

20
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,070
they destroy even the subtler things like their value system,

21
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,220
your character, your chastity, your innocence, your forbearance.

22
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,200
So now the war is on on the subtler level.

23
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,090
We have to now understand

24
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,150
that all these things have brought such a shattering effect in the West,

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,180
on the Western personality.

26
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:18,180
So the first effort one has to do is to repair it,

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,110
to put it straight, make it stand on its own legs.

28
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:37,030
Because people lost their personality, their tradition,

29
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,130
they had no moorings, no roots

30
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,100
and they started moving towards anything

31
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,240
that was brought in as some sort of a intellectual experience.

32
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,120
The women became very independent

33
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:12,220
and they thought they can work out their own problems.

34
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,170
That they thought they can become like men.

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here the problem started even in a worse way.

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,050
Because woman is a woman

37
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,020
and a very little thing which is, call it, a man in her

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,100
and when she tries to avoid what she has

39
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,000
and develop something that she has very little

40
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,120
then she becomes funny.

41
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,000
But she may be possessed by so many men who are dead,

42
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:10,030
her desire to become manly can attract so many bhoots

43
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,000
who want to enter into a woman’s mind.

44
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,150
And when they enter they have the garb of a woman

45
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,030
and mind of a devil.

46
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,240
And the women can not see it

47
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,170
because maybe with those devilish things

48
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,020
in the wordly way they might be successful.

49
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,120
They might be better off. Maybe they can dominate everyone,

50
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,220
they might become meticulous like men, absolutely matter of fact,

51
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:04,120
very neat, tidy, clean, devoid of all beauty and sweetness.

52
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:20,170
Then these women ultimately become like vampires

53
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,080
so though the war is over

54
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,100
it is working through the women of Germany, I think.

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,170
I’d heard this attack had come before also

56
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,240
and there were women called as Amazonic.

57
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,050
Now that history is repeating itself again.

58
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,080
The other day I had an interview with a German lady

59
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,100
and I was amazed at her attitude

60
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
because I felt she’s still a Nazi in her, some Nazi bhoot is sitting in her.

61
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,220
She was a double personality, one way she was talking sweetly,

62
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,000
another way she was a Nazi

63
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and a fascist.

64
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:29,170
And very cunningly they have got arguments.

65
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,170
The first thing they can do is to say

66
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,030
that we are siding with downtrodden people, like India.

67
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,230
Indians are Aryans, we are Aryans

68
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:54,170
and we are people who are sympathising with Aryans.

69
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,100
Indians are spiritual people

70
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,150
and they feel they are like Indians of all the things, you know, can you believe it?

71
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,100
The quality of life should improve, is the point.

72
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,200
The quality of men is different from that of women,

73
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,020
I have told you many a times.

74
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,170
And if women try to be manly

75
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,180
then they cannot achieve anything proper.

76
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,000
We have had many like this.

77
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,000
You have seen Mao`s wife.

78
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,000
You have seen Mrs  Chanka Sheik.

79
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,200
Now this new lady Carlos,

80
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,130
Carlos her name is? Marcos, Marcos.

81
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,200
So many women like this.

82
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,030
They always make a mess of things when they try to be manly.

83
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
In the history we have many women.

84
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,150
In India women are very well equipped.

85
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,030
we have had women like Jhansi ki Rani

86
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,070
who fought against the British. She was a widow.

87
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,180
She tied her child on her back and fought the British.

88
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,080
They say that her horse jumped from 180ft

89
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,000
from the turret of a fort

90
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,230
and the Britishers have written down that

91
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,100
‘Though we have got Jhansi the victory comes to us

92
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,170
but glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani’.

93
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,180
We have had great women in India.

94
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,230
Like Nur Jahan was another great woman,

95
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,000
we had Chanbebi, Ahalyabai

96
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,000
but they were all women, they didn’t have ego of men.

97
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:08,200
When it comes to one can work, work in the offices with men

98
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,180
but they need not become men.

99
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,230
I’ll tell you an example of my own.

100
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,120
I had to build our house in Lucknow.

101
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,100
I did it in real woman style

102
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
and I built a very good house,

103
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,240
better than any man could  build in a very very cheap way.

104
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,000
Like a man would go, first of all he’ll get an architect,

105
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,000
go and measure everything,

106
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
then he’ll try to fit everything into it beforehand.

107
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,080
Then he will in his ego go to some expensive place shop

108
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,000
get something expensive, be cheated by that.

109
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,050
Then again in his ego he’ll go and get some very expensive labour

110
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,100
and appoint somebody, he’ll be in charge of everything, in charge.

111
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,050
I did it in a very different way.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I had money, so went and found out

113
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,060
who have the best people, who have the best bricks.

114
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,000
The house was to be built by bricks.

115
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,230
Then what else do you need?

116
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,200
Just like a woman would cook her food, you see.

117
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,200
You need also sand, all right.

118
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,230
Then you need cement and you need iron bars, and labour.

119
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,000
So I didn’t go the way men went round.

120
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:06,240
I found out the man who was selling the best bricks.

121
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,130
So he said: “I have no money because I have to put up those  kiln

122
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,060
and fill them up with the bricks

123
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,200
and for that you require initial money.

124
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,120
I said: “Alright, I’ll buy one whole kiln from you, whole one.

125
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,020
How much will you take from me?”

126
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,030
He said: “Five thousand rupees sufficient.”

127
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,150
But if he said, “If the kiln goes off,

128
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,080
or there’s something wrong with it, if it misfired,

129
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,150
then it is your lookout. I said: “Doesn’t matter.

130
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,150
You put one kiln in my name.”

131
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
So I bought a complete kiln from him, complete.

132
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,070
kiln is a thing where they put all the bricks, you see,

133
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,070
and then cover it with mud and fire it from down.

134
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,200
Sometimes it could be that the whole thing can go into a waste

135
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
or crumple down

136
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,140
I said: "You do like that. Only 5.000."

137
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,020
When it is nicely fired and all that

138
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,050
it would cost you nothing short of 50,000 rupees.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,010
Then I went to the river and I said:

140
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:31,000
“How much for a one part?” – as they call it, a big area of sand.

141
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,130
They said: “At this time, when it is summertime, it is very little,

142
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,240
but in wintertime it will be quite a lot.”

143
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,220
A man would go, he’d say “Alright, now you need so much, bring it now.

144
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,100
Then you will need more, you bring it now.”

145
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,070
But I didn’t do that, I said “Summertime is a nice thing,

146
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,150
cheap you are getting, why not buy the whole?”

147
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,240
So I bought the whole part, the whole area of that sand.

148
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,130
All right. Then I went for the ironmongers.

149
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,170
I said: "Now what about iron?"

150
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,100
They said: “You have to order

151
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,240
but if you order in bulk then we’ll give you much cheaper.

152
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,020
And cash down you have to pay so much.” I said “Alright.”

153
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:24,030
I ordered it. So it was all ready, just like we do for cooking,

154
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,000
you get everything ready made, ready there.

155
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,130
Then what we needed was wood.

156
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,120
So they said “Wood will come from Nepal.”

157
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,120
I said “Alright. What else?”

158
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,200
They said: “From any other forest it can come.”

159
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,180
So I went to a forest in the centre of India called Jabal

160
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
and there I ordered.

161
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,100
The whole wood was cut, newly cut.

162
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,070
and in an auction I bought a lot of wood from there.

163
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,000
And I got all that there, plus I got the marble from there.

164
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,120
This marble was never used before, anywhere.

165
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,080
I said: “It’s very simple, I can use this marble for everything.”

166
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,200
So I got marble and wood together from that place.

167
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,150
Then the labour. Then I asked my friends

168
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:30,180
if they knew any good workers who are good at masonary work.

169
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,120
They said: “Yes, this one is good, that one is good”

170
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,150
so I call all of them. I said, “See now you can stay with me in this house

171
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,000
and I’ll feed you very well and I’ll give you food

172
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,100
and I’ll look after you very well.”

173
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,120
So they all settled down with their family

174
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and I used to cook for them.

175
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,230
By cooking I won them over and they would do anything for me.

176
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,100
Absolutely. They’re so kind to me,

177
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,160
they would produce new, new technique that they knew,

178
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,070
they would produce an effect of marble out of the cement.

179
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,100
All kinds of art that they had they put there.

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,110
So such a big house with 20 bedrooms and five drawing rooms dining rooms

181
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,100
was created within one year’s time.

182
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,180
Not only that but the price of the house nobody can believe

183
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,190
was one tenth of the one that the architect would have taken.

184
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,120
But it was all written so well, everything done so well

185
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,080
because I didn’t know how to write accounts so what I used to do,

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,120
every day I used to say “Alright, today I take out so much money,

187
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,000
then this much was spent. Like that I wrote every day

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,240
and not one single rupee was missing in that.

189
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,030
So nobody could prosecute me, no problem

190
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,070
otherwise all the officers who built their houses there

191
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,120
had to go through lots of problems,

192
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,150
their income was taxed, this thing, nothing, nothing happened.

193
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,100
And I got such a huge house made in such a little money

194
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,130
and such a house that people said

195
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,000
that even Taj Mahal may fall down, this will not fall.

196
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,170
As I made a good foundation, everything,

197
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,210
because I had bricks so cheap.

198
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,040
The whole of that kiln I bought for no price at all

199
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,240
and half of it I sold back because so much remaining.

200
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,050
Then whatever I had bought the sand I brought it,

201
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,240
sold half of it because I didn't need it,

202
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
at double the price so I got my sand free.

203
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,060
The wood that I had brought from there

204
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,030
I got it properly chiseled out

205
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,080
and I had a little tank in which I put it

206
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,150
so the whole thing became absolutely, what you call that, weatherproof.

207
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,150
I got it out and half of it I used, half of it only,

208
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,000
for hundred windows and sixty doors and the rest of it I sold.

209
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,200
And even the chips were sold as burning for wood,

210
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,240
you see burning wood, what do you call that?

211
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,190
So you can imagine something was sold as timber

212
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,020
and some for the huts,

213
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,200
but I had to do cooking for them,

214
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,050
I had to look after their comfort,

215
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,200
I got them nice blankets and nice beds to sleep and this and that

216
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,240
so they were very happy.

217
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,000
That’s how a woman works out and everybody was amazed.

218
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,230
They could not find any faults with my, accounts,

219
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,000
they could not find faults with anything

220
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,230
and I told all my husband’s friends to keep five miles away from me.

221
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,170
Because he was working with the Prime Minister,

222
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,160
people would have said that: “Alright, She’s taking bribes” and things like that.

223
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,000
Then there was, another problem was that,

224
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,030
they would have come and told me: “This not good, that not good.”

225
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,240
I kept them out because only they can argue, men can only argue.

226
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,100
Women produce the results.

227
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,060
No conferences, nothing. I said: "Nothing doing",

228
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,100
"Let me do the job Myself."

229
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,170
Very nicely in the company of all these people I built the house,

230
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,220
a beautiful house which I think they have taken a film,

231
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,050
and you might be able to see the house that I built there.

232
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,140
So when the woman, who is a Sahaja yogini

233
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,140
must develop her special qualities

234
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,220
because she is very intuitive, woman is very intuitive.

235
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,070
She always reaches the right conclusion in no time.

236
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,080
If she’s a woman – but if she’s half-man and a little of a woman

237
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,240
then I don’t know what sort of a thing she is.

238
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,230
So a woman should try to be a woman, she’s so powerful,

239
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,170
she’s powerful like this Mother Earth who can bear every sort of thing

240
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,020
and she can give the best that is with her.

241
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Extremely sacrificing, extremely giving, forbearing, loving, forgiving.

242
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,000
When men develop the women’s quality then they become saints.

243
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,230
But not the woman’s quality that they run after women.

244
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,170
This kind of a nonsense is not there.

245
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,130
They have to be viras, they have to be chivalrous people,

246
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,000
They have to be brave

247
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:14,240
but with that they have to develop compassion, forgiveness.

248
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,220
But I think it is the other way round in Germany very much,

249
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,120
and I find around also among Western Sahaja Yogis

250
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,200
this is a very common affair going on.

251
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,080
Women develop horrible egos.

252
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:38,030
In India women work. Everything they do.

253
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,050
We have had great orators since long time, well known.

254
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,220
But they don’t have ego. My mother was Honours,

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,100
in those days when there were only two or three women

256
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,100
who had done such a degree,

257
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,240
but I never saw her with any ego in her.

258
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,170
My own daughters, one of them has done architecture,

259
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,030
and also interior decoration, she she’s not now working

260
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,030
because her husband is working all right,

261
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,220
but she makes houses for others, she draws for others,

262
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,170
she helps others freely. And she has such friends.

263
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,000
So what is the achievement of a woman?

264
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,060
She has more people around her.

265
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,000
Human power.

266
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,070
She has more human beings around her.

267
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,050
And what is the capacity of men?

268
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,230
They have all the bills of the house to be paid,

269
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,100
they have to pay for the insurance, the repairs of the car.

270
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,100
Let them do the dirty jobs.

271
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,030
Women receive all the love letters, from the children,

272
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,130
from the husband, from everyone.

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,120
They are loved. They are cared for.

274
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,120
Now because they have become manly

275
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,020
they don’t have all these advantages.

276
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,180
Like formerly if you are going in a bus they would give a seat to a lady.

277
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,070
Now nobody does that.

278
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,090
Once a lady was travelling, old lady

279
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,000
and there was one young fellow sitting there.

280
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,100
I said: “Why don’t you allow her to sit down?”

281
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,100
He said: “Why should I?

282
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,220
She’s also wearing a pant, I’m also wearing a pant.”

283
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,070
She was...this old lady was wearing trousers,

284
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,200
so he said: “Why should I give her seat, she’s wearing a trouser,

285
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,200
I’m wearing a trouser, what’s the difference?”

286
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,000
So all that is our advantage and privilege

287
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,150
we are losing by becoming men.

288
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And what do we gain?

289
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,200
Actually, on the contrary, I think in modern days

290
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,170
women are much more slaves of men than they were before.

291
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,000
They get very upset. Say there’s a Sahaja Yogini.

292
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,210
Now she’s caught up very badly and she has certain problems.

293
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,000
First thing she’ll think about

294
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,080
“Oh God, now my husband will leave me,

295
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,050
he’ll take away my children, where will I do?”

296
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,020
She’ll never think of Sahaja Yoga.

297
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,180
But I met one extraordinary woman, I must say she was a real woman.

298
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,180
She said: “Mother, because I’m schizophrenic

299
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,020
I want to get out of Sahaja Yoga. I’ll divorce my husband,

300
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,020
I don’t want to see my children,

301
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,020
Sahaja Yoga is much more important than me,

302
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,210
than my husband and my children."

303
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,140
"There's a woman", I said.

304
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,220
She said: “I am schizophrenic from childhood.

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,170
I’ve discovered it now and it comes back on me”.

306
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,030
But mostly women are worried about themselves.

307
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,050
“Oh God, I’ll have to leave my husband,”

308
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,180
means what they were doing was to sponge on the husband.

309
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,180
“I’ll have to leave my children.”

310
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,240
But what about leaving Sahaja Yoga?

311
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,100
If you think Sahaja Yoga is the most important

312
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,220
you’ll can get rid of your schizophrenia also.

313
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,050
Why should God help you? We are just thinking like ordinary women,

314
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,150
about yourself, only worried about yourself.

315
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,000
Not worried about Sahaja Yoga.

316
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,070
Same with some men, but men are not so much frightened

317
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,180
because they think they can stand on their legs.

318
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,000
And women should also know now they are Sahaja Yoginis

319
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,000
that they are Sahaja Yoginis and Mother is going to look after them.

320
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,120
But if you are worried about yourself only, your husband,

321
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:01,080
my house, my children, then you are a gone case,

322
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,100
you are no more a woman now. It’s not the sign of a good woman.

323
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,080
A woman is that who loves all the children.

324
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,220
Her loving capacity’s great, but if she becomes miserly,

325
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,150
if she becomes small-minded, then she’s not a woman.

326
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,100
I told you about my grand-daughters,

327
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,050
I asked them: “What do you want to be?” They’re very small.

328
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:33,240
So they said: “We want to be a nurse or an air hostess.”

329
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,020
So I said: “Why? What is so great about these jobs?”

330
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,200
They said: “Grandmother in these two jobs only you can feed people.”

331
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,020
There’s no other job in which you can really feed other.

332
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,000
The joy of feeding others is greater than writing files in the office.

333
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,050
Absolutely I tell you. It’s a horrid job to write files in the office, see.

334
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,170
It’s better to do some nice cooking,

335
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:13,000
thinking so many are going to eat and enjoy it,

336
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,100
than to do this dirty job.

337
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,220
But women have lost their heads, they are not level-headed now.

338
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Become stupid.

339
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,070
Now in Germany you have to be very careful.

340
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
In Austria you have to be very careful.

341
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,030
Austrian women are great but I would say German women

342
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,050
that you don’t try to become men.

343
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,050
First of all the best way to stop it is not to talk too much.

344
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,180
If you start talking like men then all the bhoots will enter into you

345
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,120
and start talking like men only.

346
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,070
And then you will see how the men are controlled –

347
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,170
we Indian women know how to control our men much better than you do.

348
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,180
Why we don’t have divorces? Why we don’t have problems?

349
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,180
We quarrel all right, doesn’t matter,

350
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,070
but our men don’t run after another women.

351
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:17,230
We don’t dress up s.., I mean, so much, we don’t go to hairdressers,

352
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,070
we don’t have these beauty aids, all that.

353
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,220
So develop your self-respect.

354
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,070
You are the Shakti. You are the power.

355
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:35,200
If you make your men cabbages what sort of children you’ll have?

356
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,080
Cabbages only. Respect them.

357
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,220
Make them men, enjoy their manliness.

358
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,000
Then they’ll never give you up.

359
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,150
There’s no competition between the two.

360
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,180
I find the main problem today in Gemany is

361
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,170
that the women have lost their senses.

362
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,220
This is I feel absolutely about German women.

363
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,150
Take to music, take to art. So much scope is there.

364
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,120
Today, who is remembered? See in here, who is remembered?

365
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,020
A musician, Mozart. Everyone remembers Mozart,

366
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,100
even on a chocolate you’ll find a Mozart there.

367
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,220
I don’t know poor thing did he ever eat any chocolates or not.

368
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:43,000
Or they will remember, see here, they have Michelangelo

369
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,130
or they’ll have Leonardo da Vinci, or they’ll have somebody like that.

370
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Nobody remembers who was the officer at that time,

371
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,070
running with the file, up and down.

372
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,220
So women have something that they can be of eternal value,

373
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,170
that they should develop.

374
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,120
The greatest thing is that woman can love, and love and love.

375
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,180
But when she becomes selfish and self-centred,

376
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,020
starts worrying about herself there’s no beauty in her love.

377
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,000
Today I took it up specially this thing

378
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,000
because today you are worshipping me as Kartiyeka.

379
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,000
Kartikeya was the son of Parvati Umar.

380
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:50,120
Who was just a mother of these two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

381
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:04,080
And one day the parents Shankara and Parvati both of them said:

382
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:13,170
“Out of you two, the one who goes round the Mother Earth first time

383
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,240
will get a special prize.

384
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,050
So Kartikeya was the manly power,absolutely, and he said:

385
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,130
"Alright, I’ll start on his own conveyance”  which was a peacock.

386
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,030
And Ganesha said to himself:

387
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,170
“Now look at me, I’m a little boy,

388
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,170
I am not like him and my conveyance is a little mouse.

389
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,220
How will I manage?” But then he thought:

390
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,100
'My Mother is higher than the whole universe.'

391
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,130
'What is this Mother Earth?’

392
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,070
So this Kartykeya was out, going round the Mother Earth.

393
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,080
Shri Ganesha went round his Mother three times.

394
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,100
And he got the prize!

395
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,050
Because of that motherly qualities for Him She’s the highest,

396
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,030
even higher than Sadashiva.

397
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,240
But surprisingly that is what Sadashiva likes.

398
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,200
That you respect your mother. The motherhood in you.

399
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,240
The womanhood in you.

400
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:39,100
‘Where the women are respectable and respected

401
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,170
there the Gods reside.’

402
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,100
Women are very important.

403
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,190
Of course I must blame the Western men also.

404
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
the way they have ill-treated their women,

405
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,020
have kept out of religion,, have always put them down,

406
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,000
I mean, India we had Muslims doing that

407
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,200
but they are even very sophisticated aggressors

408
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,150
and they did it very badly and they kept all of them down.

409
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,240
But doesn’t matter.

410
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Still, forgive them and try to be women.

411
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:20,200
Very powerful. The powers of a woman are that of love,

412
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,150
which are the powers of God. And that is to be used

413
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,200
than to use other argumentative intellectualism, all nonsense.

414
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,150
Don’t waste your energy with that.

415
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,150
I would like, specially the Sahaja Yoginis of Germany,

416
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,000
to become more and more ladylike.

417
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:48,070
It doesn’t mean good cooking only but in the attitude towards life.

418
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
To think in a wider way

419
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,080
that the whole Sahaja Yoga depends on our love capacity.

420
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,030
We have to be extremely loving, extremely kind,

421
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,160
looking after Sahaja Yogis,

422
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,100
giving them all the joy that is possible.

423
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,240
Otherwise in this country they can become like vampires.

424
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,070
So be very careful and for men also I would say

425
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,240
if there are women of that kind you must respect,

426
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:32,000
you must give them all their privileges, look after them.

427
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,200
They look after children but give them all the assistance,

428
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,030
all the money that is needed by them.

429
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,200
Do not ask for accounts and things, let them manage it.

430
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,120
At the most you’ll become bankrupt, as it is you are.

431
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,020
But first see what is their attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is.

432
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,030
I’ve seen in the families where the women are in charge of the purse

433
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,050
always we get much more money for Sahaja Yoga work

434
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:08,000
than from the houses where the men are in control.

435
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,130
It’s very surprising. When men are in control

436
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,050
they have to think of their car,

437
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,220
they have to think of many big things,

438
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,020
but when women are in control they know how to save money,

439
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,120
as I have shown you how I have saved money.

440
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,180
Men can never save. They can never save money.

441
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,130
Only the women can save but if they have a larger interest

442
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,200
otherwise if they are self indulgent they’ll finish off all the money

443
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,020
by going into the shop to buy a shirt for a man

444
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,050
they’ll buy all saris for themselves. They can do like that.

445
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,130
But if they have wider interests, if they have greater interest,

446
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,050
they can use money so cleverly

447
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,200
that they’ll have always money to spend for others. What do I do?

448
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,070
What has, whatever my husband gives me to run the house –

449
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,170
it’s quite a lot I should say – but I stinge on things,

450
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,080
I go to the main markets, get things from there,

451
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,170
try to save money on that, save here, save on my clothes.

452
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,050
I, first time I have given my sweaters for dry cleaning in a good shop.

453
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,200
That’s how a woman saves and then she spends for the general good.

454
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Because that is her real satisfaction.

455
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,230
If we develop that kind of a balanced view about our married life,

456
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,200
about our social life we’ll be ideal people in this world.

457
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,230
About school also, I have said it, very clearly.

458
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,030
Now if you want to hear about it

459
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,240
I would request – have you got that pamphlet with you?

460
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,200
Wanted to read it.

461
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,220
Uh? No you don’t have. That’s just like men.

462
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,180
They themselves said they would like to read it here you see.

463
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:23,030
If you ask men to do the cooking everything will be missing. So,

464
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,180
Shri Mataji, may I most respectfully ask you,

465
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,220
is there any advantage at all in being a man?

466
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,070
Without the man woman cannot express herself.

467
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,150
She cannot express, because she is the potential.

468
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,150
He is the kinetic. It’s absolutely relative terminology.

469
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,200
You cannot, exist without a man, you cannot.

470
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,170
Even if, supposing, if you have all the fragrance in the Mother Earth

471
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,150
unless and until you have the flowers

472
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,170
how will you know there is fragrance in Mother Earth?

473
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,070
Men are most important otherwise what will they do?

474
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
All their energy will be all rotten.

475
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,120
So if women are the Mother Earth you are the flowers.

476
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,170
Advantage what? You are the people who, ...everybody sees you.

477
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Running around like Kartikeya.

478
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,020
What can we do? You are like that.

479
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,150
You cannot sit at home. You cannot even in the train,

480
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,130
if you are going, you’ll find as soon as the train will stop

481
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,240
all the men will get out of the train. They can’t sit there.

482
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,170
Like, I told my husband:

483
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,200
“What is this all the time you are running out of the house?

484
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,100
Why can't you sit in the house for some time? You must sit.

485
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,070
So he said: "No, in our side if any man, sits in the house

486
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,200
he’s called as gharkombda",

487
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,180
means 'who is all the time in the house', you see.

488
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,080
And I said: “What do they call to man

489
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,030
who always runs away from the house gharbhagna

490
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,220
Means 'the run, runner away, who runs away'.

491
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,170
There should be something in between.

492
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,200
But that’s manly, it’s all right.

493
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,230
But we can, with Sahaja Yoga, what we can do

494
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,200
is to form a little balance between both the things.

495
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,220
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it gives a balance.

496
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,130
Then you start be…enjoying each other’s company so much

497
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:08,000
that even in the house you enjoy, outside also enjoy.

498
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,070
So you can be together in the house, also outside.

499
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:18,050
The interests are the same because the interest becomes the same.

500
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,230
Like the flowers who fall on the Mother Earth

501
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,000
make the Mother Earth fragrant

502
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,220
and then we can say that Mother Earth is fragrant.

503
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,000
As beautiful as that. Alright.

504
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,020
So for education I’ve already given instructions

505
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,200
and I’ve already talked about it

506
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,130
that we are not to make a big ado out of this Maria Montessori

507
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,200
and this and that. We are going to have Sahaja Yoga schools.

508
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,080
All nonsense, because I have seen

509
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,000
those who are teaching in Maria Montessori style,

510
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,200
the women have become horrible.

511
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,020
Was amazed the amount of ego they have developed in themselves.

512
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,150
So you become Sahaja Yoga teachers

513
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,030
and it’s going to be a Sahaja Yoga school.

514
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:21,030
In, Sydney or in Melbourne,

515
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,180
we started the school in Melbourne very nicely

516
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,050
and now they are going to have it in Sydney the same way.

517
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,230
And openly it is a Sahaja Yoga school, there’s no fear about it.

518
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,150
Openly it’s a Sahaja Yoga school,

519
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,080
and then people have achieved so much out of it.

520
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,180
We, why should we take any garb like that?

521
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,200
We should go all out to say its a Sahaja Yoga school.

522
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,000
So you, the teachers, also become experts in Sahaja Yoga,

523
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,080
so they have to be good Sahaja Yogis, Yoginis or Sahaja Yogis.

524
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,230
They should not be egoistical, there should be no ego in them,

525
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,220
they should not be catching,

526
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,120
anybody who’s catching is not a good teacher for Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,070
It’s not like in a Maria Montessori school

528
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,220
that in the night the teacher drinks, smokes

529
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,120
and morning time she’s a Maria Montessori teacher.

530
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,070
Here you have to be a Sahaja Yogini first

531
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,020
and then only you can teach in a Sahaja Yoga school.

532
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,100
You have to have that quality, that is very important,

533
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,050
as it is important that we should get students who are Realized Souls

534
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,020
or who can get Realization.

535
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:35,020
Alright, so today’s puja is specially for Kartikeya.

536
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:53,170
Kartikeya represents the great, we can say the captor or leader of all the ganas,

537
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:01,000
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

538
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,050
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

539
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:14,150
and because German character is to be in command of everything

540
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,230
we are going to have this puja

541
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,120
where the men will be in command of their spirits

542
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,180
and their manly qualities

543
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,120
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

544
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,230
To be in command is different from to be a master.

545
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,220
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

546
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,220
He does not own it, that is also lost.

547
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,230
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

548
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,230
And that is the state we have to come to now,

549
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,100
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

550
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,220
The other way round.

551
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,050
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

552
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:16,240
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

553
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,120
Innocence is there,

554
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:27,170
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

555
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,180
gives you a power of that commandment.

556
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,070
He commands. After the Guru Puja

557
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,150
it's better that we should have the power to command others

558
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,100
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

559
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,240
through their talking, through their dynamism,

560
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,050
through their personal achievements;

561
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,120
for the women through their loving power,

562
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:09,030
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

563
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,050
forgiveness, compassion.

564
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,150
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

565
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,190
means it’s not that what we have

566
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,100
but in a position we are to command.

567
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,170
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

568
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,030
May God Bless You.
