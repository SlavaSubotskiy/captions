1
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:47,739
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

2
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,742
we have gathered here

3
00:01:53,943 --> 00:02:01,107
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

4
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,200
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

5
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:15,348
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

6
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,621
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

7
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:25,337
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

8
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:32,166
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

9
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:38,234
and that you can do this Puja performed.

10
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:41,385
It's your right.

11
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:45,401
You are chosen for this.

12
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:49,554
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

13
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:52,020
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

14
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:59,572
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

15
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:11,439
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

16
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:27,254
These are specially created cells

17
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:31,376
through the working of the Swadishthana.

18
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:35,774
Passing through all the chakras,

19
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,071
when they arrive at Sahasrara

20
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:47,503
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

21
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:56,678
without getting involved into

22
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,419
other elements in the body.

23
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,849
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

24
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:18,068
are not to be involved with the other cells -

25
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,270
human beings,

26
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,830
of the body of this universe.

27
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:35,734
The first thing that happens

28
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,940
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

29
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:45,008
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

30
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,519
So, many things he transcends:

31
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,493
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

32
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:56,936
Time is his slave.

33
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:01,050
If you have to go somewhere

34
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:07,361
then suddenly you discover

35
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:15,179
that everything is working about the same time

36
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,059
when you are able to do it.

37
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:27,890
Like you are, say, to catch a train

38
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,758
and you arrive late at the station,

39
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,704
you find the train is late for you.

40
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,688
Things work out in such a way that you feel

41
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:51,373
they are all active for your complete convenience.

42
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:56,081
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

43
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:00,259
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

44
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,286
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

45
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,205
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

46
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:11,070
you just don't do it.

47
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:16,288
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

48
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:22,085
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

49
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:24,848
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

50
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:30,679
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

51
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,393
either with lust,
greed, at something,

52
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:42,193
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

53
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:54,825
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

54
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:59,744
means the attention loses its dharma.

55
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:08,951
The dharma of the attention are such that

56
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:14,625
we have to put

57
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:20,208
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

58
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:27,224
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

59
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:34,777
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

60
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:39,860
and when they attack us,

61
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:45,463
then

62
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:51,282
we have to have some measures to control it.

63
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:56,451
So we build up our dharmas,

64
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:00,488
our rules and regulation,

65
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,935
and control them, the dharmas,

66
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:09,003
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

67
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:13,407
This is the greatness of human beings,

68
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:20,258
that they have made their own dharmas

69
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,426
established on top of the lower dharmas.

70
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:27,791
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

71
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,130
It has to be in four valences;

72
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:32,916
it acts according to the four valences,

73
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:36,161
it cannot make it six.

74
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:41,993
But human beings can make

75
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:45,462
those valences established which are supposed to be

76
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:50,436
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

77
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:55,788
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

78
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,903
means, you don't have need,

79
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,196
there’s no need,

80
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:06,836
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

81
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:09,164
You don't have to discipline,

82
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:12,696
but you get disciplined automatically.

83
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:16,346
That is the first sign of a person

84
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:21,932
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

85
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,823
Attention doesn't get attached

86
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:30,442
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

87
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:36,244
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

88
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:43,151
So you become ‘kalateet’.

89
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,763
You become ‘dharmateet’.

90
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,042
You become ‘gunateet’.

91
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:53,977
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

92
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:58,494
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

93
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:04,801
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

94
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:07,658
of your attention.

95
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:14,344
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

96
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:19,529
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

97
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:28,609
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

98
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,936
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

99
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,902
which is ‘satvika’.

100
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,122
Where a person tries to control

101
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:49,125
all his enemies of lust, anger,

102
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:56,315
pride, vanity, attachments

103
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:59,297
and greed.

104
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:07,158
All these restrictions

105
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:11,270
on the attention get lost

106
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:17,798
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

107
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:23,327
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

108
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:33,258
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

109
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,910
and you become ‘satgunis’-

110
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,769
means virtuous,

111
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:48,584
but not by discipline,

112
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:52,270
but spontaneously.

113
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:55,847
You become righteous spontaneously.

114
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,438
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

115
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,917
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

116
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:11,593
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

117
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:15,856
in the sense, in front of the temples.

118
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,990
According to laws, we should not have temper,

119
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:28,564
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

120
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:32,984
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

121
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:39,546
which is not to be analyzed,

122
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:44,322
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

123
00:12:44,523 --> 00:12:49,108
the killing of the rakshasas,

124
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,511
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

125
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:56,680
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

126
00:12:56,881 --> 00:13:00,677
they are all dead already.

127
00:13:03,045 --> 00:13:06,762
They all get explained because you go beyond.

128
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:11,476
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

129
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:15,504
Only the one who can control is beyond.

130
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:19,580
The one who is in it cannot control it.

131
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:26,137
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

132
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:32,991
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

133
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:37,082
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

134
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:51,418
But, when it comes to the knowledge

135
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:56,476
about such a person, you cannot think,

136
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:04,075
because such a person is beyond thinking.

137
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,075
You cannot describe

138
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:11,955
because such a person cannot describe.

139
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:18,410
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

140
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,853
take the poison?

141
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:30,213
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

142
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:36,665
That's beyond human comprehension.

143
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:40,612
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

144
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,682
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

145
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:49,349
Your certificates come from God Almighty

146
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,901
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

147
00:14:55,102 --> 00:15:00,922
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

148
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:10,604
So you reach a state

149
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:13,719
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

150
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,021
means ‘without’,

151
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,396
without.

152
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:29,792
So such a person

153
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:34,383
is without thought; he doesn't think.

154
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:45,246
Such a person is without greed,

155
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:50,759
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

156
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:58,988
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

157
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:08,495
out of which nothing is left out.

158
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:12,722
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

159
00:16:12,923 --> 00:16:16,663
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

160
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:21,465
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

161
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,390
because it reaches a point all the time

162
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:30,210
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

163
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:34,114
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

164
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:40,273
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

165
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:48,996
Vacuum of all the negative,

166
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:55,866
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

167
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,522
Such a person is eternal being.

168
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:11,322
Nobody can kill,

169
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:17,397
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

170
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:24,368
The anger

171
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,434
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

172
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:34,563
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

173
00:17:34,764 --> 00:17:46,656
He is not elated by praises

174
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:52,701
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

175
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:56,987
the boons of the ego.

176
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:15,154
So the third state where he reaches,

177
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:21,059
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

178
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,145
Nihi.

179
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:31,268
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

180
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:37,195
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

181
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:41,083
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

182
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,692
But the word is 'Nihi'.

183
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:48,447
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

184
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,565
 ‘nih’ -

185
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:59,885
that means

186
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,742
‘sheer’.

187
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:14,452
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

188
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:24,157
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

189
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:31,592
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

190
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,793
Like when you say

191
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:52,834
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

192
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:55,449
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

193
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,939
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

194
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:07,765
But this word is used,

195
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,108
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

196
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:20,077
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

197
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:26,239
without or devoid of.

198
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,949
The another form is:

199
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,595
the only - absolute;

200
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,422
the absolute.

201
00:20:42,946 --> 00:20:48,255
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

202
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,124
nothing but joy.

203
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:54,301
It's complete freedom.

204
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:58,638
So you have all kinds of joys,

205
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:05,067
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

206
00:21:05,268 --> 00:21:09,088
the joy of the Spirit.

207
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:17,259
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

208
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:21,491
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

209
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:26,465
where you have the joy of the play.

210
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,692
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

211
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,565
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

212
00:21:36,766 --> 00:21:40,797
means, sheer absolute joy.

213
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,212
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

214
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,691
it means absolute.

215
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,873
So when you put such an adjective before

216
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:56,764
anything else it becomes absolute.

217
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:11,867
Thus you become absolute.

218
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:20,784
And when you are at that state of absolute

219
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:27,195
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

220
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:37,868
But let us see what is absolute.

221
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:47,373
That means it is not relative;

222
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,928
it has no relative qualities.

223
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:55,279
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

224
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,190
it cannot be compared.

225
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,044
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

226
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:10,672
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

227
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:14,407
anything else through which we can comprehend;

228
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,287
it is absolute.

229
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,524
Whatever way you try to know it

230
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:31,935
you go away from absolute.

231
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:42,843
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

232
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:58,574
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

233
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,136
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

234
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:08,475
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

235
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:13,129
means the anand of the body,

236
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:21,824
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

237
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:28,654
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

238
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:33,245
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

239
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,597
But the state has now

240
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,784
to be established within us is of Niranand.

241
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:48,510
Then what is the question of fear?

242
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:54,202
What is the question of talking about it?

243
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:59,287
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

244
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:03,972
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

245
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:08,703
There are no words for absolute to describe.

246
00:25:08,904 --> 00:25:11,523
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

247
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:15,091
what remains is absolute.

248
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:22,879
So you reach the state of absolute.

249
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:28,410
And that is the state

250
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:33,568
a complete communication is established

251
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:38,505
and in that communication you have nobody else

252
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,979
but the absolute within you.

253
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,793
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

254
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,167
That is the level to which you should aspire.

255
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:04,944
That should be the ascent,

256
00:26:05,145 --> 00:26:09,676
which should be established within ourselves.

257
00:26:10,793 --> 00:26:13,227
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

258
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:16,846
we don't have to do anything drastic.

259
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:22,508
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

260
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:26,630
the only, ‘kevalam’.

261
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:36,720
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

262
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:45,881
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

263
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:52,074
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

264
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:57,413
Just by surrendering you become.

265
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:02,915
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

266
00:27:03,116 --> 00:27:10,280
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

267
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:14,970
It is absolute love,

268
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:18,671
it is absolute compassion;

269
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:22,702
it is absolute power.

270
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,126
The words stop,

271
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:42,702
the description stops;

272
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,690
you just become the absolute

273
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:54,737
and feel your absoluteness through it

274
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:58,328
with that oneness.

275
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:05,234
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

276
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,003
There’s no company needed.

277
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:16,407
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

278
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:28,879
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

279
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,415
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

280
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:44,112
May God bless you.
