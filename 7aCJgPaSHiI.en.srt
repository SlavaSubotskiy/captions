- Shri Mataji [GERMAN INTERPRETER]

159
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Yesterday, I told you that Truth is to be discovered

160
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,340
on your Central Nervous system through the evolutionary process

161
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
[INTERPRETER]

[INTERPRETER]

165
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,460
and to believe into something because somebody is telling you

166
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,720
in a very convincing manner.

167
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:01,280
[INTERPRETER]

168
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,200
Even, you have not to believe Me, what I tell you.

169
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,800
[INTERPRETER]

170
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,040
As I said yesterday, you have to treat it like a hypothesis

171
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,640
and with an open mind of a scientist to discover the Truth yourself.

172
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,280
[INTERPRETER]

173
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,400
[INTERPRETER]

174
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,060
It is your lookout that you have to be convinced;

175
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,940
I am not here to convince you

176
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:49,540
[INTERPRETER]

177
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,300
- or to persuade you to believe into something
- [INTERPRETER]

178
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,160
because even if you believe in Me, believe in what I say,

179
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,220
if you do not get the experience of Self-realization, it is of no value.

180
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,320
[INTERPRETER]

181
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,360
[INTERPRETER]

182
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,520
Now today, as I told you yesterday, how the human awareness, which has got

183
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:32,340
it's roots in the brain, starts growing downward and takes us to our destruction in every center

184
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,100
[INTERPRETER]

185
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,720
[INTERPRETER]

186
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:50,340
and unless and until we get the ascent, we, our human awareness can never take us

187
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,040
to that place where we say that this is the Self, the Spirit.

188
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,460
[INTERPRETER]

189
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,440
[INTERPRETER]

190
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:14,580
So, every human effort to experience new things or to try new things is nothing

191
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,820
but amounts to a ego trip -

192
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,580
[INTERPRETER]

193
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,560
- is not reality.
- [INTERPRETER]

194
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:39,600
Now today, I would like to tell you what happens if our human awareness moves to the left or to the right.

195
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,960
[INTERPRETER]

196
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,420
Now in our system there is something called Autonomous Nervous System,

197
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,020
which means, auto means somebody driven by self.

198
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,900
It is driven by self - autonomous. So, what is this self?

199
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:13,060
[INTERPRETER]

200
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,460
[INTERPRETER]

201
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:23,980
Now, this Autonomous Nervous System is divided into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems within us.

202
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:31,180
[INTERPRETER]

203
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,780
On the subtler level, the left side that you see here, what we call as Ida Nadi, in the Sanskrit language,

204
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,220
manifests the left, the Left Sympathetic Nervous System

205
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,500
and the one which is on the right hand side, which starts from the Swadhishtana - the yellow colored one -

206
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,760
is the one, what we call as, the Pingala Nadi.

207
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:04,180
[INTERPRETER]

208
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,840
[INTERPRETER]

209
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,320
[INTERPRETER]

210
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:23,380
- It manifests the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

211
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,660
Now the central path, that you see here half-broken, is the path of Kundalini,

212
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,820
which, actually, manifests

213
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,600
in us the Parasympathetic Nervous System and is called as Sushumna Nadi in the Sanskrit language.

214
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,360
[INTERPRETER]

215
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,560
[INTERPRETER]

216
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,160
By the left Nadi, that you see here the blue colored one,

217
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,460
you desire something - is a power of desire.

218
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,860
[INTERPRETER]

219
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,520
- It looks after our emotional side
- [INTERPRETER]

220
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,980
and is somewhere near Freud's id, we can call it but he was very confused -

221
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,060
but is the one that looks after your past and your conditioning.

222
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,480
[INTERPRETER]

223
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,060
[INTERPRETER]

224
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,460
So, this is the one that gives you your conditioning or your past.

225
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,740
[INTERPRETER]

226
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:56,540
Now the right side one that you see, the yellow one, is the one that gives you your future

227
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,000
[INTERPRETER]

228
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,580
and this is the one which works on your physical and your mental level

229
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,760
[INTERPRETER]

230
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:23,360
so that you have now - left hand side is emotional and the physical and the mental side on the right side.

231
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,920
[INTERPRETER]

232
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,680
I must confess, English language is extremely confusing

233
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,020
[INTERPRETER]

234
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,160
because the one who suffers from the mental side,

235
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,640
uh.. they say, is actually suffering from the emotional side

236
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,580
[INTERPRETER]

237
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,400
[INTERPRETER]

238
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,340
So, let us take an exact word for that, is the

239
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,820
when we say the mind, we mean the emotional side.

240
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,080
[INTERPRETER]

241
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,820
[INTERPRETER]

242
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,040
[ASIDE - I think, that will do.] and the Kundalini, you say, is the fourth power within us,

243
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,120
which is coiled up in three and a half coils and is lying in that

244
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,160
sacrum bone, as we call it, in a sleeping state.

245
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,900
[INTERPRETER]

246
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,400
[INTERPRETER]

247
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,720
[ASIDE - That will do, I'll manage. It's alright. Thank You.]

248
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,340
Now we have seen these four powers within us.

249
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,920
First is the left side power of desire, right side power of action

250
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,640
and the central path of our evolution.

251
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,200
[INTERPRETER]

252
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,560
[INTERPRETER]

253
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,320
Now whatever we have evolved, is shown on our Central Nervous System which records everything.

254
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:37,600
[INTERPRETER]

255
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,700
We can say that all these three powers built-in

256
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,300
the program of the Central Nervous System.

257
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:54,900
[INTERPRETER]

258
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:01,760
Now say, for animals, you ask a horse to pass through a dirty lane

259
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,360
or a dog - he will just go through, he will not have any problems

260
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,280
but for a human-being, to go through a dirty lane, will be very difficult.

261
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:17,540
[INTERPRETER]

262
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,960
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, on our Central Nervous System

263
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:31,040
we have built-in a new capacity to see beauty, to see color, to see uh..

264
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,880
the dirt and filth, on our Central Nervous System.

265
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,280
[INTERPRETER]

266
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,140
[INTERPRETER]

267
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,740
Human-beings need not be told that this is smelling dirty - they can smell it.

268
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,280
[INTERPRETER]

269
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,340
As in Sanskrit it is said, "Nahin kasturi ka modaha shapathe namo bhavyathe."

270
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,820
The smell of the musk need not be vowed for; It exists, you can see it yourself.

271
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:17,620
[INTERPRETER]

272
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:24,740
In the same way, our Central Nervous System records all that we have gained

273
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,920
through our past, through our conditioning and also what we think about our future.

274
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,500
[INTERPRETER]

275
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,720
[INTERPRETER]

276
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,880
Now, when you start moving towards the left side in your attention,

277
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,800
you become, sort of, very emotional person.

278
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,760
[INTERPRETER]

279
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,300
- Like, we can say, a Greek tragedy
- [INTERPRETER]

280
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,660
you indulge into something tragic - you enjoy tragedies.

281
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,660
[INTERPRETER]

282
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,520
You are a happily married man still you like to hear the songs of separation.

283
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,460
[INTERPRETER]

284
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,260
You have everything and a nice wife

285
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,200
but still you are thinking of somebody and unnecessarily you are miserable.

286
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,340
[INTERPRETER]

287
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,660
Then this devotion can go to anything - it can go to God also

288
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:51,460
[INTERPRETER]

289
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:58,080
- as we call it as bhakti cult.
- [INTERPRETER]

290
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,120
I mean, they will go on saying, "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama,"

291
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,920
thousand times, sometimes six thousand times, like mad.

292
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:14,260
[INTERPRETER]

293
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,640
- or like, "Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ," they'll go on.
- [INTERPRETER]

294
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,180
They will just, sort of, without any connection with Christ or without any connection with Ram,

295
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,240
just imaginary emotions they will start putting on God.

296
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,080
[INTERPRETER]

297
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,580
This bhakti cult we had in India much before anywhere it started, I think.

298
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:53,260
[INTERPRETER]

299
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,680
So, they are running on the street, all of them, 'Hare Rama, hare Krishna,' running on the street like mad, has no meaning.

300
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,500
[INTERPRETER]

301
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:14,440
As a result of this kind of a chanting on the left hand side, you develop a kind of a very funny cancer,

302
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,020
[INTERPRETER]

303
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,360
which also can result into a situation, where we call it,

304
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,440
as the Left Vishuddhi catch where you feel unnecessarily guilty.

305
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:39,240
[INTERPRETER]

306
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,140
It becomes a fashion with people to say you're miserable and that you're very guilty, for nothing at all

307
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:52,480
[INTERPRETER]

308
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,560
and to say that you must go into misery is the same nonsense that you go to the left side.

309
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:06,100
[INTERPRETER]

310
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:13,960
You cannot go into any situation yourself and achieve it as far as spirituality is concerned

311
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:21,380
[INTERPRETER]

312
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,440
but, you must know that the Spiritual ascent is a living process

313
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,900
and is evolutionary process which works spontaneously.

314
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,220
[INTERPRETER]

315
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,300
[INTERPRETER]

316
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,740
So, going towards left side is even more dangerous than going towards right side.

317
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,060
[INTERPRETER]

318
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,500
Left-sided people don't torture others but torture themselves.

319
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,760
[INTERPRETER]

320
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:12,900
Now the area they entered into, first of all, is their past, this past, this life's past.

321
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,000
[INTERPRETER]

322
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,020
- Then they enter into their own past
- [INTERPRETER]

323
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:31,960
This is a very wrong thing, these days some people have started asking about your past, past - it's a very dangerous area.

324
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,720
[INTERPRETER]

325
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,860
- Past is finished and gone - it doesn't exist.
- [INTERPRETER]

326
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,040
Now, when you go beyond that, you go into the very, very dangerous area called

327
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,560
Collective Subconscious area.

328
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,420
[INTERPRETER]

329
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:08,140
- From Subconscious to the Collective Subconscious
- [INTERPRETER]

330
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,740
- This one, I say, is the most dangerous area.
- [INTERPRETER]

331
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,140
Now supposing, you were a very right-sided person and you are vulnerable to cancer -

332
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,320
first thing you'll catch will be cancer

333
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,860
[INTERPRETER]

334
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,160
[INTERPRETER]

335
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,460
because into the, into the Collective Subconscious all that is dead

336
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,000
since the time of our creation is there within us.

337
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:50,460
[INTERPRETER]

338
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,100
This is all accepted now by the doctors that these cancer is caused by

339
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:04,060
Protein 52 and Protein 58 which are built within us

340
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,480
in an area about which they don't know - they are very honest - but into the area

341
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,340
which is within us since our creation - is an accepted fact.

342
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,940
[INTERPRETER]

343
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:27,860
[INTERPRETER]

344
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,540
So, when you start experimenting like this,

345
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,560
even Freud and all this nonsense, when you start experimenting, you go to your left side.

346
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,860
[INTERPRETER]

347
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,980
Say, as I said, on Vishuddhi chakra, if you go on taking the name of somebody's continuously

348
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,220
then somebody, who is dead with that name in the atmosphere, just enters into your body

349
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,500
[INTERPRETER]

350
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,860
[INTERPRETER]

351
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,660
[INTERPRETER]

352
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,560
- and you can get completely possessed.
- [INTERPRETER]

353
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:22,040
Like, somebody who was, he used to take Christ's name and he started feeling he's become Christ.

354
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,120
[INTERPRETER]

355
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,520
[INTERPRETER]

356
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,940
- and he came to Me he said, "I'm Christ."
- [INTERPRETER]

357
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,620
- I said, 'Alright, then walk on the water.'
- [INTERPRETER]

358
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,920
- 'If you can do that I will believe it.'
- [INTERPRETER]

359
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:54,500
So, this is what happens like Gauguin, now a great artist as you know him, died as a mad man and

360
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:03,040
somebody who used to copy him and used to think of him all the time, read about him, suddenly he started painting like Gauguin.

361
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,360
[INTERPRETER]

362
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,360
[INTERPRETER]

363
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:22,120
Nothing new but the same thing he was putting on the canvas and I saw this on a television

364
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,060
show that he was saying, "I am possessed by Gauguin."

365
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,560
[INTERPRETER]

366
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,160
[INTERPRETER]

367
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:42,780
Now many people think that, if they are born and they can tell about their past - it is their own past.

368
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:50,700
[INTERPRETER]

369
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:58,500
It is not necessary that it is your own past, it might be some possession is sitting on you and you are telling your past.

370
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,440
[INTERPRETER]

371
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,000
[INTERPRETER]

372
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,800
and it may be the past of that person who died.

373
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,100
[INTERPRETER]

374
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,160
Now this possession business is so secretive and so dangerous that people have no idea about it.

375
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,300
[INTERPRETER]

376
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,580
[INTERPRETER]

377
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,240
It is a special art, which is practiced in India and everywhere as witchcraft,

378
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,000
by which people get hold of these dead spirits and put them on others and try to capture them.

379
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:52,500
[INTERPRETER]

380
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,540
[INTERPRETER]

381
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:03,360
- It may be called as black magic or anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

382
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,260
- Most of the gurus try this trick
- [INTERPRETER]

383
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,000
- and they possess the people
- [INTERPRETER]

384
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,940
so much so, that people become absolutely mad, give away all their money,

385
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,260
give away everything they have and they don't see that this man is just exploiting them.

386
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,420
[INTERPRETER]

387
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,820
[INTERPRETER]

388
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:41,460
Ultimately, there can be a complete suicide of all the people they can take to

389
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,300
[INTERPRETER]

390
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,760
or there may be people, individuals who might get into epilepsy.

391
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,380
[INTERPRETER]

392
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,300
- Epilepsy is a sign of possession
- [INTERPRETER]

393
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:11,260
- and such a man is not within himself.
- [INTERPRETER]

394
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,020
He might get such a terrible power within himself that even ten people cannot control.

395
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,080
[INTERPRETER]

396
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:30,220
The other day, I saw a child of one year possessed and three people could not hold her and were perspiring.

397
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:39,480
[INTERPRETER]

398
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,580
This is what happens when you get possessed by some sort of a devilish personality.

399
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:51,480
[INTERPRETER]

400
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:58,220
Many people, who become mad or all them who become mad, are possessed.

401
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even Schizophrenia comes from the same.

402
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,920
[INTERPRETER]

403
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:16,980
All disturbances of the mental level, so called mental, I mean the emotional level, are from this possession.

404
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,840
[INTERPRETER]

405
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,680
Suddenly, a person starts screaming or shouting or behaving in a different manner

406
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,200
it doesn't explain - it is nothing but a possession.

407
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:40,640
[INTERPRETER]

408
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,080
Many people ask Me, why in America there is so much schizophrenia?

409
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,520
[INTERPRETER]

410
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,040
Because so many of these Indians were killed by Spanish.

411
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:02,320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Maybe they are possessing.

412
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:09,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Specially the people who have been to Vietnam are possessed people, absolutely.

413
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,000
[INTERPRETER]

414
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,520
They are very abnormal and

415
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,260
very sly and always running away from society.

416
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,160
[INTERPRETER]

417
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,660
- Also some of the drugs take you to the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

418
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,740
- Alcohol also takes you to the left side;
- [INTERPRETER]

419
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,400
Excessive alcohol drinking can really make you a mad man.

420
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,700
[INTERPRETER]

421
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,520
So, all these things lead you to the left side and you suffer from

422
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,960
not only mental troubles but also physical troubles.

423
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:08,680
[INTERPRETER]

424
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:15,420
- Such a person always is very lethargic.
- [INTERPRETER]

425
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,320
He doesn't want to work, he wants to sleep all the time and he is not very neat or clean

426
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,000
[INTERPRETER]

427
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:36,240
and if you try to organize such a person, he gets very annoyed, can be extremely violent.

428
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:43,340
[INTERPRETER]

429
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:51,800
Now you, one can go through chakras and chakras and see how on every chakra there is a possibility of your movement to the left side.

430
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,060
[INTERPRETER]

431
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:04,400
For example, if you are suddenly frightened by someone or you have a very frightful experience

432
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:13,020
and you are absolutely lost, that time you can go to the left side and you can

433
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,220
catch it, the way, what we call, the possession.

434
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:23,960
[INTERPRETER]

435
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,980
[INTERPRETER]

436
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,000
Say for example, you parents have been not kind to you or you had a very bad childhood

437
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,180
when in as childhood, when the child needed the attention of the mother and

438
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,700
father and love from them, he was ill-treated,

439
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:51,600
then the child can become extremely left-sided or right-sided depending on his temperament

440
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,620
but when he's left-sided, he develops very funny symptoms.

441
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:01,240
[INTERPRETER]

442
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:07,540
[INTERPRETER]

443
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:15,040
[INTERPRETER]

444
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:22,900
People achieve it also by giving you wrong type of food which is being done by with some sort of a black magic;

445
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,700
When you eat that food, you can go to the left side and you can get possessed.

446
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,280
[INTERPRETER]

447
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,600
[INTERPRETER]

448
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,780
Some of the gurus give those ashes which actually come from the crematoriums.

449
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,320
[INTERPRETER]

450
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,140
Such people can suffer from terrible skin troubles.

451
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,140
[INTERPRETER]

452
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:04,740
It is such a secretive knowledge that it is not easy for you to understand unless and until you get your realization.

453
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,780
[INTERPRETER]

454
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:19,200
On the Swadhisthana Chakra, it could be a person who is a very, very dynamic person,

455
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:26,680
who is showing good results in art or in creativity, can be over-doing everything,

456
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,320
is exerting too much onto that or going into it's imagination, may be caught up or

457
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,220
maybe, somehow or the other, cursed by someone, so he stops all his activity.

458
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,480
[INTERPRETER]

459
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:51,540
[INTERPRETER]

460
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:59,020
So, when we start experimenting, we should know that with human awareness, either you'll go to the left or to the right.

461
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:07,100
[INTERPRETER]

462
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,820
The best way people achieve mesmerism is through their eyes.

463
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:19,220
[INTERPRETER]

464
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:25,500
They ask a person to look into his eyes and then somehow or other, try to possess that person.

465
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:30,320
or could be, that this Agnya Chakra they can turn it in such a way that

466
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,200
in the opposite direction, so that the person gets possessed.

467
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,600
[INTERPRETER]

468
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,160
[INTERPRETER]

469
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:52,780
The worst is the possession on the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the lowest chakra here, on your sex.

470
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:59,700
[INTERPRETER]

471
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,500
Many gurus or many people use this chakra to entice people and then it is

472
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,600
very difficult to get these people out of that.

473
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:16,580
[INTERPRETER]

474
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,140
We stand in great danger because we do not know what one will do to us and when we start

475
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,760
in darkness some sort of an experiment, it's a very, very dangerous sign.

476
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:34,080
[INTERPRETER]

477
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:41,100
- [INTERPRETER]
- So it is very important, before you take to any such experiments,

478
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:47,000
you must first find out the disciples of such a guru or the people who are around such a guru,

479
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:54,620
how are they, how do they look like, are they knowledgeable? How, what is their lifestyle, what sort of people they are?

480
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:03,200
[INTERPRETER]

481
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,600
[INTERPRETER]

482
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:15,840
But human-beings are dare-devils and they try to do things which can be very injurious.

483
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,440
[INTERPRETER]

484
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,140
[INTERPRETER]

485
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:31,800
Like, I would say, we see a person coming out of a pub, who just falls off of over-drinking

486
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,420
and we try to, sort of, again go into the pub.

487
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,040
[INTERPRETER]

488
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:44,600
[INTERPRETER]

489
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:53,020
All the chakras can be affected by Mooladhara, if you're caught up on Mooladhara, and then you develop all these diseases

490
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,260
like Parkinson, Mellitus, all these degenerating things.

491
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:05,800
[INTERPRETER]

492
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:12,040
[INTERPRETER]

493
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,160
So, any kind of extreme behavior can lead you to the left or to the right.

494
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:23,520
[INTERPRETER]

495
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,440
So, before starting any experiment, you must see the person who is started the experiment, where is he.

496
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:38,380
[INTERPRETER]

497
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,940
Now, say, for example Freud - he was epileptic, he had cancer

498
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,700
and he was a funny man as far as the mother was concerned, so still people followed him.

499
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,220
[INTERPRETER]

500
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,360
[INTERPRETER]

501
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,460
And some people followed him to such an extent that they replaced him with Christ.

502
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:11,420
[INTERPRETER]

503
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:18,220
Even if somebody says that, "We are very religious people, we are very spiritual people," you must see what sort of life they lead.

504
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:25,020
[INTERPRETER]

505
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:31,340
- Are they normal people or are they abnormal?
- [INTERPRETER]

506
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,060
Now, to the right side now. The movement starts on the right side of our awareness.

507
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,040
[INTERPRETER]

508
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:49,360
As I told you, is the action - on the right side we perform through our physical and mental activity - for our future also.

509
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,120
[INTERPRETER]

510
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,700
[INTERPRETER]

511
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Now on the physical side, supposing, somebody starts over-doing something, then what happens to a person like that.

512
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,640
[INTERPRETER]

513
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,260
- For example, take jogging.
- [INTERPRETER]

514
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,640
It's very common disease nowadays - everybody is running on the road.

515
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:27,160
[INTERPRETER]

516
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:34,540
- Everybody is trying to become a cinema actor.
- [INTERPRETER]

517
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,860
Now, what we have to understand that jogging is only physical exercise

518
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,860
and if you overdo it, you will develop physically but what about your emotional side?

519
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,900
[INTERPRETER]

520
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,080
[INTERPRETER]

521
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,380
You will seldom find a happy jogger - they're always miserable.

522
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:06,480
[INTERPRETER]

523
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,400
There will be a fight between the wife, maybe a divorce after sometime.

524
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,020
[INTERPRETER]

525
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,040
I met one dentist. He told Me, "Now, I've become absolutely a saint." I said, "How?" He said, "I've been jogging, jogging

526
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:30,900
now I don't feel anything. I didn't feel the death of my child, I didn't feel the death of my wife, nothing I feel - I've become a yogi."

527
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:39,000
[INTERPRETER]

528
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,520
[INTERPRETER]

529
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:50,080
[INTERPRETER]

530
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:55,800
- And he was thin like a bean stick, I tell you,
- [INTERPRETER]

531
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,720
and still he was trying to jog because the habit he could not give up.

532
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,460
His, I mean, his bones used to run on the streets - the skeleton.

533
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:13,200
[INTERPRETER]

534
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,740
He could not give up that habit despite that he'd lost all his weight.

535
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,900
[INTERPRETER]

536
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:31,960
Same thing with any physical exercise if you do indiscriminately - for example, take Hatha yoga.

537
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:38,700
If you start doing Hatha yoga, every type of asana without understanding what is your problem, where the Kundalini is stopping,

538
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:44,420
you indiscriminately start doing Hatha yoga, you might develop terrible problems of the heart

539
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:53,060
[INTERPRETER]

540
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:59,620
[INTERPRETER]

541
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,520
and one becomes a very fiery person, extremely angry, hot-tempered

542
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:08,020
[INTERPRETER]

543
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,600
- and very dry.
- [INTERPRETER]

544
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,800
They have no love, they have no tolerance, they cannot bear anything.

545
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,180
[INTERPRETER]

546
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:26,880
I would say some French - you can meet them - because they eat lot of fungus, their liver goes out

547
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,700
and then they are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

548
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:36,840
[INTERPRETER]

549
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,360
[INTERPRETER]

550
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:46,500
- They eat every kind of fungus.
- [INTERPRETER]

551
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,560
There are 200 type of cheese they have got which has got fungus in it.

552
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:56,020
[INTERPRETER]

553
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,260
I mean, if you put a little fungus on your hand, all your life you cannot get rid of it - it's so horrid.

554
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,420
[INTERPRETER]

555
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,080
[INTERPRETER]

556
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,520
So now, when we start thinking too much,

557
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,740
on the mental side what happens to our body?

558
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,740
[INTERPRETER]

559
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,360
- We think of the future.
- [INTERPRETER]

560
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,920
Telescopic we become, we become very speedy.

561
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:38,460
[INTERPRETER]

562
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:45,640
Like you see, if there's a train coming, such a person has to arrive at the station which is,

563
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,420
say at A point; He will reach at B point where the train doesn't stop.

564
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:57,540
[INTERPRETER]

565
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,880
[INTERPRETER]

566
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:07,960
- They go on thinking, thinking like mad -
- [INTERPRETER]

567
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,100
- produce no results
- [INTERPRETER]
- and this is so maddening

568
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,660
that such a person can become extremely dry.

569
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:21,760
[INTERPRETER]

570
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:29,800
- and this dryness can have effect on all the chakras.
- [INTERPRETER]

571
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:37,400
- Like, on the Mooladhara he becomes a constipated person;
- [INTERPRETER]

572
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:45,120
- He develops all the problems of constipation;
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then he has too much heat in the body;

573
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:51,320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then at Swadhishthana he develops a very bad liver;

574
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:59,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Liver becomes absolutely dried up;
- [INTERPRETER]

575
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:06,140
Liver is the one that takes away all our poison and passes on to the water of the blood

576
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:13,880
[INTERPRETER]

577
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:20,880
but when there is not sufficient water, the heat remains there and liver starts troubling such a person and he develops horrible things like

578
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,680
like, biliousness and ultimately cirrhosis of the liver.

579
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:32,900
[INTERPRETER]

580
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:39,320
[INTERPRETER]

581
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:45,420
So, the liver starts spoiling, spoiling your attention and you cannot enjoy anything, you don't like anything.

582
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:52,900
[INTERPRETER]

583
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:58,220
You cannot eat much, you feel giddy and if you sit in the Sun or anything,

584
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,140
you becomes really, absolutely burnt up.

585
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:10,400
[INTERPRETER]

586
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:18,140
Now, this yellow line is called also Surya Nadi - means the uh.. channel of the Sun.

587
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,120
[INTERPRETER]

588
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:32,500
- These right-sided people are very much fond of the Sun also
-  [INTERPRETER]

589
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:38,700
They go to the sea-shore and burn their skins in addition to what they have already burnts inside.

590
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:46,120
[INTERPRETER]

591
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,840
- and develop cancer of the skin.
- [INTERPRETER]

592
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:57,560
It is another way of futuristic thinking gives you a very serious trouble of attack all heart attack.

593
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,000
[INTERPRETER]

594
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,820
- which is, which has a spiritual significance.
- [INTERPRETER]

595
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:14,620
A person, who is extremely aggressive and extrovert, his attention is always outside

596
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,820
[INTERPRETER]

597
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:25,740
- and not on his heart, not on his Spirit.
-  [INTERPRETER]

598
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,800
As a result of that, Spirit sleeps off and he gets a massive heart attack.

599
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:38,840
[INTERPRETER]

600
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:47,420
There's another thing, as I told you, that one can develop Diabetes and all those things because of too much of aggressiveness.

601
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,000
[INTERPRETER]

602
01:05:54,220 --> 01:06:01,040
But the aggressiveness of the tongue gives you all kinds of problems of the Vishuddhi, here.

603
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:08,040
[INTERPRETER]

604
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:15,620
If you shout too much and if you aggress people by your talking, try to put them down

605
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:23,840
by your talking, try to take their charge by your talking, sharpness, you develop all the problems of the right Vishuddhi.

606
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:30,400
[INTERPRETER]

607
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:35,220
[INTERPRETER]

608
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,280
Now, if husband is a shouting person, the wife becomes deaf

609
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,900
[INTERPRETER]

610
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,960
but husband himself suffers from terrible coughing,

611
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,480
cold and all kinds of bronchial troubles

612
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:01,780
[INTERPRETER]

613
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:09,120
- and then he becomes vulnerable to the cancer also.
- [INTERPRETER]

614
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:17,360
Somehow, if he's triggered by this Protein 52 or 58, then he gets the throat cancer.

615
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:25,960
[INTERPRETER]

616
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:33,800
- [INTERPRETER]
- So he removes his gullet, he removes his nose, he removes his tongue - goes on removing one after another.

617
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:41,960
[INTERPRETER]

618
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,060
This is what is up to Vishuddhi chakra but Agnya is the most dangerous.

619
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:54,100
[INTERPRETER]

620
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:58,920
The masters of this black magic use their Agnya

621
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:05,780
- [INTERPRETER]
- through their eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

622
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,940
These people when they use their Agnya chakra that way

623
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:16,280
before death, they have to go through Hell as far as their body is concerned.

624
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:24,260
[INTERPRETER]

625
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:29,960
- They may develop all kinds of allergies
- [INTERPRETER]

626
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:34,220
or they may develop all kinds of

627
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:39,380
heating problems like blisters - their body will blister out.

628
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:46,980
- [INTERPRETER]
- Their head may burst out with heat.

629
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:53,940
- [INTERPRETER]
- They may have their brain damages, paralysis.

630
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,480
[INTERPRETER]

631
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,580
- This is only the physical side that happens
- [INTERPRETER]

632
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,520
but mentally also the people, who are right sided can become horrid.

633
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:16,100
[INTERPRETER]

634
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,620
- They become very aggressive.
- [INTERPRETER]

635
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:26,240
Like when they are possessed, you see, an idea can come into their heads that, "Let us become aggressive," you see,

636
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,940
fascist, they become fascist or they can become very right-sided people.

637
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:37,300
We can say, as we have in London nowadays they, they have shaven their hair and all that,

638
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:42,900
they have no marriages, nothing but they find anybody of a black color - they just strangle that person.

639
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:51,920
[INTERPRETER]

640
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:56,460
[INTERPRETER]

641
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:01,240
[INTERPRETER]

642
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,980
They aggress others, all the time they aggress by some sort of a funny doing.

643
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,600
[INTERPRETER]

644
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:19,380
[LAUGHTER]

645
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:24,440
- Very embarrassing!
- [LAUGHTER]

646
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,120
[LAUGHTER]

647
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,800
[LAUGHTER]

648
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,280
[LAUGHTER]

649
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:49,300
- At the right moment things happen, you know.
- [INTERPRETER]

650
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:09,080
- We were getting rather serious, so we needed something like that.
- [INTERPRETER]

651
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:17,440
So, as we see now, all these things happen to us when we try to go to the right.

652
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,500
As I said, when we aggress others, you see, now, when we start aggressing others, we destroy others.

653
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,760
[INTERPRETER]

654
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,820
[INTERPRETER]

655
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,860
- But we are part and parcel of the whole.
- [INTERPRETER]

656
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:46,160
If you destroy anything in that Whole, that the Whole thing then, you are destroying yourself as well.

657
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,660
[INTERPRETER]

658
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:56,520
So, we think that by aggressing others we are not harmed - you are very much harmed.

659
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:03,900
[INTERPRETER]

660
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,700
Whatever you give to others, goes round that person and comes back to you.

661
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,540
[INTERPRETER]

662
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:21,420
Now, a person who always says, "I hate you, I will kill you," all that,

663
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:26,100
may die with a very harsh hands himself.

664
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:31,220
[INTERPRETER]

665
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,640
[INTERPRETER]

666
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:41,260
- Such a man is always hated - no one likes him.
- [INTERPRETER]

667
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,100
But the, on the subtler level what happens to you

668
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:50,200
is on this thing, that such people sometimes lose their voices completely - they can't talk

669
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:57,400
[INTERPRETER]

670
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:05,780
- and could be that they, they  can not ascend at all.
- [INTERPRETER]

671
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:14,120
In the brain, as you can cut the  brain you can see in the transverse section of the brain, it looks like many petals.

672
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:21,420
[INTERPRETER]

673
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:28,180
That is what is called as Sahastrara because there are 1000 nerves according to sahaja yog.

674
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:34,680
Doctors will fight because they say that there are only 998 because they couldn't count two more.

675
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:41,360
[INTERPRETER]

676
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:48,860
[INTERPRETER]

677
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:55,900
Now, these nerves within us, these nerves within us, give us a brain

678
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,800
which is not being used; We have used very little part of our brain so far.

679
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:09,680
[INTERPRETER]

680
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,580
There are so many deeper sides in our brain which we have never used.

681
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:19,080
[INTERPRETER]

682
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:26,200
So, if we have to make an experiment, we must ascend and go to our Sahastrara, inside here

683
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:32,660
[INTERPRETER]

684
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:38,460
and you'll be surprised, that when people achieve this breaking of the Sahastrara,

685
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:43,520
they become one with the All-Pervading Divine ether

686
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:52,020
[INTERPRETER]

687
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,560
and they develop a new awareness, a new dimension on their Central Nervous System

688
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,060
that they can feel others, they can feel themselves.

689
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:10,420
[INTERPRETER]

690
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:16,320
- This is the minimum.
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then, when you raise the Kundalini of others, which you can do,

691
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:20,600
you put them in the center and solve all their problems of the sides.

692
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:27,760
[INTERPRETER]

693
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,400
[INTERPRETER]

694
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:40,600
- Many mad people have been cured through sahaja yog - is a fact.
- [INTERPRETER]

695
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,440
People have dropped their habits, any kind of habits that they had, suddenly just like that overnight.

696
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:51,960
[INTERPRETER]

697
01:15:52,380 --> 01:16:00,380
You can't imagine how people have changed. If I tell you, it cannot be believe because it is impossible for you to believe

698
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:07,240
[INTERPRETER]

699
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,980
but when you see for yourself this is happening, you are amazed.

700
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:19,980
How this Kundalini rising solves all our problems because we are neither on the right or on the left but we are above ourselves.

701
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:25,540
[INTERPRETER]

702
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,740
[INTERPRETER]

703
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:37,380
I'll give you an analogy to understand it because you all are fond of motor-cars - it will be easy to explain.

704
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:45,340
[INTERPRETER]

705
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,680
In every car we have got a accelerator, that is the right side

706
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:55,460
and the and the break on the left side which stops it - we need both.

707
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,180
[INTERPRETER]

708
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:05,280
[INTERPRETER]

709
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:11,220
Now when we are practicing driving, we, what we do, is to practice the left and the right

710
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:19,000
both of them and then when we learn it, we learn it. When do we learn - when we learn it.

711
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:25,440
[INTERPRETER]

712
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,220
[INTERPRETER]

713
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:36,240
Alright. So, when we learn driving, what do we know? We know how to use the left and the right.

714
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:43,020
[INTERPRETER]

715
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:49,440
So, you become a driver; We can say, you become a balanced personality - what we call it, dharmik.

716
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:56,180
[INTERPRETER]

717
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,740
But supposing, you use only the break, the car will not move

718
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:06,360
or if you use only the accelerator - you'll know what will happen to you.

719
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:12,280
[INTERPRETER]

720
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,840
[INTERPRETER]

721
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:23,160
- But still you are a driver
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the master is sitting at the back.
- [INTERPRETER]

722
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:30,580
- When you get your realization, you become the master.
- [INTERPRETER]

723
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,980
Then you start seeing the driver in you and the left in you and the right in you.

724
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:42,920
[INTERPRETER]

725
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,760
and to achieve that we have the central path through which you ascend.

726
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,240
[INTERPRETER]

727
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:58,820
This is the path which is established through our ascent

728
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:04,120
in our previous evolutionary process.

729
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:12,020
[INTERPRETER]

730
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:18,520
For example, this red thing that you see here - Mooladhara - was Carbon when we were Carbon.

731
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,260
[INTERPRETER]

732
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:27,620
[INTERPRETER]

733
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,060
- Now, the central path represents the Nitrogen,

734
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,700
[INTERPRETER]

735
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,740
left side the Hydrogen and the right side the Oxygen.

736
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,100
[INTERPRETER]

737
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,480
[INTERPRETER]

738
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:55,220
Now, when the Carbon combine with the Nitrogen, it

739
01:19:55,420 --> 01:20:00,500
it became amino acids and we became alive and ascent started.

740
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:07,040
[INTERPRETER]

741
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,180
[INTERPRETER]

742
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:16,840
Now, if you consider this as the body of the whole and we are part and parcel of it

743
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:23,060
then you consider that the evolution has taken place from this to that stage one by one

744
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:29,000
where all those leaders, who were there, are represented on the centers.

745
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:36,660
[INTERPRETER]

746
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:43,420
[INTERPRETER]

747
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:48,680
[INTERPRETER]

748
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:55,000
As human-beings are made in the image of the great Primordial being, you can see here, the center green

749
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:00,580
is represents in the, what we call, as Bhavasagara - the Great Ocean.

750
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:07,880
[INTERPRETER]

751
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:14,240
[INTERPRETER]

752
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:22,480
and this Great Ocean is the one where the fishes came up through amoeba stage

753
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:30,400
and then the fishes crossed over and then, gradually,  how all the animal kingdom came up. Like that, all these

754
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:37,200
deities, that we think of, are the leaders, are the leaders of the centers which they occupy.

755
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,080
[INTERPRETER]

756
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,320
[INTERPRETER]

757
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:53,780
[INTERPRETER]

758
01:21:53,960 --> 01:22:01,000
- So, we can say, that Christ came at this point.
- [INTERPRETER]

759
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:08,620
He was an Incarnation which was made of, we can say, the,

760
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:14,600
I get sometimes confused with the English language.

761
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:21,260
uh.. we can say, with the All-Pervading Power, with the Onkara itself.

762
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:28,620
[INTERPRETER]

763
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:36,160
- There was no element of Earth in Him,
- [INTERPRETER]

764
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,400
so He could walk on the water and He could resurrect Himself through this center

765
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:48,040
[INTERPRETER]

766
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:51,840
and that's why it is said that He's the gate - through Him you have to pass.

767
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,840
[INTERPRETER]

768
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:01,180
By doing that, it is, the optic chiasma,

769
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,620
in the center of that it is - it is controlling Pitutary and Pineal body.

770
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:10,200
[INTERPRETER]

771
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:14,340
[INTERPRETER]

772
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,900
Now, when the Kundalini rises and She awakens Christ there, He sucks in

773
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:24,340
these two things which are created by left and right side - one is the ego on the,

774
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,560
on that yellow side and the superego on the left hand side.

775
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:33,120
[INTERPRETER]

776
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,460
[INTERPRETER]

777
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:44,740
So, these ego and superego form this kind of a shell for us and we become like a egg, we can say.

778
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:52,560
[INTERPRETER]

779
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:57,140
Sometimes they overlap and then we become very hard shell

780
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:03,920
[INTERPRETER]

781
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,060
and we become, what we call, we develop our I-ness.

782
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,420
[INTERPRETER]

783
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:18,160
When the Kundalini passes through this Agnya Chakra, then She sucks in, He sucks in

784
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:24,440
Christ sucks in the left and the right - the conditioning and the karmas and the whole thing goes inside, like that

785
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,900
[INTERPRETER]

786
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,940
[INTERPRETER]

787
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:42,020
and over the limbic area, with the fontanel bone area, you find like a small child you develop a soft bone again.

788
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:48,820
[INTERPRETER]

789
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,020
- This is your re-birth.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In Sanskrit language

790
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:59,120
a bird is called as a dwijah - means born twice

791
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:05,060
and a brahmin, the one who knows the Brahma - the All-Pervading Power, is also called as dwijaha.

792
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,660
[INTERPRETER]

793
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,280
[INTERPRETER]

794
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:23,780
Brahmins, means the one who has known the Brahma - the one who's a realized soul - but nowadays we have all kinds of Brahmins in India.

795
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:28,480
[INTERPRETER]

796
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:34,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Mostly they are cooks

797
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,340
- [INTERPRETER]
- or they sit in the temple and sell ganja on things like that.

798
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Horrid!

799
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,880
Alright, so now, when, when the Kundalini sucks in and this opens out,

800
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:56,920
you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area on top of your head

801
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:04,880
[INTERPRETER]

802
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:10,100
because on top of your head is the place of the

803
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,520
God Almighty, as we call it, or you call Him Sadashiva or whatever name it may be

804
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:22,320
[INTERPRETER]

805
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,620
and His power is the Primordial Mother, Adishakti - the Holy Ghost

806
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:35,200
[INTERPRETER]

807
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:40,540
- and Onkara is the Son 
- [INTERPRETER]
- is Their Power.

808
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:47,620
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, it is impossible to understand that you have a Father, Who is a God

809
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:55,140
you have a God as a Son and no Mother - missing - Holy Ghost, how can you have that?

810
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:03,040
[INTERPRETER]

811
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:08,740
Have you seen such a situation? A father giving birth to a son - I have not seen so far.

812
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:13,880
[INTERPRETER]

813
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:20,520
- So there has to be a Mother, the female.
- [INTERPRETER]

814
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,940
That's the Primordial Mother and She's represented within us as Kundalini

815
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:30,680
and God Almighty represented within us as the Spirit in our heart.

816
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:39,100
[INTERPRETER]

817
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:46,320
This knowledge is very vast. You have to enter into the ocean of this knowledge and you'll become that.

818
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:54,300
[INTERPRETER]

819
01:27:54,540 --> 01:28:01,560
- You become the knowledge,
- [INTERPRETER]
- you become the joy,
- [INTERPRETER]

820
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:09,240
- you become the attention - 
- [INTERPRETER]
- that you have to become.
- [INTERPRETER]

821
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:15,200
- That's what you are - you are fantastic.
- [INTERPRETER]

822
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:22,040
Only thing, this has to be connected to the mains and the same way, you have to be connected to the mains - that's all; You're all ready for it.

823
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,840
[INTERPRETER]

824
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:32,100
[INTERPRETER]

825
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:37,400
So, do not have any guilt about it. Know that you're human-beings, specially created.

826
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:44,620
[INTERPRETER]

827
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:48,620
Only thing you have to enter into the Kingdom of God - that's all -

828
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:54,500
[INTERPRETER]

829
01:28:54,720 --> 01:29:00,640
and your Mother Kundalini, your individual Mother Kundalini is just waiting there to take you down.

830
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:04,340
- [INTERPRETER]
- to take you up, I should say.

831
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,860
[INTERPRETER]

832
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,540
[INTERPRETER]

833
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:19,080
After all, He is God Almighty Who's your Father - He's a Divine Father

834
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,960
and how can He ask you to suffer?

835
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:32,060
[INTERPRETER]

836
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:39,720
He's the most loving Father, He's love personified - how can He make you suffer?

837
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:46,280
- [INTERPRETER]
- We suffer out of our ignorance - sorry.

838
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:51,580
[INTERPRETER]

839
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:59,560
When the light comes in, you will see how gracious, kind and benevolent He is.

840
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:06,780
[INTERPRETER]

841
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:13,680
- Whether you believe in Him or not, He is.
- [INTERPRETER]

842
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:21,060
- You have to just enter into His Kingdom to see.
- [INTERPRETER]

843
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:25,600
So, there is no need to deny Him or accept Him but see for yourself.

844
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,740
[INTERPRETER]

845
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,220
- May God bless you!
- [INTERPRETER]

846
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:49,140
Now, I would request, like yesterday some people were

847
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:54,180
not wanting to have Self-realization, I would request them that they should leave us in peace.

848
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:01,120
[INTERPRETER]

849
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:05,580
[INTERPRETER]

850
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:12,300
It will hardly take 10-15 minutes for you to get realization but please don't disturb us.

851
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,640
If you want to go, you can go now and don't disturb others.

852
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:21,380
Better be a kind and civil to people who want to have their realization.

853
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:29,180
[INTERPRETER]

854
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:33,900
[INTERPRETER]

855
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:40,800
The experience is very simple and you can really feel it, you don't have to do anything about it.

856
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:44,880
[INTERPRETER]

857
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:49,440
[INTERPRETER]

858
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:09,640
Sahaja yogis should not disturb. If you're sahaja yogis, you be seated - doesn't matter. You need not get up and walk off

859
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,800
because no use disturbing people - it's not proper also.

860
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:22,020
- Let the sahaja yogis be seated wherever they are
- [INTERPRETER]

861
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:27,500
because these are new people and they easily, they get easily disturbed.

862
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,780
[INTERPRETER]

863
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,820
- So, one must keep the silence, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

864
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:47,960
I had asked you to give Me questions and no questions have come through

865
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:54,560
but even now, if you have some questions, you may pass them over to our center and I would like to answer them.

866
01:32:55,400 --> 01:33:01,180
After this realization I have to make a very great respect,

867
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:09,460
respectful request to you, that you must have respect for your realization.

868
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:16,060
[INTERPRETER]

869
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:22,640
[INTERPRETER]

870
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:28,160
You have to be profound and deep to understand everything but

871
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,960
it gives you depth, suddenly you become deeper personality, immediately.

872
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:40,560
[INTERPRETER]

873
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:45,700
Nothing is wanted out of you. If you are a human-being, you'll get your realization.

874
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:52,900
[INTERPRETER]

875
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,820
Maybe, some may not get today because they might be

876
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:01,980
not yet tuned or maybe but doesn't matter, you will always get it.

877
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:10,160
[INTERPRETER]

878
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:20,440
Now, as I've told you, you have to have your shoes taken out because we have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

879
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:28,840
[INTERPRETER]

880
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:52,660
I think, you send him away - would be better - go off to sleep.

881
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:59,720
That's better. Take him away because he will go off to sleep in no time - must be tired.

882
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:09,060
All the children can go away now. Let it be. They are all realized souls. They should not be bothered much.

883
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:13,380
They want to sit they can sit down but it's time for them - it's about 90'clock.

884
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:24,680
Alright, so now, is very simple that I will tell you beforehand what is to be done -

885
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:32,520
is to put left hand towards Me because is the desire that you have and the right hand you should use for action.

886
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:40,160
[INTERPRETER]

887
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:45,940
[INTERPRETER]

888
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:51,220
I will show you only and you can see for yourself also. First your heart you have to touch

889
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:58,700
- [INTERPRETER]
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

890
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:05,860
Then everything works on the left hand side. You have to put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side

891
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:09,340
where there is the center of your mastery - is the Nabhi chakra.

892
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:17,140
[INTERPRETER]

893
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:21,860
[INTERPRETER]

894
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:27,980
Then, you have to take your right hand and push it into the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side

895
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:34,320
where is the center of Swadhishtana is, through which we work out the laws of the Divine.

896
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,740
[INTERPRETER]

897
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:44,880
[INTERPRETER]

898
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:50,620
Then you have to raise your right hand again. At this point the Kundalini starts moving

899
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:55,320
so you have to raise your hand again on the chakra

900
01:36:55,440 --> 01:37:01,080
which is the Nabhi chakra on the left hand side on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

901
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:07,440
[INTERPRETER]

902
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:11,760
[INTERPRETER]

903
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:20,100
- Now, again you have to bring your hand on to the heart chakra.
- [INTERPRETER]

904
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:26,920
Now, here is the left Vishudhhi, which is caught up when we feel guilty - that's a very bad state.

905
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:32,500
[INTERPRETER]

906
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:38,060
Put the hand across like this - not from the back, it's very bad. I tell you, it's the worst chakra today.

907
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:46,560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Yesterday... not to feel guilty at all. I request you not to feel guilty, not to feel guilty - please.

908
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:53,520
[INTERPRETER]

909
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:59,000
- Be pleasantly placed towards you.
- [INTERPRETER]

910
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:03,200
You are the temple of God. Believe Me, you are the temple of God

911
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,140
[INTERPRETER]

912
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:14,520
- and turn your head to the right and hold it tight like that.
-  [INTERPRETER]

913
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:20,400
Now, then you have to take your right hand put it on your forehead. Press it on both the sides.

914
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:27,480
[INTERPRETER]

915
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:33,520
Now, you have to take your right hand. Put it back on your

916
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:39,600
back Agnya, which is on the, we can say, on the optic lobe and push back your head like this.

917
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:47,500
[INTERPRETER]

918
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:52,380
- Now, you have to stretch your hand fully.
- [INTERPRETER]

919
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:59,340
Stretch fully. Now, put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

920
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,580
Press it very hard and move it seven times.

921
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:07,680
[INTERPRETER]

922
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,640
[INTERPRETER]

923
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,620
- [INTERPRETER]
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]

924
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:23,620
But before we start today, we better give us ourselves a balance a little bit.

925
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:29,120
[INTERPRETER]

926
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:34,560
- Please put your left hand towards Me, like this for ...
- [INTERPRETER]

927
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:41,840
Now, what you have to do, your right side is too much working, so, we have to give a balance to ourselves.

928
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:47,380
You put your right hand just like this and take it up on your head

929
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:51,220
and put it on the side like that and throw it away.

930
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:59,380
[INTERPRETER]

931
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,920
- We'll do it three times to begin with. Let us start.
- [INTERPRETER]

932
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,640
On top of your head, on top of your head, nicely - push it down. Again,

933
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,980
throw it down. Again, take it on top of of your head, nicely.

934
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:20,620
Throw it down. Again

935
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:29,960
- and throw it down. Now, it's a balance.
- [INTERPRETER]

936
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:37,360
Now, let us start with the left hand towards Me, like this - this is the desire, this is the action and close your eyes now.

937
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:43,520
[INTERPRETER]

938
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:50,820
Please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Slowly, like that, not at a stretch - just like this, just like this. It's alright - anyway.

939
01:40:53,060 --> 01:41:00,920
You will stretch your hand too much, madam. Just put it like... very relaxed. You'll be tired - yes, just in a comfortable way.

940
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:08,380
- Alright, yeah. Now, put your right hand on your heart, please.
-  [INTERPRETER]

941
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:14,660
You may take out your spectacles because you have to keep your eyes shut all the time and it helps the eyesight also.

942
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:22,100
[INTERPRETER]

943
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:27,260
Alright, now, close your eyes, please. Don't open them till I tell you.

944
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,240
[INTERPRETER]

945
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:39,140
Now, now on the heart you put your right hand and you have to say

946
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,040
or you have to ask a question, a very fundamental question.

947
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
You can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother - whatever suits you -

948
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:55,260
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask the question three times.

949
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:02,120
[INTERPRETER]

950
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,040
- Three times, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

951
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:25,220
This fundamental question is followed by another because if you are the Spirit, you are your master too.

952
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:32,720
[INTERPRETER]

953
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,840
Now, so, you put your right hand now on the upper portion

954
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,660
of your abdomen, without opening your eyes, on the left hand side.

955
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:51,800
[INTERPRETER]

956
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:57,960
Now here, you have to ask the second question.

957
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:04,020
This is the center of mastery, so you have to ask a question, another question,

958
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:09,140
"Mother, am I my own master?" ask this question three times.

959
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:16,260
[INTERPRETER]

960
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:20,600
[INTERPRETER]

961
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:36,060
Now, after asking this question, you have to take down your right hand in the lower

962
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:44,360
part of your abdomen on the left hand side and here is the center of true knowledge, of Pure Knowledge.

963
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:49,420
[INTERPRETER]

964
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:54,280
[INTERPRETER]

965
01:43:54,740 --> 01:44:00,700
Here, we cannot force you to ask this question

966
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:05,120
[INTERPRETER]

967
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:12,420
so, you have to ask yourself in all your freedom, which I respect.

968
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,580
[INTERPRETER]

969
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:22,680
[Let it be, doesn't matter. Leave her alone.]

970
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:28,540
You have to ask the question, here, by saying

971
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:37,240
or you have to ask or you have to ask  for My help by saying, "Mother, may I have the Pure Knowledge."

972
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:45,220
[INTERPRETER]

973
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:54,180
- Please ask the question six times
- [INTERPRETER]

974
01:44:55,220 --> 01:45:02,520
- You have to ask for it, I cannot force you.
- [INTERPRETER]

975
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,980
Now, raise your right hand

976
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:28,440
- to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side
- [INTERPRETER]

977
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:36,160
- on your abdomen
- [INTERPRETER]
- Please don't open your eyes, please don't open your eyes.
-  [INTERPRETER]

978
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:42,920
Alright, now here, as the Kundalini has started moving,

979
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:50,240
you have to open this chakra, by saying with full confidence

980
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:58,060
because this is the master's chakra, "Mother, I am my own master."

981
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:05,000
[INTERPRETER]

982
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,260
[INTERPRETER]

983
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:36,120
Ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

984
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:40,140
[INTERPRETER]

985
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:58,500
Now, with full confidence, again you put your right hand on your heart,

986
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:04,280
-  [INTERPRETER]
- on your heart.
-  [INTERPRETER]

987
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:11,880
Here now, with full confidence, you have to say again,

988
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:16,640
"Mother, I am my own

989
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:21,540
Spirit," or you can say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

990
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:29,260
[INTERPRETER]

991
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:36,880
- Please say it twelve times,
-  [INTERPRETER]

992
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:45,220
- with full confidence - this is the greatest Truth.
-  [INTERPRETER]

993
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,320
- Twelve times
- [INTERPRETER]

994
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:07,900
Now, please raise your right hand on the left hand side of corner

995
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:15,380
between you neck and your shoulder and press it hard and move your neck to the right side.

996
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:21,400
[INTERPRETER]

997
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,920
[INTERPRETER]

998
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:31,180
Now here, with full confidence, again you have to say,

999
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:34,720
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

1000
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:41,900
[INTERPRETER]

1001
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:48,940
Even after saying that, you want to feel guilty, you better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

1002
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:53,480
[INTERPRETER]

1003
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:58,540
[INTERPRETER]

1004
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:06,740
- You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

1005
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,000
- Alright, that's good!
- [INTERPRETER]

1006
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:24,240
Now, raise your right hand and put it to your forehead across.

1007
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:28,160
[INTERPRETER]

1008
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:34,320
- Now here you press it on both the sides
- [INTERPRETER]

1009
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:37,720
and here you have to say,

1010
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:45,120
from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

1011
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:49,840
[INTERPRETER]

1012
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:54,880
[INTERPRETER]
