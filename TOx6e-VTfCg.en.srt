1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,759
I thank Mr. Emro

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,960
for inviting Me to such a unique type of gathering.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,439
The subject is very interesting

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,840
that how Sahaja Yoga can help beauty.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,079
Now Sahaja Yoga, as you know, here it is shown

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,159
that there is a power in your triangular bone, here, as you see.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,080
And this is in every human being - every.

8
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:01,800
And this power, has to be awakened.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,960
Then it passes through these six centers.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,276
The seventh one low below there, the number one,

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,192
and

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,013
pierces through your fontanel bone area

13
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:20,484
and connects you to the Divine.

14
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,959
As a result of that,

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,963
all these centers who are responsible, they are responsible

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,039
for our physical, mental, emotional

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,199
and also spiritual being,

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,021
all of them are enlightened and integrated.

19
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:45,159
It, this power is in everyone but

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,639
to talk about it, people don't believe in it.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,079
You must have the experience of it.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,719
And once you have the experience, you'll be amazed,

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,359
how many things happen to you

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,119
which you cannot even imagine.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,759
It's very kind of him to have called me here, that way

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,519
I've met many people of that kind

27
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,839
but nobody has tried to invite others

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,733
who could share this experience.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,040
Now coming to the point of beauty,

30
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,729
I must tell you the Divine is the most beautiful thing,

31
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,159
because it creates all beautiful things.

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,080
You see in the nature, every leaf is different from another.

33
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:38,073
Such a variety. Also, if you see,

34
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:42,998
all leaves are so arranged that they all get sunshine.

35
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,800
Such a consideration, such an understanding.

36
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:53,825
In the same way, when Divine works in you,

37
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:58,159
you also have that capacity

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,877
to share it with others, understand with others

39
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:06,079
and to be part and parcel of the whole.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,433
Not just yourself, single person (everything).

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,289
Now, one thing

42
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,600
is there that people are now conscious of their beauty.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
But perhaps they don't know, how do we spoil our beauty.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,720
First, let us see, how our beauty spoils.

45
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:39,586
It is spoiled sometimes,

46
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,720
showing lots of wrinkles on the face.

47
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:50,012
Now, I am 77 years of age. I'll be 78 very soon.

48
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:54,149
And I am grand-grandmother. I don't have wrinkles.

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,404
Nor my daughters have.

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,901
The reason is this,

51
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:08,720
that normally human beings specially ladies, react very much,

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,835
react to everything.

53
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:15,959
Whatever happens in their life, they react,

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,701
whatever happens in others lives they react,

55
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:27,440
whatever is happening on the other planes, they react.

56
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,593
By reacting, you do not get to anything.

57
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:34,605
You do not achieve anything.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,079
So, the first thing,

59
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,120
I would say that when it happens, you don't react.

60
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,616
You just watch, you become a witness.

61
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:49,723
You become the witness of the whole thing.

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,650
And when these things happen, then the creativity

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
starts coming from somewhere unknown,

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,636
and you are amazed how you can create things

65
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,999
without reading any book, without taking any help,

66
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,306
and suddenly you become very, very creative.

67
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:17,039
I've seen in Sahaja yoga, how people have achieved

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,990
great heights in creativity,

69
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,039
in sports, in everything

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
because they get this energy, divine energy within them.

71
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:32,289
So, they also understand,

72
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:39,513
that they have to be more patient,

73
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:45,200
more loving, more caring towards themselves and towards others also.

74
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:49,719
Once that happens -

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,069
I've seen this one is so beautifully done -

76
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,200
is that you start caring for people.

77
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,431
You start caring for your customers, understanding them,

78
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,039
plus your creativity.

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,039
You do not borrow ideas from others,

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,359
you don't learn by your own mad thinking,

81
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,960
but you actually become creative

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,919
under the influence of the Divine.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,920
And when the Divine starts working, it's perfect.

84
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,090
Perfection.

85
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,319
There's no competition.

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,060
You create not out of competition, but just to create.

87
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:35,699
Freely. There's no compulsion.

88
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,876
And when you start creating, you are amazed at yourself,

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,759
how can you create all these things

90
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,120
with whatever knowledge you have, whatever experience you have?

91
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,439
All these things happen.

92
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,008
I'm happy it has happened in the case of Mr. Emro

93
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:00,960
and that he has taken that he should pass this to you people.

94
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,869
Now in modern times,

95
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,142
fashion has become very popular.

96
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,432
So it's alright. But the fashion that you (use)

97
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:20,968
how far it is helpful

98
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,737
to you in your health, that you should see to it.

99
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:28,040
Now if I reveal certain things, you should not be shocked

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,102
and should be unhappy about.

101
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:34,880
All these centers are

102
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:40,495
expressed in our different parts of the body.

103
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:44,104
For example, this green one that you see.

104
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:49,200
It's here in the Nabhi, is expressed on these two knees.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,799
Very important - two knees are very important.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,432
So, if you want to keep your knees

107
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,960
in perfect health, I would say

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,439
one should not expose the knees.

109
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,439
If you expose the knees, everybody sees that.

110
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,283
And there are lots of negative forces around.

111
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:12,973
What's the use of exposing the knee? I don't understand.

112
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:16,280
About twenty years back, nobody used to do that.

113
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,680
But now suddenly the fashion has started,

114
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,412
that you expose your knees.

115
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:26,577
And exposure of knees, you will end up with very bad knees,

116
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:30,717
you won't be able to even walk. At My age -  you may not reach also.

117
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,073
So it has to be covered.

118
00:08:35,274 --> 00:08:38,473
Now if you wear a covered knee thing in England,

119
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,520
or anywhere in the west,

120
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,555
they'll ask you, "Are you Turkish?"

121
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,759
Now, because in Turkey they know this.

122
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Turkish people are still traditional -

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,035
they know, they will not expose their knees.

124
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,246
And exposure of knees is very dangerous.

125
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:03,468
This is a very, very important chakra - we call as a Nabhi chakra.

126
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:08,599
It is related to our

127
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,319
Lakshmi tatwa also - Lakshmi means the goddess of money.

128
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,120
It is expressed in so many ways within us:

129
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,559
our digestion, everything.

130
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,399
Apart from that, the main thing is,

131
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,440
it gives a very different expression to your body.

132
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:33,718
Supposing there's somebody who is very greedy -

133
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,347
you can make out from the face.

134
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:42,189
Somebody who is very jealous - you can make out, from the face.

135
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,075
Somebody who is very cunning - you can make out from the face.

136
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:53,548
In the same way, when you have this first center

137
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:56,559
it's very, very important,

138
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,622
which is too much, maybe, to tell you, but it's very important.

139
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,612
This is the center of your innocence.

140
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:12,159
This innocence is there, always.

141
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,774
It cannot be destroyed, it is indestructible.

142
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:19,520
Whatever you may do, whatever wrong you may commit,

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,892
whatever immoral thing you may do, this center is there

144
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,479
and innocence is there.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,174
It might be covered with some clouds - it's different -

146
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,511
but nobody can destroy this center.

147
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,999
Now the face that is innocent,

148
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,640
is always very beautiful. You see the children,

149
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,239
what love you have for children, because they have innocent faces.

150
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,052
This center has to be looked after.

151
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:47,266
And this center

152
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:51,504
gets distorted and spoiled

153
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:55,520
while, not that you become cunning and all that,

154
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,350
but it gets spoilt when you don't respect your chastity.

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,987
That's a very important thing. You may do whatever fashion you like,

156
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:08,240
but your chastity is very important - that's your power.

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,080
If you respect your chastity, nobody can destroy you.

158
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:16,199
That's the greatest boon

159
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,360
human beings have, whether they are men or women.

160
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,959
Chastity is very important and this center

161
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,450
will start showing its results.

162
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:34,169
With innocence, your face becomes very innocent

163
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,720
and loving, lovable, like that of children.

164
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,400
Cunningness, you can see on the face. At least, I can see.

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,527
You can understand persons being exploiting you,

166
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:54,191
making use of you.

167
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,900
But if this center is alright,

168
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:01,003
then you're so powerful.

169
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:07,292
You're so powerful, that nobody can destroy your innocence.

170
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,960
And that is to be respected very much for the beauty.

171
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,084
I think I have seen women

172
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,560
who are every beautiful, have innocence in them.

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,219
They may not be sexually attractive and all that,

174
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,080
but the face is so innocent

175
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,201
so innocent, lovable!

176
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:30,576
Whatever may be your age, is not the point,

177
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,448
but you respect yourself.

178
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,731
First of all, if you don't respect yourself,

179
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:37,365
who is going to respect you?

180
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,056
Then another thing is that, the second chakra is

181
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:45,400
above that, the green one, is this red chakra.

182
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,707
This is for your heart. We call it the center heart.

183
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,119
When you are insecure, then this thing catches.

184
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,605
And this chakra has got a quality

185
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,360
by which it produces angels.

186
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,184
You can call them as anything - they call them antibodies.

187
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,479
These angels are created for your protection.

188
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,189
For everything. If you have any disease they'll fight it,

189
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,159
if you have any problems, they will fight it.

190
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,319
If you have any fear -

191
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,330
say suddenly you see a dog, tiger or something -

192
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:25,559
this center will start pulsating like that.

193
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,063
And this pulsation creates

194
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,719
a kind of a motion among these people whom I call angels.

195
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,097
And these angels know that there's a danger

196
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,639
and they try to protect you.

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,028
So this center is very important.

198
00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:47,119
You must have security.

199
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,758
Your sense of security is disturbed,

200
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,383
when this center goes into jeopardy.

201
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,954
It is...

202
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,348
Modern times is full of insecurities.

203
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:03,179
Especially for ladies - full of insecurities.

204
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,629
They're always feeling, "God knows what's going to happen to me,

205
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,679
what is going to be against me".

206
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,598
All this is on this center, it depends.

207
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,947
This is the Mother's center.

208
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:24,839
And if you understood the meaning of your mother's heart,

209
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,243
or your heart as a mother,

210
00:14:27,444 --> 00:14:32,243
you have understood that part, then this center settles down,

211
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:33,960
you feel secured.

212
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,300
You have to be absolutely secure within yourself.

213
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,839
This is a very important point.

214
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,720
These days I find women are having so many breast cancers and all that.

215
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:48,998
That is also due to this center.

216
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:54,386
Why? Because if the husband is very dominating,

217
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:59,400
and very exacting, then women develop this.

218
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:04,033
And in America, you'll be amazed, in a place where women are

219
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:07,960
so well placed, so many women have this trouble.

220
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,153
I couldn't explain. I couldn't understand.

221
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:15,769
While in Indian women don't have.

222
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,809
Surprisingly. Because in India,

223
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,520
the children are the power of the mother.

224
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,971
Her power is not with anything else but with her children.

225
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:35,600
And she'll see to it that her children get proper education,

226
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,240
they are brought up well for anything,

227
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,133
that she has to sell her ornaments and sell everything,

228
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:45,524
but she would see that they are well educated.

229
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,160
And she will look after them first than anything else,

230
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,039
when she's a mother.

231
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,082
That doesn't mean that you give up your profession,

232
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,420
doesn't mean that you don't go out,

233
00:15:56,621 --> 00:16:00,705
but you have to put full attention to your children - very important.

234
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,879
I show the result of that is this today:

235
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,765
that all the software people are coming from India. Why?

236
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,081
Why not from England and why not from other countries,

237
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,839
who are supposed to be so developed?

238
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,598
When I came here, I was surprised so many of my disciples,

239
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,919
they were not worried about their studies.

240
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,485
They said: "We want to be (big), we want to be garbage cleaners.".

241
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:33,459
I said "Why?"

242
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,191
"Because you can get a lot of money in that way.

243
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,517
But what a student?

244
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,141
Even if you are a graduate you don't get much money."

245
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:44,092
I said, "You don't understand your dignity,

246
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,240
you don't understand you have to progress

247
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,120
in your thinking and understanding."

248
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,759
They said, "No, we want to do something where we can get money.

249
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,865
We can take to anything that can give us money."

250
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:56,637
"It will give you money", I said,

251
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:00,240
"but it will not give you education and concentration."

252
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,420
That is the main point you should have, is your concentration.

253
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,519
And this concentration if it doesn't come,

254
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,121
then you cannot work out anything.

255
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,560
Thank God, I told them, "You better take to some education."

256
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,600
They all got admissions into good colleges, schools.

257
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,829
Now they're doing very well.

258
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,306
It's alright. You may earn later. Money is not everything.

259
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:28,609
You may earn little less but at least you have the education.

260
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,641
Now there's such a dearth of education in America,

261
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,043
among you people.

262
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:37,638
First of all, the education is extremely, extremely expensive

263
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,550
and those schools which are available otherwise are of no good.

264
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,965
So, what we find we can have better

265
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,519
carpenters, we can have better windows,

266
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,709
but no education.

267
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,633
So, people are pouring from India for software-ing

268
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:59,181
Because the concentration is gone.

269
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:04,637
So this concentration power comes from the mother, to the children,

270
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:08,407
and they have very concentrated mind.

271
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:12,791
It's very important to have that concentration

272
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:16,989
and the faith, as a mother.

273
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,520
So many people, why do they get

274
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,411
ladies, specially get this breast cancer - I can't understand.

275
00:18:24,612 --> 00:18:28,187
Because they are insecure. A husband cannot make you insecure,

276
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:33,438
if you have children and if your children are to your support.

277
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:37,830
If you are even alone, you should have faith in your mother.

278
00:18:38,031 --> 00:18:41,159
Such mothers if there are, who will look after you,

279
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,399
who will always support you,

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,760
will give you that security which is very important

281
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,679
for these antibodies.

282
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,440
Even the cancer and all these diseases are caused by the lack of

283
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,239
antibodies within us.

284
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,639
So these antibodies are like little, little, we can call angels

285
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:04,040
which look after you, which worry about you.

286
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,296
This is the treasure you have within yourself

287
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,090
which should not be exploited.

288
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,280
Your security should not be allowed to challenge anyone.

289
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:15,120
This is, that's why I said,

290
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,464
it's a very, very important center is this one,

291
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:21,824
what you call, it's the heart chakra.

292
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:28,119
Now outside without Sahaja Yoga,

293
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,408
I don't know how one can achieve the stability of the heart.

294
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,235
Heart becomes weak because people lose tempers.

295
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,419
Those who are very hot tempered people,

296
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,960
they have problems on their heart.

297
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,235
And I have seen people they get a heart attack

298
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,839
and get it all kinds of heart problems

299
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,960
because of this chakra in danger - heart chakra.

300
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,570
So, insecurity on one side, and heart attacks on another side.

301
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,915
To get angry is very wrong.

302
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,760
To get angry is absolutely ruining yourself, it's self destructive.

303
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,520
But by telling it will not happen. You have to have Realization,

304
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,160
you must have Self Realization, by which

305
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,278
you become absolutely peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

306
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:31,337
Then the last chakra is this one, Vidshuddhi chakra is at the last.

307
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:35,079
This chakra, Vishuddhi, is here -

308
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,397
it's important. This gets spoiled by many things.

309
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:43,659
Supposing you use abusive words,

310
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,456
if you are aggressive with your tongue.

311
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:50,067
Like in America, they use very abusive words, I was surprised.

312
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,960
All the time they're using stupid words

313
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,249
which I don't even understand.

314
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,959
All that is causing this trouble.

315
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,033
And this can go up to any limit.

316
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:06,620
Because it controls 16 of your...

317
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:09,366
16 of your...

318
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,988
I should say, organs, right? It controls your eyes,

319
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,055
it controls your nose, it controls your tongue,

320
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:20,318
it controls your teeth, it controls your ears,

321
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,566
everything are controlled, 16 things are controlled

322
00:21:23,767 --> 00:21:26,365
by this Vishuddhi chakra.

323
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:30,444
And on the both sides we have the most important,

324
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:35,759
very great chakras, which we can call, it says they rule

325
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,375
ourselves and the whole world.

326
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,969
These are 2 chakras, on the sides.

327
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,895
And they are,

328
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,768
we call them as...

329
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,483
I don't need other Indian names,

330
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:55,159
but they are very important chakras, these two.

331
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,130
And when you expose them, then you have problems with these.

332
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,812
So they should not be exposed. You can have small sleeves.

333
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:07,884
But never expose them.

334
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:11,205
Then you can get any kind of problem, any kind of problem,

335
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,782
any kind of problem,

336
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,261
combined with this chakra.

337
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:20,652
I'm sorry, I have to warn you people.

338
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:24,065
Alright. But it's a fashion now.

339
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:28,960
What is the need to expose? To please men? Why should you care?

340
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:32,760
Why should you care for men so much?

341
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,815
I can't understand. Women are the shakti, they are the power.

342
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,581
Why should you try to please men?

343
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,003
So why have this kind of a

344
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:47,679
inferiority complex about yourself -

345
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,479
all the time trying to please men.

346
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,659
And they are very funny, I tell you.

347
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,135
What has killed romance is this.

348
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,280
See a man falls in love with say -

349
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,522
I'm sorry to say this - with our hair dress.

350
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,212
There's a hair dress, a particular hair dress,

351
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,160
so Mr. X falls in love with that hair dress.

352
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,444
But then she goes to hairdresser, changes her dress.

353
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,795
It's over, romance is over.

354
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,599
They're so superficial.

355
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,484
They're so superficial that they can fall for your hair dress.

356
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,186
And the women feel so disappointed

357
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:33,035
the way the men treat them and behave.

358
00:23:33,236 --> 00:23:36,353
So, I would suggest that

359
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,520
it's very important that you should not try to please men.

360
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:44,679
You be yourself, in your self esteem.

361
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,160
You are women, after all, and you have special qualities.

362
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,880
Stand in your own dignity. Stand in your own power.

363
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:58,920
And in this, when it happens, women get more power than men can get.

364
00:23:59,463 --> 00:24:05,560
It's very surprising. And it works out so beautifully for women.

365
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:10,504
And it should. Now, for example, you are

366
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,599
you are yourself hairdresser or anything you are,

367
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,564
you become so creative.

368
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:20,677
If you are a musician, you become very creative.

369
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,759
If you are anything, whatever profession you are following,

370
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,747
you become so very creative when this thing happens to you,

371
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:30,639
because all your centers are cleared out.

372
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,583
And the power of the Divine is pouring through you.

373
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:38,911
This is what you should achieve, that is what you should have,

374
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:42,013
then nobody can dominate you.

375
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:46,479
Not only that, it goes higher,

376
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,712
this is the most important chakra, which is called,

377
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:54,273
we call it Agnya chakra between the optic chiasma like this.

378
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,360
And if it is not open, it is very, very constricted

379
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,079
if it doesn't open then Kundalini won't pass through.

380
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,920
Now this is the chakra of Jesus Christ where we crucified Him.

381
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,098
Now what did he do, He first gave forgiveness

382
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,786
to all the people who tried to torture Him, and crucified Him.

383
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:18,767
So only the way you forgive people, it opens out.

384
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,589
You have to forgive. No use to remember him.

385
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,260
Somebody has hurt you, alright. So what?

386
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:30,679
It's finished. It's not today. Whatever has happened has happened.

387
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,450
Why worry about it?

388
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:35,196
But if you don't forgive, then all the time

389
00:25:35,397 --> 00:25:38,439
you'll be thinking about it and will be torturing yourself

390
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,159
for nothing at all. Instead of that you just forgive.

391
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,858
Forgive everything. Forgiving is a very great quality

392
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,707
by which nobody can torture you, nobody can trouble you,

393
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:52,239
because you do not pay any attention to.

394
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,423
You don't know people are trying to trouble Me so much

395
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:02,640
so much they have done to make Me, sort of hurt, or do all kinds of things.

396
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:06,664
But somehow, I forgive them. And I am finished.

397
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,650
Because once you forgive them,

398
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:11,028
you don't remember what they have done to you,

399
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,079
and you never torture yourself.

400
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,080
But if you don't forgive, then you torture yourself

401
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,320
thinking, "Why did he do this? Why did she do this?"

402
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,580
Nothing - you just forgive.

403
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,320
The very great present of Jesus - that you should forgive everyone.

404
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,586
That gives you a great peace here.

405
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:36,339
But this peace also is very important.

406
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,616
If you don't have peace within you,

407
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:42,199
then you start becoming old very soon.

408
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,839
I have seen many young girls having wrinkles, worried, upset,

409
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,960
tension, this that, all the time irritated.

410
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,439
The reason is that they have not yet forgiven

411
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,585
those people who have troubled them.

412
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:02,711
So if you can develop this witness state, as I said,

413
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,439
you are not bothered.

414
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,270
You just witness the whole thing,

415
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,697
and you'll be amazed that this center will be opened,

416
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:14,038
and by that you will not react.

417
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,945
You will not react. You'll just see, "Alright.

418
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:19,439
This is so, so this is so."

419
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,191
And the life becomes full of humor

420
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,523
and anything absurd you see, just smile and laugh.

421
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:30,350
There's no time for you to think about these nonsensical things

422
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:36,290
that people say about you, or try to harm you, or try to

423
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:39,594
create a problem. You shouldn't worry.

424
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:43,730
You shouldn't worry about that. Now they...

425
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,119
With this happening,

426
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,520
you don't try to think what others are thinking about you.

427
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:03,717
because you know, you are one with Divine,

428
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,519
because you get vibrations on your hands,

429
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,999
you are assured that you are alright, so you have confidence.

430
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,879
But you don't with this confidence, oppress others.

431
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,487
It is confidence with love.

432
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:21,159
I call it as the intelligence which is emotional.

433
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
I call it as emotional intelligence.

434
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,484
Many children are born with it,

435
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,199
but they are taught something else so they [do with it].

436
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,444
I'll say my own great grandson,

437
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:36,680
who is born with this, so as soon as we reached America,

438
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:39,600
he was with us for only six months, he was a little boy,

439
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,351
and after one, 7-8 months we went to America,

440
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,039
immediately he brought the remote control and gave it to my husband.

441
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,199
Because he is always seeing the television - immediately.

442
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,839
Then he brought newspaper and gave Me to read.

443
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,883
And to Me he brought a flower.

444
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,989
So, by his emotional intelligence

445
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,529
he knows what one likes, what one has.

446
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,243
If you come home or somebody visits us

447
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,759
he'll immediately bring the things to

448
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,116
give them to eat or to please them -

449
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,835
all the time, these things of entertaining.

450
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,879
He'll start dancing,

451
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,680
and he'll start showing you dance. Have you seen it?

452
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:27,925
He's so careful,

453
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:31,045
that he should express his love

454
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:35,405
and with animals, everyone, he's so friendly.

455
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,804
That is emotional intelligence we should develop.

456
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:41,359
And depend on it, it helps you.

457
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,585
You will get lots of friends, you will gets lots of

458
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:50,239
I should say, not only friends, but people who will help you

459
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,720
in your work. They'll give you a great assistance in everything.

460
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,004
It's a very, very great capacity to be emotionally intelligent.

461
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:08,480
People think if you are emotional then people take advantage of you.

462
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,874
Let them take. What's the harm?

463
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:16,265
But you do no take advantage of yourself

464
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:21,480
by being cruel or by being any way harsh to others.

465
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:25,097
Remember those days when somebody was sweet?

466
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:29,240
Remember that time, that moment when somebody was very sweet,

467
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,539
very nice to you, very kind, very helpful. Remember!

468
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,360
Remember all these moments, not the moments when you are insulted

469
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,005
not the time when you have suffered,

470
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,931
but the time when somebody has given you love,

471
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,249
somebody has talked to you with love,

472
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,600
and you'll be amazed such fragrance within you will start blowing.

473
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:56,280
So many people have got this Realization,

474
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,160
and they have forgotten all nonsense of fighting and all.

475
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,032
Now we have sometimes people,

476
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:05,928
thousands of them in India sometimes,

477
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:09,650
and I was surprised, they come from different countries,

478
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:12,846
and Sahaja Yoga is working in 86 countries,

479
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:14,799
and they never quarrel, they never fight.

480
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,688
I've never heard anybody quarreling or fighting.

481
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:21,840
Ha, they pull each others legs, they're very humorous.

482
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:26,960
That's they do. Now the another craze we have now in -

483
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,230
I don't know why - that we should be very, very thin,

484
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:35,225
that thinness is very attractive. It's not so.

485
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,439
See you become thin sometimes automatically

486
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,243
if your liver is out of order,

487
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:45,479
which is a very dangerous thing, to have a bad liver.

488
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,044
I agree, you should not be fat.

489
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:51,520
Also if you become fat very much you might develop something else.

490
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,520
But If you are naturally thin, then understand

491
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,447
that must be liver out of order.

492
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,983
Now this liver when it is out of order,

493
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:04,154
how many problems it can give, you don't know it.

494
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,669
First of all it can give asthma.

495
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,760
It can give you a...

496
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:18,417
if it moves on the right side, it can give you diabetes.

497
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:23,691
It can give you, this heat, if it moves downward here,

498
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:28,048
it can give you also the spleen into trouble

499
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:32,080
and that can ultimately give you a cancer,

500
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:34,960
blood cancer, it can give you blood cancer.

501
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,115
Then if it goes to the uterus, also it can harm you there.

502
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:43,239
If this heat from the liver goes on passing throughout

503
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,959
and creates problems all over. Not only that,

504
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,920
but also it can give you a massive heart attack after some time.

505
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:55,023
If you are young and if you are drinking too much and

506
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,973
playing tennis and all

507
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,903
then suddenly the heart goes off.

508
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,439
That is how many heart attacks come.

509
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,159
So to preserve your health within yourself,

510
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,760
first you should know what you are, what problems you have,

511
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,602
why these problems are there.

512
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:14,840
And then also you should know why there are problems outside.

513
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,057
This is very simple to understand if you become divine.

514
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:23,600
This divine light can give you all the understanding of everything.

515
00:33:25,686 --> 00:33:28,043
I don't know, I've spoken about it so many times

516
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:30,720
but never relating to beauty as such.

517
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,688
But

518
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:37,967
beauty is of course, is within, you know?

519
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,691
It's all within, it's not without.

520
00:33:40,892 --> 00:33:42,932
But that I cannot convince you like this

521
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:45,043
unless until you get your Realization.

522
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:48,514
There's some people who may be very beautiful outside

523
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:52,440
but inside would be like snakes. This can be.

524
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:55,440
So best thing is to have the beauty within.

525
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:57,359
That attracts the people.

526
00:33:57,665 --> 00:34:02,080
See Me, I have so many disciples, now are so many all over the world.

527
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,170
But now what do I do to them? Nothing. I just connect them

528
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:07,543
to the Divine as through this.

529
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,622
And there are 1000 petals inside your brain,

530
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:15,720
which gets enlightened and you become one with the Divine,

531
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,267
and the divine power starts flowing through you.

532
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:23,415
You become divine. Then you know what to wear,

533
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:27,880
how to behave, everything automatic. It is spontaneous.

534
00:34:28,157 --> 00:34:31,639
I don't have to tell you, "Do this" or "Do that", nothing.

535
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,400
It just works out. You are your own master.

536
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't have to tell you anything.

537
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:39,599
You can find out what is good for you, what is bad for you.

538
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,160
This is not only for longevity I am saying,

539
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,679
but I am saying for the global peace.

540
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,880
You want to have it spread to

541
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:52,519
people through your endeavors, through your

542
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,067
different ideas and creativity, to all the people of the world.

543
00:34:57,268 --> 00:35:00,000
So the problems that are created by human beings -

544
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:03,520
mainly they are the problems. And they can be solved.

545
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,605
If a human being becomes so beautiful inside,

546
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:10,734
then outside also he looks beautiful,

547
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,157
and also he can  create a very beautiful

548
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,359
loving world.

549
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,124
So, I would say you can ask Me some questions.

550
00:35:24,936 --> 00:35:27,118
Eric? Come here.

551
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,711
Q: Are you happy with the [unclear] people

552
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:31,584
who'd come to the Albert Hall this year?

553
00:35:31,808 --> 00:35:34,568
SM: Eric, you come here. It's all right.

554
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,873
SY - Shri Mataji, were you happy with the people

555
00:35:37,074 --> 00:35:38,624
who came to the Albert Hall this year?

556
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:40,650
SM: Of course, why not?

557
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:43,984
I was very, very happy. Was very happy.

558
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:47,914
I'm always happy otherwise.

559
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,839
Whether they come or don't come makes no difference to Me.

560
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,189
Q: How do you realize? How do you, how do you realize this ?

561
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,023
SM: I was born like this.

562
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,884
I see, how do you realize that you are a human being?

563
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:07,480
Q: No that you, you are accepting...

564
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,359
How do you realize that you are accepting

565
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,040
the change, the transition within yourself?

566
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
How do you know that it's happening to you?

567
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,801
SY: Is "you", you or Shri Mataji?

568
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:19,439
Q: How does one realize?

569
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,973
SY: How do we know when we're self realized?

570
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:25,039
SM: Ah, that's a good question.

571
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,040
That you know when you have in your hands

572
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,187
a cool or a hot breeze coming out.

573
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:32,759
Hot breeze is there because

574
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,347
if you have not forgiven, there won't be any.

575
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,599
But if you put your hands like this,

576
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,020
you should get cool breeze blowing into you.

577
00:36:42,221 --> 00:36:43,600
What is this cool breeze?

578
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,950
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. That you can feel.

579
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:51,052
And also it comes out of your fontanel bone area. Yours it is,

580
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,680
not mine, yours, and you can feel it.

581
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,726
This is the first sign.

582
00:36:55,927 --> 00:37:00,279
Then you start seeing the miracles you can do with your hand.

583
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,519
For hair dress also I should say,

584
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,811
that if there is one realized lady,

585
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:09,289
she will exactly know how to make the hair -

586
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,344
because you become extremely creative.

587
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,199
And not that you stick to one style,

588
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,708
or you copy somebody, but you have your own style.

589
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,025
In everything you have your own style.

590
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:39,603
SY: The only way is to experience it, then you know,

591
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,160
so you may stay and ask Her to show you in a while.

592
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Then you can feel it.

593
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,199
The best way is to feel it yourself Shri Mataji,

594
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,919
then you don't have to describe it, you just know it.

595
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,258
SM: Self esteem and it's not overpowering, it's within yourself.

596
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,240
Such peace and such joy - within yourself. It's not overpowering.

597
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,049
On the contrary, it is so much spreading, so much

598
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,280
capturing other people, on a very higher level.

599
00:38:14,504 --> 00:38:17,680
Not on a mundane level, or on a very

600
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,639
low levels as people try to do.

601
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,199
It's very, very divine

602
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:29,611
and extremely beautiful, I tell you.

603
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,832
Ask the question!

604
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,150
Have I answered all of your questions?
M: To my questions.

605
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:44,042
Q: What he said?

606
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,839
SY: Are there any other questions?

607
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,839
SY: Mother, could the ladies and

608
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,112
the people here tonight experience Self Realization?

609
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:56,269
SY: Can, can they experience it? Can You show us?

610
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,120
Should I try? All right. Then it's good.

611
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,337
It's very good.

612
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,397
And you will really become real professionals.

613
00:39:05,598 --> 00:39:09,999
As I know, Mr. Emro has been so kind

614
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,600
to announce it, but there are so many who have got all this

615
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,951
but they are shy and they came quiet.

616
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,320
And they don't want to share it also,

617
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:23,379
because they think that people think they are mad,

618
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,480
there's something wrong with them.

619
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,320
So it's very simple. It's very simple. You all can get it.

620
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,479
Should be take out our shoes?

621
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,559
SY: It's best to take for meditation and to feel

622
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,369
those energies inside.

623
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,605
It's best to take the shoes off so that you can

624
00:39:38,806 --> 00:39:42,279
get a good grounding on the, on the earth, on the floor.

625
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,519
Q: Our socks as well?

626
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,851
SY: Whichever you feel. If you feel more relaxed,

627
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,639
take your socks [as well].

628
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,720
SM: The socks you can have, but... it's o.k.

629
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,880
SY: Whatever you feel.

630
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,597
SM: I'm very happy there are so many ladies.

631
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,119
Because, you now, the women are very powerful.

632
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,320
They are very powerful - they don't know their powers.

633
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,386
Of course. Now put both the feet on the ground, like this,

634
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:19,826
little away from each other,

635
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,729
and just put your both hands towards Me.

636
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,199
[I must tell you], this is your right to have it.

637
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,515
There's no obligation, nothing.

638
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:34,279
It's your right to have it and you can all get it. No problems.

639
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,096
You can get it in no time.

640
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:58,146
As I've told you, you have to forgive everyone.

641
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:01,931
Forgive everything, because that was past and finished.

642
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:04,524
We have to be in the present.

643
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:07,599
So, forgive everyone,

644
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:11,034
and also forgive yourself.

645
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,960
You shouldn't feel guilty about anything,

646
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,044
you should not be guilty about anything.

647
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:19,200
Just forgive everyone, that's very important.

648
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,519
For you to have the experience

649
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,333
it's important that you forgive.

650
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:31,360
If you don't forgive, then you will feel hot breeze coming in.

651
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,311
But If you forgive yourself and others,

652
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,553
there will be nice cool breeze blowing in your hands.

653
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,257
Now, just put your right hand towards Me, and see

654
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:55,439
with your left hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

655
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,919
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

656
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,319
You can bend your head. And see for yourself,

657
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,544
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming through.

658
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,514
You can see it - maybe on the sides might be,

659
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:23,200
but don't put it on top of the head, but above the head.

660
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,679
You just move your hand little bit here and there,

661
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,155
and just put your right hand towards Me.

662
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,960
If it is hot that means you have not forgiven

663
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,719
yourself, or you have not forgiven others.

664
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,883
So, now put your left hand towards Me

665
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:50,541
and put your right hand on top of your head.

666
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:54,063
Again, just see.

667
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,159
Do not doubt yourself. Please don't doubt, have faith in yourself.

668
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,190
Now it will rise, it will rise.

669
00:43:07,662 --> 00:43:10,358
Once more. Put your right hand towards Me,

670
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,239
and put your left hand towards Me and see for yourself.

671
00:43:24,357 --> 00:43:28,140
Bend your head and close your eyes.

672
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:33,132
Please close your eyes.

673
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,604
That's all. Now, just put your hands like this,

674
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:51,240
and those who have felt cool breeze or a hot breeze,

675
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:55,908
on these fingertips, or on the palm,

676
00:43:56,156 --> 00:44:00,141
or out of the fontanel bone, raise your hands.

677
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:06,250
Oh, not yet? Yes, it will work out. B: What's that?

678
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,968
Lady: I feel cool on my head and also my hands.

679
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,767
SM: Hand you felt, not here? 
SY: Cool on the head, Shri Mataji. She feels cool.

680
00:44:13,968 --> 00:44:17,600
SM: Then it's alright because your this center is little bit in trouble.

681
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:19,455
It will be alright.

682
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:22,369
If you have felt it on your head it's alright, we will work it out.

683
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,799
What about you?
Lady: Hot.

684
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,792
SM: What is she saying?
SY: It's hot? Is it blowing hot?

685
00:44:28,993 --> 00:44:29,993
Lady: The hot.
SY: It's hot.

686
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:32,279
SM: In the hands? Hot.

687
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,400
SM: Alright, so please forgive. Please forgive.

688
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,799
You see, now see, logic is like this.

689
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,565
Wether you forgive, you don't forgive, what do you do?

690
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,359
Nothing.

691
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,415
By not forgiving you're torturing yourself.

692
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,562
See the point?

693
00:44:47,763 --> 00:44:50,480
Now, so you please forgive Me, really forgive.

694
00:44:51,493 --> 00:44:53,702
Put your hands towards Me.

695
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,326
Now cooler?
Lady: No.

696
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,001
SM: Not yet?

697
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:05,452
I'll have to work on you.

698
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,680
I have to work for your forgiveness.

699
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,127
Anyone there? They all have felt it?

700
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:19,560
Alright. So, come along.

701
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,304
SY: Remove the chair with you.

702
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,879
SM: Sit.
Lady: Where should I sit? here?

703
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,840
SM: Can you sit?
Lady: I can sit...

704
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:34,639
SM: Put your right hand towards Me. 
Lady: Alright.

705
00:45:34,948 --> 00:45:36,874
Left hand on the earth.

706
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:39,980
SY: On the earth. 
SM: Now forgive.

707
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:48,117
Liver. You have a liver problem.

708
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:50,731
Lady: I do?
SM: Little bit.

709
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:53,828
You think too much.
Lady: I work too hard.

710
00:45:54,029 --> 00:45:56,580
SM: Are you futuristic?

711
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:58,431
Are you futuristic?
Lady: What?

712
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:01,393
SY: Planing, planing, getting worked up a lot.

713
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:04,392
Lady: No, I live, I live with lot of [unclear] who think of the past

714
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,520
but I'm not futuristic.

715
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,917
SY: Not futuristic.

716
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,960
SM: Forgive, please forgive.

717
00:46:17,058 --> 00:46:18,079
Lady: It's hard.

718
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,760
SY: Say it, say that, that "I forgive everybody" - just say it.

719
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,948
Lady: I don't know if I am ready.

720
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,079
SY: Please say it. Then you've done it. It's easy.

721
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,560
SY: But Chris she's not ready yet. Not ready yet.

722
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,681
SM: You are all ready. Now don't have this diffidence within you.

723
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,823
Otherwise you would not have come here. Alright?

724
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:39,624
Lady: Okay, I'll forgive...

725
00:46:39,825 --> 00:46:42,107
SM: You are all ready. Come along, have it.

726
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:43,572
Lady: Come on,  I forgive.

727
00:46:43,773 --> 00:46:46,573
SM: Forgive, good. Very good idea.

728
00:46:48,118 --> 00:46:49,825
It's cooler?

729
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:53,262
Lady: It's still hot, it's still hot!

730
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:55,874
SM: We know...

731
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,003
SY: Keep say, "I'll forgive everybody" - you'll enjoy it.

732
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:04,494
SY: Say that inside, inside. SY: Yeah, inside.

733
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:07,546
SM: It's still. Liver?

734
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,159
SM: Better now?
L: It's cool, yeah, it's cooler.

735
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,819
Not so hot, not so hot.

736
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,572
SM: It's an experience, it's not just

737
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,439
telling you, it's an experience. It's the truth.

738
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,943
Now she's feeling.

739
00:47:28,575 --> 00:47:30,279
Better now, much better.

740
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:33,077
Lady: I see, yeah, not so hot, yeah, not so hot.

741
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:36,511
SM: Good.

742
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:48,229
Much better. You come along.

743
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:53,240
You felt it in the head. Not in the hands.

744
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,835
Can you face that side?

745
00:47:57,036 --> 00:47:58,319
Lady: This side?

746
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,840
SY: Towards her. 
L: Towards her?

747
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,766
SY: Like that? Move back. On the Vishuddhi.

748
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:11,040
SM: Does she sing or? 
SY: Do you sing?

749
00:48:11,241 --> 00:48:12,834
L: Yeah.

750
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:18,619
SM: Come back, yes, come back, please. I'll give vibrations on Vishuddhi.

751
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,440
She may develop spondylitis? Very bad.

752
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:44,954
Don't feel guilty.

753
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,219
Do you feel guilty?

754
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,765
SM: Are you a catholic?
L: No...

755
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:56,876
SM: Then you should not feel.

756
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,800
What work do you do?
SY: What work?

757
00:49:08,386 --> 00:49:10,172
L: What work do I do?

758
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:12,679
SY: She runs my desk.

759
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,719
SY: She's at his desk. SY: Receptionist.

760
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,080
SY: Reception, yes. 
SM: She's at the desk.

761
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,789
SY: Busy

762
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,527
SM: Now, are you feeling in your hands - just see.

763
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:46,000
SY: Put your hands up and tell Her.

764
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:51,758
SM: Turn now.

765
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,600
Now, feel?

766
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,080
Little bit? Alright.

767
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,400
May God bless you.

768
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:47,229
Any other questions?

769
00:50:56,462 --> 00:51:00,084
Have I answered all your questions?

770
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,689
So now, you will have to understand how to meditate.

771
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:13,559
That's all. And if you understand that,

772
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,494
you'll grow, grow very fast.

773
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:19,559
I'm sure you will grow and then you'll be amazed at your

774
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,240
[unclear].

775
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,400
Because you will not feel disturbed.

776
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:27,640
There will be no stress, strain again. Very happy you will be.

777
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,240
Because what's the use of getting into stress?

778
00:51:32,441 --> 00:51:36,348
You cannot solve it, the problem you cannot solve.

779
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:43,239
You can only solve the problem by solving yourself.

780
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,639
Because the problem is with you, not without.

781
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,680
If you think like that, it's alright.

782
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,680
And you all can feel very much better.

783
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,569
You will sleep better, and you'll enjoy life much better.

784
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:59,359
So, I would like to invite you all to India also,

785
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,080
if possible, please come.

786
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,280
We have a very good session there, we have the seashore

787
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,439
and enjoy yourself. She has been to one of the

788
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,639
Institutions of Sahaja Yoga for Music.

789
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,583
And see how she has picked up! I was amazed the way she was playing.

790
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,453
It's a very great thing.

791
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,800
Indian music is not easy, you can't learn that easy.

792
00:52:22,001 --> 00:52:24,919
But I was surprised, in three months,

793
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,012
the boys were singing [bhajans]

794
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:29,039
I said, "How did you [unclear]"...

795
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,877
Imagine, in three, three...

796
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:35,480
months only. I mean, you take years together to learn.

797
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,451
So many things happened in...

798
00:52:38,652 --> 00:52:41,287
Because they have become realized souls,

799
00:52:41,488 --> 00:52:44,342
and they can pick up things very fast.

800
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,359
I was amazed, really, how they have picked up.

801
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,080
She has picked up tabla very...

802
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:52,161
in India also you wouldn't find any woman who can play at tabla.

803
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,387
It's really remarkable.

804
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,594
Remarkable things happened.

805
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,160
And you yourself will become remarkable, yourself.

806
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,239
Alright, thank you very much. Thank you, may God bless you.

807
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,440
So you can take help from Emro,

808
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,599
he can help you I think in giving Realization.

809
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,959
It's a very good thing you have done - I'm really thankful to you.

810
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,359
Because I wanted to talk to ladies first

811
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,973
because they don't know how powerful they are.

812
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:30,341
Catherine!

813
00:53:31,091 --> 00:53:34,295
SY: So now, if anybody wants to know more about Sahaja Yoga

814
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:37,520
or Self Realization

815
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
there's a lot...

816
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,640
SY: He's now got information there, if anybody wants

817
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,141
to know a bit more about Sahaja Yoga

818
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:49,047
SM: It's really great, I must say.

819
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:52,320
SY: So we should do some sessions here also.

820
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:55,337
SM: Also there was, one actor who came to see Me,

821
00:53:55,538 --> 00:53:56,887
he had a problema,

822
00:53:57,088 --> 00:54:00,720
I don't know where he is lost. 
SY: Pardon? The actor?

823
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,840
SM: Some actor.
SY: The actor

824
00:54:06,846 --> 00:54:09,687
SM: He knows him.

825
00:54:11,426 --> 00:54:14,360
You should try to get some actors and actresses, you see.

826
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:18,599
It will be a good idea. Because they're all suffering and

827
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,104
actually they die very fast.

828
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,160
SY: Thank you very much. Thank you.
