Evening Program, Eve of Mahashivaratri Puja
Australia, 25 February 1995

2
00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:14,999
[Shri Mataji's talk starts at the end of
the evening program: minute 02:34:50)

02:34:50,619 --> 02:34:55,096
Congratulations to Brian Bell and to
all the…

3
02:35:23,902 --> 02:35:28,568
I said congratulations to Brian Bell

4
02:35:52,313 --> 02:35:56,401
and to all the actors and actresses.

5
02:36:07,148 --> 02:36:12,102
To be very frank I never think of my past.

6
02:36:13,454 --> 02:36:18,783
So I was wondering what is this drama
going about.

7
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:30,860
The most important thing in this life is
to enlighten as many people as possible.

8
02:36:31,061 --> 02:36:34,778
I am very much thankful to you

9
02:36:36,335 --> 02:36:42,073
for expressing your joy,

10
02:36:42,274 --> 02:36:54,967
your talents to express the reality.

11
02:36:56,579 --> 02:37:04,290
Reality is not in which what we believe but
it is beyond.

12
02:37:04,498 --> 02:37:11,979
But the way people believe in reality is
something illusion, illusionary.

13
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:16,975
That is the curse of Kali Yuga.

14
02:37:17,176 --> 02:37:19,477
I must say it is brought out very well,

15
02:37:19,678 --> 02:37:27,239
the way you showed people around, but not
easy to convince so easily, I tell you.

16
02:37:28,587 --> 02:37:33,887
Now it’s different. It used to be very
difficult in the beginning –

17
02:37:34,088 --> 02:37:43,231
too many arguments and all kinds of funny
answers and questions.

18
02:37:43,432 --> 02:37:52,191
Now life has changed I think – we are so
many, so many good Sahaja Yogis,

19
02:37:52,392 --> 02:38:02,609
and in Australia I am sure it’s going to be
a very tremendous success.

20
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:10,447
I was surprised at the way people had
to stand outside in that big hall,

21
02:38:10,648 --> 02:38:12,919
shows the awakening is spreading

22
02:38:13,169 --> 02:38:19,320
and people are now trying to understand
that there is something beyond.

23
02:38:19,521 --> 02:38:27,122
It’s only your behaviour, it’s only your
vibrations which has created this.

24
02:38:27,323 --> 02:38:33,209
If I could do everything myself alone,
I would not have needed anyone.

25
02:38:33,410 --> 02:38:40,446
But no I can’t do it, I have to have
channels, and I have to do it through you.

26
02:38:40,647 --> 02:38:46,081
When the channels are so good, they are
working it out for me.

27
02:38:46,282 --> 02:38:52,248
Now I look back sometimes because just now
you were showing the past

28
02:38:52,582 --> 02:38:59,423
that first coming to Australia I just
thought

29
02:38:59,624 --> 02:39:07,304
it’s a Ganesha’s land and things will
work out.

30
02:39:07,505 --> 02:39:11,809
It has, I must say, it has worked out very
well.

31
02:39:12,010 --> 02:39:14,604
So many people are showing their talents.

32
02:39:14,805 --> 02:39:19,294
It’s amazing how they can sing Indian songs

33
02:39:19,495 --> 02:39:23,791
or do these Indian dancing, it’s very
amazing.

34
02:39:23,992 --> 02:39:30,984
And this play of Shiva was also another
great achievement I think

35
02:39:31,184 --> 02:39:41,025
in expressing how all the religions said
the same thing.

36
02:39:42,199 --> 02:39:49,893
But as you know people have misinterpreted
for their own purposes.

37
02:39:50,094 --> 02:39:54,993
I am so very happy all of you had found out
the reality about yourself,

38
02:39:55,218 --> 02:40:01,462
the reality about life and the Spirit that
is within you.

39
02:40:01,757 --> 02:40:09,288
I never expected so much to happen in my
lifetime, I thank you for that.

40
02:40:09,489 --> 02:40:12,457
May God bless you all.
