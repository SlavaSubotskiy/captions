1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,200
Today we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

2
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,700
You all know the story of His birth and I need not repeat it.

3
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:39,410
But, as He was created by the Mother only, by Adi Shakti,

4
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,990
in the same way you are all created after Him.

5
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,790
So, you are on the path of Shri Ganesha already.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,370
Your eyes sparkle the same way His eyes sparkle.

7
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,950
You all have the beautiful glow on your face as He had.

8
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,120
Whether you are small, big or old makes no difference.

9
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,990
All the beauty comes to us through the glow of Shri Ganesha.

10
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,330
If He's satisfied, then we don't have to worry

11
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,290
about any other deities,

12
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,500
because the power of all the deities is Shri Ganesha.

13
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,040
He's like a vice-chancellor sitting on every chakra.

14
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,870
Unless and until He signs, Kundalini cannot cross through,

15
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,750
because Kundalini’s the Gauri and is the Virgin Mother of Shri Ganesh.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,120
Now we have to understand that we are here

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,540
in the Western society where so much has gone wrong

18
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,500
because we never bother to look after Shri Ganesha.

19
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,250
Christ came and His message spread all over the world.

20
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:43,500
He talked of things which are not practised by Christians, not at all.

21
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,660
Because whatever they started is not based on truth.

22
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,250
Truth is that Shri Ganesha took birth as Christ.

23
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,000
If that is the truth, then they have to understand

24
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,700
in the light of Shri Ganesha this great incarnation of Christ.

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:28,040
That is, He has told people that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,950
Actually, for a saint, He doesn’t know what is an adulterous eyes,

27
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,540
because He just sees. He just sees.

28
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,910
As Shri Gyaneshwara’s beautifully said, NIRANJANABANI

29
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,080
to see without any reaction, just to see.

30
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,830
That is the quality of innocence, which was brought to light by Christ,

31
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,500
our Lord, but we did not imbibe anyone of these qualities.

32
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,000
Now supposing you are worshipping today Shri Ganesh.

33
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,120
So why are you worshipping Shri Ganesha?

34
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,870
You’re worshipping because your Ganesha must be awakened,

35
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,290
that you should have the qualities of Shri Ganesha within you,

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,580
that you should feel that innocence in your eyes.

37
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,040
Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

38
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,500
If you are sitting here and worshipping Shri Ganesha

39
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:59,080
and you are not trying to put your attention to your ascent

40
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,910
as Shri Ganesh, then it is useless.

41
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:17,950
And then He is an eternal child. He doesn't have ego,

42
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,750
He doesn't have any conditionings. So, He’s an eternal child.

43
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,790
We have to become eternal children of our Mother.

44
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:38,870
To get to that state, what do we have to do is simple,

45
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,250
that o to raise our Kundalini, fix it up,

46
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,990
o to do meditation and o keep our attention inside,

47
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,040
more, and o not to react.

48
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,540
Now, to say not to react means just to watch.

49
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:17,750
And when you watch without thinking about it, then the truth,

50
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,870
which is really poetry, comes out.

51
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,370
That's why a poet sees much more than an ordinary person can see.

52
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:40,830
The inner’s beauty just starts penetrating your vision

53
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,080
and you start seeing it.

54
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,450
So, you have seen children, whatever may be their origin,

55
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,660
from whatever country they might be coming, whether it is Japan

56
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,000
or whether it is England, India, Australia, anywhere,

57
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,370
see the children are normally very beautiful.

58
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:16,660
Once I went to Japan and there was a shrine they wanted Me to see,

59
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,250
so I saw some ladies coming down - three, four ladies.

60
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,580
They’re western ladies. They said, “Don’t go. Don’t go.

61
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,500
There are some children - horrible.”

62
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,500
I said, “Why?”

63
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
“They call you witch. They called us all,

64
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,950
“Witches, witches, witches”, Japanese children.”

65
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,660
I said, “How do you know? They must be saying in Japanese.”

66
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,370
“No, we asked the meaning,

67
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,370
so they told us it means witches.

68
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,500
We look like witches to them, so better not go.”

69
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,790
I said, “It’s all right. Let Me go.” And when I went up,

70
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,750
they all came running, clung to Me, kissed Me, this thing.

71
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,990
They wouldn’t allow Me to go to the shrine

72
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,950
and then they walked all the way to the shrine, they came back.

73
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,540
I didn’t know their language or anything. So sweet.

74
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,830
Kissing My sari, kissing My hand, so sweet they were.

75
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,450
And I was surprised that how is it they call the other ladies

76
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
as witches and to Us, to Me, and My daughters were also with us.

77
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,700
And My daughters are very fond of children.

78
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,950
So then they said, “You see, why to go to the shrine?

79
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,330
We’ll play with the children.”

80
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,160
I said, „Let’s go to the shrine, after all.“

81
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,950
So when we went up, these children also came with us

82
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,370
and walked down. And their mothers were so surprised, you see,

83
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,120
they said normally to all the foreigners,

84
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:49,120
to all the foreigners they say „witches“ or even to men

85
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,250
they say they are devils. „Devils are coming.“

86
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,700
Because Japanese are short people, you see,

87
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,540
and the size of our Western people are quite big

88
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,660
and perhaps maybe that is the reason, whatever it is

89
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,750
or maybe something else, I don’t know.

90
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,750
And they wouldn’t, I mean, even talk to them.

91
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,040
They all ran away, calling them, „Witches, witches“,

92
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,450
from the windows and from every corner. Then I realized, you see,

93
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,500
these small, little children, their Ganesha is awakened in them.

94
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,160
Everybody's Ganesha is awakened when you are born.

95
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,250
All the animals have their Ganesha intact with them,

96
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,450
specially the birds. We never think how birds,

97
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,910
all the way from Siberia go to Australia.

98
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,750
What direction comes to them, from where?

99
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,370
They have got a magnet within themselves. That is Shri Ganesh.

100
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,750
Magnet is Shri Ganesha.

101
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:03,410
So, this magnet, which is within us can attract innocent people

102
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,160
and repel cunning, horrible

103
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,620
as they call witch and devils and all those.

104
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,370
So this magnet has both the qualities,

105
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,870
that it repels those who are not all right

106
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,870
and it attracts those who are innocent.

107
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,870
And that is why in Sahaja Yoga we find that we cannot tolerate

108
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,500
some people somehow or other, we try, we try, we try.

109
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,290
But somehow or other it’s a bit difficult, you know.

110
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,000
They don’t know what is the reason. The reason is Ganesha.

111
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,660
Now, in the Western society, as you know,

112
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,790
not that they’ve not paid any attention to their Ganesha quality,

113
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,540
but they have talked too much about the perversion of Shri Ganesha.

114
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,620
They talk on the television, they talk here, there, in every way.

115
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The children see it and so many small, little children are suffering

116
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,830
from Shri Ganesh problem, very small children.

117
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:24,700
How do they get into these problems is because of the atmosphere is full of it.

118
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,040
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also we have some people

119
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,410
who just stick on hypocritically and they have Ganesha problem.

120
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,330
And there are some who support. This fellow can say,

121
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,660
„Oh, I was such a sick man, I had no wife

122
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,370
or I’ve had no love from my parents“ or anything

123
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,910
and others start supporting.

124
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,950
This kind of sympathy is very dangerous, is extremely dangerous.

125
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,910
First of all, this sympathy ruins that person

126
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,200
who cannot get over his problems and gradually

127
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,290
you also pick up these problems. Instead of helping him,

128
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,500
that you do the meditation of Ganesha,

129
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,080
you just sit on the Mother Earth, say „Atharva Sheersha“,

130
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,080
use the candle. Your problem will go away. Instead of that,

131
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,500
they start sympathizing. This is not sympathy.

132
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,830
It’s sym-pathy. „Sym“ means „to share“, „Pathy“ means „pathos.“

133
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,040
So you share all the problems of that person yourself.

134
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,620
So, never support a wrong thing.

135
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,080
If you really love that person, you care for that person,

136
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,950
you have to tell that person, "This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong."

137
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,870
Moreover, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people of seventy years

138
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,120
also want to get married. I can’t understand, you know.

139
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,160
After all, loneliness is not possible in Sahaja Yoga,

140
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:14,250
you have so many Sahaja Yogis. Where is the loneliness?

141
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,660
I never feel lonely. I would love to be sometimes.

142
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,290
If you are not with Me, My family is with Me.

143
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,660
I’m never alone and I’m never alone when I’m alone, really.

144
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,620
I enjoy Myself best when I’m alone

145
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,080
because I have time to reflect back as to what we have achieved,

146
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,700
as to how these moments were beautiful moments of meeting you all,

147
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,080
all those beautiful places I visited with you, all the enjoyments.

148
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,910
So all such people who are explaining

149
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,330
their problems of Mooladhara have to know one thing,

150
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,660
that this is a sure certificate for them

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,080
to go to hell, absolutely.

152
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,080
Because either from the Mooladhara, you know,

153
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,120
all kinds of diseases come in which are incurable,

154
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,990
according to the doctor. Say, you take multiple sclerosis.

155
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,950
From multiple sclerosis through all the disabilities of the muscles,

156
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:40,990
even cancers could be started by Mooladhara problem.

157
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,750
Why is it so much cancer in the Western countries

158
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,910
than in any other countries? Everybody has an explanation.

159
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,080
Somebody said there are not so many doctors of cancer,

160
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,330
that’s why there are. It’s not so.

161
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,620
Now, you see the disease of schizophrenia

162
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,870
also can come from Mooladhara problem.

163
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,620
Of course, you know AIDS is nothing but Mooladhara problem.

164
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,370
But still, if you want to make a martyrdom out of that, that

165
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,910
„We are AIDS soldiers walking to our death,“

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,750
then what can you do to such stupid people?

167
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,700
And stupidity comes also from Mooladhara,

168
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,540
because He is the giver of wisdom.

169
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,540
How do you get the wisdom?

170
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,410
Only by awakening your Shri Ganesh. He is the giver of wisdom.

171
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:06,870
Now, all kinds of people do stupidities, unbelievable - unbelievable.

172
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,080
Like in India recently I asked them for bigger bangles,

173
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,290
for the ladies have bigger hands here and they came back

174
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,370
to say that these days all big bangles are going to America.

175
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,830
So why?

176
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,540
Because the men have decided to wear bangles in America.

177
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,540
Now in India, if you give one bangle to any man,

178
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,910
means an insult to him that „You are not a man.“

179
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,870
All such stupidities, hundred and one, I tell you,

180
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,370
you see all over the world now because have come out of it.

181
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,250
All kinds of things come because their Mooladhara is not all right.

182
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,290
In India now, for example, we all wear saris. Nobody knows.

183
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,200
I mean, logically also we should wear saris

184
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,660
because saris are made by villagers and they earn out of it

185
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,330
and that’s how we support this thing. Culturally,

186
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,830
we like it also because it suggests we are shy women,

187
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,830
we don’t want to expose our body too much and thirdly,

188
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,040
it’s very good for the mothers,

189
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,790
that mothers can nurse the children and look after them.

190
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,000
So, it has various aspects, but nobody thinks the logic of it.

191
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,160
They think it’s very practical and it has been there for traditions.

192
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,040
Now, supposing you say, „All right, come along,

193
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
give up your saris and wear something else,“

194
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,990
they’ll say, „Now, tell us another. No, no. Nothing doing.“

195
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:06,370
Nobody would accept it. Nobody would accept it, because they think

196
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,160
that saris are more gracious, they make you look like a woman.

197
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,910
There’s so much beautiful dress

198
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,450
and it does give chance for the artist to express themselves.

199
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,700
But this is only some intellectuals might be thinking,

200
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,750
but normally in the villages, if you tell them that you change over,

201
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,700
they say, „No.“ So nothing like a fashion can work out.

202
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,990
Nothing like a fashion can work out

203
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,540
because traditionally now they have reached certain stage of wisdom,

204
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,830
„Now, this is the best suited for us.“

205
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,370
So they won’t accept any nonsense.

206
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,200
Ha, if it is something sensible, which is never so,

207
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,330
I would say, from the West, they may.

208
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,120
But because the Western people have lost their wisdom,

209
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,790
there is nothing that comes sensible to India, nothing.

210
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,830
And whatever sensible they have, that is also going out.

211
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,290
Yesterday you heard such beautiful waltz.

212
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,580
I mean who plays these days waltz?

213
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,370
Thousands will gather at some sort of a noisy pop, hard music,

214
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,580
which can penetrate into your ears and can make you deaf.

215
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,620
There’s no wisdom in all these things.

216
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,330
They want all the time some sort of a sensation.

217
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,580
I was told people come here for skiing.

218
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,080
Now some I saw people jumping with a parachute.

219
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,910
Ask an Indian. He’ll say, „You better do it.

220
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,750
I’m not here to break my legs.“

221
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,500
That he understands the wisdom that

222
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,080
„My body is more important than anything else.

223
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,870
What is this sensation for?“

224
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,370
The skiing, so many people have seen, they’ve lost their kidneys.

225
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,990
They have lost their legs. They’ll have artificial legs for skiing.

226
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,370
This sensation comes as a great attraction for people

227
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,660
who have no wisdom. It doesn't appeal to the wisdom.

228
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:22,700
So, the people who are wise don’t take to stupid things.

229
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,950
Though Shri Ganesha is the child, but He is the giver of wisdom.

230
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,750
So we can say our children are the giver of wisdom

231
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,330
if we keep them on the line of wisdom.

232
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,290
You listen to them, how they talk, how wisely they talk.

233
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,120
Sometimes they have a conference with Me

234
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,990
and they tell Me all about you people, what you are up to

235
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,620
and they take Me into confidence completely and say that

236
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,330
„Don’t tell uncle or auntie, but we’ll tell You this.“

237
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,830
And small, small things they say, that „auntie was wearing the sari

238
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,870
You gave her and then, you know, she put it on the ground.“

239
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,000
All little, little things they know, so sweet they are.

240
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,080
See yesterday how they came rushing and kissed Me so sweet,

241
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,200
without them the world would have been like a desert without any flowers, you know.

242
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,040
So, Shri Ganesha has created you.

243
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,950
Because of Him, you were born.

244
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,750
He’s the one who looked after you when you were in the womb of the mother.

245
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:48,830
He's the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time.

246
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,040
He’s the one who has looked after your nourishment, everything.

247
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,410
He's the one who has looked after your development of the fetus,

248
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,160
of the brain and everything.

249
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,910
All is done that by this great personality, Shri Ganesh.

250
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:11,120
How much we owe to Him. Apart from that,

251
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,500
He gives us the basic wisdom. I mean, a villager,

252
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,990
supposing you talk to a villager who is not exposed

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,540
to all these non-sensical sensations, you’ll find him

254
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,370
extremely practical and wise.

255
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,200
There’s a story that one villager was travelling by train with other boys

256
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,790
who were very flamboyant and thinking that they were very smart.

257
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,370
So, they were trying to tease the man.

258
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,370
So, a boy asked a question to him.

259
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:53,870
„Now, if the butter is selling for one pound, for a quarter of a pound,

260
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,700
what will be the price of the egg in the next station?“

261
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,120
He looked at him. He said, „All right, you tell me what.

262
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,370
Then, you cannot tell the price of the egg,

263
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:23,080
then can you tell me the price, can you tell me my age?“

264
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,500
He looked at him. He said, „You must be twenty-two.“

265
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,580
He said. „How do you know?“

266
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,330
He said, „I have a brother who is eleven years and he is half mad,

267
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,660
but you are full mad.“

268
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,660
So, an ordinary villager answered this smart fellow

269
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,500
and the smart fellow didn’t know where to go.

270
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,250
So, all this smartness and cleverness finishes off

271
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,500
when it comes to innocence.

272
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,910
Now, many people have a feeling also that we have lost our innocence.

273
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,620
That is something, an eternal quality you have got.

274
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,830
You never lose your innocence.

275
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,620
Maybe, as clouds can cover the whole sky,

276
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,200
maybe your ego and conditionings and your mistakes

277
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,620
might have covered it, but it is always there, always there.

278
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:51,000
Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner

279
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,290
that you respect your innocence.

280
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,200
Not to feel shy about your innocence, never.

281
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,580
Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence

282
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:15,540
will definitely give you that wisdom by which

283
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,040
you can solve all the problems without any difficulty.

284
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,120
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

285
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,370
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

286
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,000
She created Him from the Aumkara.

287
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,750
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

288
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:53,250
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

289
00:25:53,830 --> 00:26:00,410
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

290
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:14,160
which have light in it. They have all the causals of all the elements,

291
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,200
only on the right side.

292
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,410
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

293
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,080
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

294
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:39,700
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

295
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,830
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

296
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:56,330
but if anything is done against the Mother, then He goes all wild.

297
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:04,080
Then He punishes and that is how the divine justice is brought to people.

298
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,990
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

299
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,580
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

300
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,790
the protocol of the Mother.

301
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,910
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

302
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,080
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

303
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,910
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

304
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,620
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

305
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,080
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

306
00:27:50,370 --> 00:28:00,750
For many people are still in the West anxious to copy other people,

307
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,160
fall back into the wrong ideas,

308
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:13,450
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

309
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Thank God you all have come out of it

310
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,990
and when you see the hell into which the Western society has fallen,

311
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,580
you try to understand and enjoy that you are at a different state altogether.

312
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,500
But still, among you there will be some who will be dangling.

313
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,540
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

314
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,080
and go also with them.

315
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,870
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

316
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,000
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

317
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:50,040
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

318
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,500
So you are here as saviours and you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

319
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,500
which is to be used. So today's Puja

320
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,290
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

321
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:09,500
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

322
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,870
that You manifest within ourselves.

323
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:17,410
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

324
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,120
and all these wrong ideas we have

325
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,200
or all the wrong life we have had,

326
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,750
should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight

327
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,580
of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.”

328
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,250
Let us manifest these qualities.

329
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,950
This is what is to be asked.

330
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,790
Today is a great day. I’m very happy we are in Austria,

331
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,660
which I call is the country of divine weapons.

332
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,500
It’s a very wonderful country, as I told you before

333
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,910
that there is no fundamentalism here.

334
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,910
It’s very surprising, but I have discovered that in Austria

335
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,870
there have been people from all over the world

336
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,330
and they have been married here, it’s a small country,

337
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,750
so they all kept together. It’s a very nice place,

338
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,500
specially this place where we are.

339
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,830
I heard that it’s called as the holy land of Tyrol.

340
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,200
And we also saw lots of grace falling down with our eyes.

341
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,790
Everybody could see them, the grace coming down.

342
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,750
There was no rain, but you could see the grace.

343
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,990
Moreover, yesterday, the villagers remarked that this river overflows.

344
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,660
The whole glacier comes down and this river overflows,

345
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,200
but it did not. It kept to its maryadas.

346
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,910
They are quite surprised how it has happened

347
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,950
that it kept to its maryadas.

348
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:05,580
This is one thing and the second thing is they said

349
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:13,750
that they have never heard such great, absolutely volcanic,

350
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,700
roaring of the clouds, they’ve never heard such reports before

351
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,620
and it was really remarkable it rained so heavily

352
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,450
everything happened and we are all right.

353
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,620
Only in the central path of Sushumna it cleared out.

354
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,910
Maybe because I had to walk through that, so it cleared out that part.

355
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,000
But on the whole, all our programs went off very well

356
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,540
and we all enjoyed the last night’s program

357
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,990
and the musician also lost all count of time,

358
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,990
he played for four hours on his own.

359
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,250
I thought he’d just play one raga.

360
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,000
He went on and he wanted to play more, but then,

361
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,620
thank God, he thought of the puja perhaps and he stopped it.

362
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,790
So, let us try to be innocent within our self.

363
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,500
Be proud that we are innocent.

364
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,410
We need not be smart people.

365
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,080
Smartness is your mental attitude

366
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:20,120
and innocence is your innate quality

367
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,250
which is connected with this all-pervading power.

368
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,000
So, may God bless you all!

369
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,330
At least during the Puja there should not be

370
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,540
any movements outside or nearby.

371
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,990
If the children are sitting, well and good,

372
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,040
otherwise you can go out. But you shouldn’t disturb others

373
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,000
because their attention goes to you.

374
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,410
So, all those who are having any movements,

375
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,620
all of you also should come and sit with your children.

376
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,370
Why can’t your children sit down?

377
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,370
They will sit, bring them in.

378
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,830
Or if they are not sitting you go behind the curtain,

379
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,000
because they get disturbed, you see, there are Sahaja Yogis still

380
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,120
who are getting disturbed very easily

381
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,160
with the slightest movement here and there.

382
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,790
So, the first thing is to open your heart for Shri Ganesha.

383
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,750
As you see a child, how your heart opens.

384
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,500
In the same way, please open your hearts.

385
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,750
All right …

386
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,790
Ah, see, one thing is that He has got a hunter in His hand

387
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:58,000
and if you remember Christ used a hunter to hit all the people,

388
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,910
who were selling goods near the temple.

389
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,080
He could have used any other weapon, but He used a hunter.
