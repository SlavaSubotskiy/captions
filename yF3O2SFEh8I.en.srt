1
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:13,302
First, I will speak in Hindi language and then in English.

2
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:17,182
We are such a cosmopolitan people

3
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:20,942
that I don’t know what language to take to.

4
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:39,462
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi till 21:39 ]

1
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:46,235
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva.

2
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:51,281
In the form of Shri Shiva,

3
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:56,106
we have Shri Sadashiva himself,

4
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:00,151
and his reflection, Shri Shiva.

5
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:17,439
This Shiva's form in our heart

6
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:28,402
always

7
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:34,242
is sitting there in the form of the Spirit.

8
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,842
I'm not saying it's enlightened there.

9
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:45,479
When the Kundalini is awakened,

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,007
this Shiva's form gets enlightened.

11
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:58,126
And it gets enlightened in our nerves.

12
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:02,632
It's said about Chaitanya that it sits on fat.

13
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,504
First and foremost,

14
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:12,322
its light comes to our brain.

15
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,941
For the first time,

16
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:24,072
our heart and

17
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:29,239
our brain

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,384
become integrated (unite).

19
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:36,701
Otherwise, normally

20
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,105
man's intelligence runs on one side

21
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:44,892
and his emotions run on the other side.

22
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:52,913
Due to this union,

23
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:59,070
the light which inside us

24
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:03,165
spreads from the Spirit,

25
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:09,009
that light takes the form of vibrations and appears on our hands and

26
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,308
on our fontanelle bone area.

27
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,602
All of you know this.

28
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:22,607
But, you should know that

29
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:28,505
when this light comes into us,

30
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:34,150
we see that gradually our life changes.

31
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,608
All anger

32
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:45,748
and six enemies within us are finished.

33
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:49,816
Gradually everything drops out

34
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:54,328
and faith establishes in the mind.

35
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:59,897
From faith, wisdom gets awakened.

36
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:04,409
Nothing will remain important.

37
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:13,228
The personality of Shiva that we have seen

38
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:21,607
is that of an angel,

39
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,909
that of a great saint.

40
00:04:28,148 --> 00:04:31,042
He is like that.

41
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:35,153
He doesn't care about anything.

42
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:41,121
His hair are not properly done.

43
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,113
Nothing.

44
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:50,656
What he is wearing, what should be done, he doesn't think about it.

45
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:57,793
He has given all this work to

46
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,066
Vishnu.

47
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:08,787
He wears tiger skin and roams around.

48
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:16,421
And his vehicle is Nandi, who

49
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:20,014
doesn't come under control in any way.

50
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,424
It's not like horse that you can control.

51
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,016
Wherever Nandi goes Shiva goes with it.

52
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:34,275
He never thinks that what people will say.

53
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,649
What will others think.

54
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:43,495
If I dress like this and sit on Nandi, what will people say?

55
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:50,333
Because he is contented within himself.

56
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:54,715
He is sitting there with his own joy and happiness.

57
00:05:54,916 --> 00:06:00,938
He doesn't care about anything in this world that

58
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,621
"what will people say?".

59
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:07,915
He is not ashamed.

60
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:12,544
You must have heard about his wedding.

61
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:17,786
When he came for wedding,

62
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:23,055
when Shri Vishnu saw him

63
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:27,073
he said "who is this funny groom?

64
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:30,900
How my sister is marrying him?"

65
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:33,893
But Shri Parvati knew that

66
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:39,624
her consort would be this, a happy-go-lucky person.

67
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:41,905
He doesn't care about anything.

68
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:45,030
When a person goes higher than everything,

69
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:51,998
for him everything becomes unimportant.

70
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,052
His attention won't go in this direction.

71
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:02,042
This Shiva's incarnation that we see,

72
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:05,790
looks very dear and beloved to us.

73
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:12,825
And everyone thinks that all this done by Shri Shiva

74
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:16,490
is very special.

75
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,854
But, when Shiva's light comes into sahaja yogis,

76
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:28,098
their life start changing too.

77
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:30,680
I have seen that

78
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:38,195
before they come to Sahaja Yoga,

79
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:44,464
women, men also, liked good clothes very much.

80
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:50,741
All their attention used to go on what to wear.

81
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:53,671
And these days it's in fashion,

82
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:59,641
because everywhere beauty clinics have opened,

83
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:03,453
and women are badly stuck in these things.

84
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:11,015
But when the beauty comes from the light inside you,

85
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:15,523
then all these mundane things have no meaning.

86
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:19,692
In the same way, comfort also,

87
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:25,325
in a way, people look for the comfort of the spirit.

88
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:31,100
They don't look for their personal comfort.

89
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,590
See these foreigners.

90
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:39,670
They live in big houses. They have cars and everything.

91
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:43,204
But, they come here and just immerse in this atmosphere.

92
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:46,334
But Indians are not like this.

93
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:53,385
Wherever Indians go, they need attached bathroom,

94
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,869
and all kinds of comforts.

95
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:59,080
Till now they are not able to get over it.

96
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:06,372
I'm astonished that in our poor nation they still have such desires.

97
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,473
It's very astonishing.

98
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,773
People told me Mother please buy a large land for ashram.

99
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,588
Our Indians never live in an ashram.

100
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:22,528
This ashram that we have made with so much of effort,

101
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,998
nobody is ready to live in it.

102
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:29,931
I said I will give you salary for staying, they said no.

103
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,791
My birth place in Chhindwara,

104
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:37,410
we spent so much for that house.

105
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,289
I said those who have retired can stay there,

106
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,945
it has very good climate, it's a hill station. No one was ready.

107
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:48,590
Everybody thinks of their own comfort.

108
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:56,397
It's not so with these people. They live very happily in ashram.

109
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:02,222
My house, my place, my wife,

110
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:07,239
food has to be cooked like this, we will eat this style.

111
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,978
We are entangled in taste.

112
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,444
They are not like this.

113
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,773
They eat Indian food with interest.

114
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:19,978
But I know when Indians come to Cabella,

115
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:26,032
they will bring Indian breads, pickles, etc. with them.

116
00:10:26,517 --> 00:10:33,217
Because they can't get over their tongue. They are stuck in taste.

117
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:41,647
So, until by meditating you don't get rid of these things,

118
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,101
you can't go beyond Dharma.

119
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:53,978
There is a small thing to understand that

120
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:57,427
we lack in sacrifice.

121
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,183
This time they said Mother has bought a huge land, spent so much,

122
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,883
so for puja let's increase the costs.

123
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:13,978
I received so many letters asking me to decrease puja money.

124
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:19,710
Amazing! One time this puja is happening in Delhi.

125
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,598
For that too so many letters about puja money.

126
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,550
They are ready to eat 'paan' (beetle leaf) and throw it

127
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,789
but won't pay puja money.

128
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,037
I have never taken money from you, I have done everything on my own.

129
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,759
But asking for such a small thing...

130
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,745
See today half of the pandal is empty. Why?

131
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,611
Because they don't want to give money for puja.

132
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,826
They phone and ask me to exempt them from puja money

133
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:50,502
Are you in a small job? No, it's not so.

134
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:55,623
"My husband will pay, I won't pay."

135
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:58,668
I'm amazed.

136
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:03,923
If there were a strict guru,

137
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,758
he would shave your heads,

138
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,747
make you wear crimson color cloth and stand upside down on the head.

139
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:18,851
But I don't want this, because it's about being spontaneous.

140
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:22,163
Everything must come in that spontaneity (sahaj).

141
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:25,735
In my life I have seen many sacrificing people.

142
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:29,715
But I don't see it nowadays.

143
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,350
I know about my mother,

144
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:37,995
she would give away her sarees if they increased from six to seven.

145
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:47,034
It's amazing, when they come to Cabella,

146
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:49,385
they need separate room, separate house,

147
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,792
they want to stay separate. Can't stay with others.

148
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:56,763
The person who can't stay with others is not a yogi.

149
00:12:57,414 --> 00:13:01,245
He still thinks "I'm special, I must have special arrangement".

150
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,191
He can't be a sahaja yogi.

151
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,315
He is sahaja yogi by name.

152
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:13,171
The one who is Shiva's disciple must be like Shiva.

153
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:17,200
Wherever you make him sleep, sit, whatever you give him to eat,

154
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:18,819
he doesn't care.

155
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,098
He is not time-bound, no desires. He's like that.

156
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,624
We can say he is a sahaja yogi.

157
00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:30,522
And Shiva's effect will be on you.

158
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:36,368
People do so many things before achieving this.

159
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:41,643
In any other place you go,

160
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:48,031
they will snatch your money, pull your hair, and what not.

161
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:50,833
It's not like this in Sahaja Yoga.

162
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:56,169
But this temperament that we have, we must give it up.

163
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:02,457
We must try to see what things we can give up.

164
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:10,451
Unless this ecstasy comes in you, you can't be Shiva's disciple.

165
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:17,184
Mother has all varieties of disciples, nothing special in it.

166
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:23,256
All types of disciples. Whatever they do, think Mother will forgive.

167
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:28,907
But by forgiving, you will not achieve that state.

168
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:38,503
In forgiving, the most important aspect is to ask Shiva to forgive.

169
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,762
All the time ask for his forgiveness.

170
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:47,398
Because all the time we do a lot of things that we shouldn't do.

171
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:53,371
We have to ask, "Oh Shambho, please forgive us". (Shambho=Shiva)

172
00:14:53,924 --> 00:15:00,708
We make many mistakes. We have many requirements.

173
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,201
We want this and that.

174
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,979
As long as there is 'I want' within us,

175
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,190
until then you have to keep asking for forgiveness from God.

176
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,741
And 'my', 'my house', 'my wife',

177
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:20,984
this kind of authoritative behaviour that we have in us,

178
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:26,429
unless and until we break this we can't be Shiva's disciples.

179
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:32,125
It's astonishing that these foreigners have achieved so much of it.

180
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,190
They had never heard his name.

181
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:37,779
And we people are still stuck,

182
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:41,271
and believe in it (his name only).

183
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,501
Being Shiva means:

184
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:50,790
All these worldly angles in us,

185
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,748
whatever hatred is inside us,

186
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,433
whatever hollowness we have in us,

187
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,258
give them up.

188
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:03,809
But people even after coming to Sahaja Yoga can't see themselves.

189
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:08,519
I heard a mother-in-law is torturing her daughter-in-law.

190
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:12,866
I asked her why she did it. She said "I have not tortured at all".

191
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,736
Amazing!

192
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:20,411
When they go to cinema and see this kind of torturing they cry.

193
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:22,992
But when they come home they torture the daughter-in-law.

194
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:25,537
Or the daughter-in-law tortures her mother-in-law.

195
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:29,595
But they will say they have never tortured anyone.

196
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:36,093
By keeping such lies inside you, you can't progress in Sahaja Yoga.

197
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:40,512
Because this changes your life.

198
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,566
It is your gold.

199
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,038
And gold can't be tarnished.

200
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,966
Nothing can color it.

201
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,714
You have achieved that. Keep that state.

202
00:16:54,915 --> 00:17:01,711
Why to behave like slaves of worldly things now?

203
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:08,765
This is the specialty of kundalini, that she cleans you completely.

204
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:13,788
You should also serve others.

205
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:16,635
But I don't need your service as such.

206
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,227
I'm satisfied; what service can you give me?

207
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:26,809
You should bring that satisfaction and joyfulness in you.

208
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,695
You should think that everything is for enjoying.

209
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:37,082
And if we're enjoying without doing anything, then what's the worry?

210
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:44,232
After thinking a lot, I have come to this conclusion that

211
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:49,032
Sahaja is very .........

212
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,724
And that's why it's so difficult.

213
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:59,940
If someone takes a stick in hand and tells you to shave your hair,

214
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:04,792
wear ........, fast for 14 days,

215
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,457
things will be all done.

216
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:12,083
But Sahaja should be accepted from the heart

217
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:18,342
and the mind,

218
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:23,220
and correct oneself.

219
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:29,002
"Why I'm acting this? Should I behave like this?"

220
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:31,686
Many things will drop out by this.

221
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:35,254
And in a way, you will find yourself.

222
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:39,396
You are self-sufficient and you don't bother about anything,

223
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:43,908
You don't desire anything. Sitting relaxed!

224
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:47,172
And the surprising part is that

225
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:53,688
when Chaitanya knows you don't need anything,

226
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:57,251
it will give you everything.

227
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:01,034
It may be for testing you, may be.

228
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:03,979
Then it will see how you react.

229
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:08,914
There is no need that it can't fulfill.

230
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:13,765
But in this a little dedication is needed.

231
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:21,103
Today, we have invoked Shri Shiva.

232
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,338
But, he likes this type of people.

233
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,602
The difference between him and me is

234
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:33,560
I like all types of people and he doesn't.

235
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:38,948
He likes the people who have left all these worldly things.

236
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:45,336
These are peculiarities in us.

237
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,476
In everything... in wearing clothes...

238
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:52,817
What will happen if we don't wear like that?

239
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:58,572
But, here we don't believe in asceticism.

240
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:01,979
You will become an ascetic from within.

241
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:09,426
When you are ascetic you become desireless and full of joy.

242
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:14,521
Earlier there were Nath (=saint) people.

243
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:18,415
They used to travel around the world.

244
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:22,177
They gave a lot of teachings to the world.

245
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:27,126
I was astonished to know where they had traveled to.

246
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:33,333
When I went to Colombia, I came to know they had been to Bolivia.

247
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:39,753
If you go to Colombia, in airplane you'll feel dizzy; it's so high.

248
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,107
But in those days they used to go on foot.

249
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:48,289
How did they reach there? I don't understand.

250
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:53,922
In Russia and other countries around they have traveled.

251
00:20:54,168 --> 00:21:00,935
How they did it, where they stayed, what they wore; nobody knows.

252
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:09,320
Because you get at the state where you become mysteriously powerful.

253
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,024
For example, we know Sai Nath of Shirdi.

254
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:18,776
He appears anywhere, he can come any time, he can help any one.

255
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:24,500
People tell me "Mother we have seen him". I tell them "Yes why not?"

256
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:27,455
Such people become immortal.

257
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:32,350
Because what can kill them are finished, they become immortal.

258
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,834
Achieving that immortality, is the actual worship of Lord Shiva.

5
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:43,702
I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship -

6
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:46,182
what should happen to you.

7
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,582
But today, I am going to tell you about

8
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:51,302
the internal happening within us

9
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:54,462
when you get your Realization.

10
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:59,782
There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven of them.

11
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:04,262
They are particles, we can say, anshas they call it,

12
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:07,461
of Shiva’s powers.

13
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:13,622
And all of them try to take out

14
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:19,622
or to remove all the false ideas we have about life.

15
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:25,782
When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of them.

16
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:28,102
And, say for example,

17
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:33,062
Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

18
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:39,262
Now, all of them, what they do is to control us

19
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:44,182
from falling into the prey of various things.

20
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:47,102
Like, we have an ego.

21
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:50,782
So, Buddha will look after the ego part.

22
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:56,382
He will see that you get shocked by your ego.

23
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,022
You will be quite amazed

24
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:03,342
how you could be so egoistical,

25
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:08,542
and so insulting, and so humiliating.

26
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:14,582
But when this rudra is not awakened,

27
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:20,461
when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens?

28
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:22,702
You start justifying yourself.

29
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,102
You think whatever you do is correct,

30
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,822
whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said,

31
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:32,342
whatever you have achieved,

32
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,542
you think is your right.

33
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,822
You’ve done nothing wrong.

34
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:43,062
For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

35
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:48,662
On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego,

36
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:52,382
if you go on becoming egoistical,

37
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:56,902
you become absolutely a right-sided personality.

38
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:58,862
Once you are a right-sided personality,

39
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:03,742
you know what all the symptoms there are of such a person.

40
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,542
Now, for that if you just watch

41
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:11,902
and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you,

42
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:15,902
what wrong ideas you had about yourself.

43
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:20,182
So that’s why Mohammed Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

44
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,382
He didn’t know what else to tell.

45
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:29,622
Because this ego business can really burst you,

46
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:35,222
your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

47
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:41,142
Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

48
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:47,382
where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless,

49
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:50,062
cannot move.

50
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,702
Consciously people cannot move.

51
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:57,022
Unconsciously they will, but not consciously.

52
00:24:57,422 --> 00:25:00,622
And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile.

53
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,982
You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.

54
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:07,422
They can’t sit on their own.

55
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:11,302
In a very young age this can happen. This is happening in America.

56
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:14,342
Also, I have seen two, three cases here,

57
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,782
in India, also such a thing happened.

58
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:21,702
So if you do not try to see your ego and control it,

59
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:25,942
and feel repentant about it.

60
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,822
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance,

61
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:30,622
we don’t believe in repentance.

62
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,342
Because we believe that you all have got your Realization,

63
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:39,462
you are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true.

64
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,702
We have to repent.

65
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,942
There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry.

66
00:25:46,182 --> 00:25:47,662
Sorry, for everything they will say sorry.

67
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,902
Even telephone if you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

68
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:53,262
I say, “Sorry, for what?”

69
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:57,262
But this sorry itself is very empty.

70
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:00,782
It has no meaning. It has no depth.

71
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:05,182
When you say “sorry,” you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

72
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:08,022
and what is to be corrected.

73
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:12,461
This is a very big problem of today’s generation

74
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:15,982
where people have developed such tremendous ego-

75
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:19,542
because all our economic growth,

76
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:24,022
all our industrial developments,

77
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:28,022
all our big, big organizations,

78
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:32,862
all of them have given us a way

79
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:35,342
that we should all develop our ego.

80
00:26:35,582 --> 00:26:39,942
If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

81
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,462
And that’s how we start pampering it,

82
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:47,662
and then this right-sided problem starts.

83
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,262
Then as a reaction, it goes to the left side.

84
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,582
Actually, in the head it is on the right side.

85
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:59,142
Here is the right side ego comes up,

86
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:04,102
so the left rudra is that of Mahavira.

87
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:11,022
So people do things, which are sinful,

88
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:16,742
which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

89
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:22,702
Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

90
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,982
He says, “You will go to hell; this will happen,”

91
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,942
he describes all the hell, all kinds of hell,

92
00:27:29,222 --> 00:27:32,262
that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

93
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:36,662
I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

94
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:40,302
But that doesn’t help.

95
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:44,502
So people start getting more onto the left side

96
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:45,862
and, I should say,

97
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:49,662
through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless,

98
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:53,742
then a tremendous depression comes in.

99
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:57,622
One feels very depressed. “Oh God.

100
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:01,862
What a depression I have.  I am so sick.  I am this thing.”

101
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:07,302
And then you try to frighten others with your depressions.

102
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:12,102
You show sort of a, what you call, an emotional blackmail you do.

103
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,461
All kinds of things you will do,

104
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,982
and beat your head and do all kinds of things.

105
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:21,222
Could be through ego, could be through

106
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:29,382
this left side problem of the left rudra.

107
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:32,902
These two rudras are very important

108
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:36,102
because they are directly connected with our

109
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:40,062
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

110
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:41,662
So, it’s very important to see

111
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:46,542
that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras.

112
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:49,742
These rudras are to be satisfied.

113
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:54,862
So to be normal, at least look after these two rudras, which are:

114
00:28:55,062 --> 00:29:00,862
one is the one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

115
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:05,742
“I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

116
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:10,862
All this works out

117
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:15,862
into, physically also, into very serious problems like cancer.

118
00:29:16,182 --> 00:29:19,622
If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer.

119
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:24,422
But all this portion gets swollen up.  It’s called as the medha.

120
00:29:24,702 --> 00:29:26,982
This all portion gets swollen up,

121
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:31,862
and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over.

122
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,062
At least would be here, or maybe there.

123
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:38,662
Because such a swing in the nature of a person

124
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,022
that you can’t say

125
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:44,702
from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

126
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,942
Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come

127
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:52,982
because the rudras have become ineffective.

128
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:59,422
It can be due to the depressive nature

129
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:03,622
or oppressive nature.

130
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:07,142
It could be due to many other factors also.

131
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:10,062
But all these factors are nothing

132
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:17,662
but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s,

133
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:20,862
or Sadashiva’s powers.

134
00:30:21,142 --> 00:30:27,342
He is the one who is full of karuna - full of compassion.

135
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,742
He is the ocean of compassion.

136
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:34,222
If you ask Him forgiveness, He'll forgive.

137
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:39,182
Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

138
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,302
then He forgives.

139
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:44,542
But if you think you, whatever you have done is good,

140
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:49,942
you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,

141
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,942
then it knows.

142
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:56,182
Shiva knows everything, isn’t it?

143
00:30:56,461 --> 00:31:00,102
And, because it knows, it starts giving up.

144
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:06,262
So there’s a big combination of your willpower

145
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:11,102
to be there, and the combination of the blessings of Shiva.

146
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:14,742
When the Shiva blesses you,

147
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:18,102
your willpower also heightens.

148
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:22,422
But you must have full willpower

149
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:24,342
to know that you have

150
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:30,262
to be of a higher level of personality.

151
00:31:31,102 --> 00:31:33,982
He was not at all a mundane type.

152
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:35,502
I mean He was…

153
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:39,342
supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that,

154
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,382
how will He look there?

155
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:43,382
People will laugh at Him.

156
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:44,822
When I met some hippies, I said,

157
00:31:45,022 --> 00:31:47,302
“Why are you having this kind of hair?”

158
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:50,102
So they said, “We want to -” they are all primitive -

159
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,222
so he said, “I want to be primitive.”

160
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,942
I said, “But the brain is modern.

161
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:57,942
What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

162
00:31:58,262 --> 00:32:03,262
So, deception. Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

163
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:06,822
Best thing is to face yourself and understand

164
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:09,782
what wrong you have been doing.

165
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,582
If it works out, I tell you,

166
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:14,582
so many Sahaja Yogis you are sitting here.

167
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:18,222
If you correct yourself and become that

168
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:22,062
I am sure all the problems - political, economic,

169
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:26,102
and all stupid problems we have - will be finished.

170
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:29,461
But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

171
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:35,622
that even the worst people are carrying on.

172
00:32:35,942 --> 00:32:41,062
Now, we have a responsibility to save this world.

173
00:32:41,302 --> 00:32:47,222
We have a responsibility to create a great, honorable life,

174
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:50,582
which is not superficial, which is not just to show off.

175
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:53,382
But inside it should develop

176
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:59,582
so that this light of your spirit spreads

177
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:02,262
and enlightens this world.

178
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,702
It’s very important to understand

179
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,582
all these troubles and these,

180
00:33:06,782 --> 00:33:09,582
I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases,

181
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:14,102
and all other problems which are,in a collective way we can call,

182
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:20,222
of the Kali Yuga like political, economic, all these problems -

183
00:33:20,462 --> 00:33:24,182
only are created by human beings.

184
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,422
They're not created by the Divine Force.

185
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:31,862
But Divine Force tries to neutralize them

186
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,461
if there are many Sahaja Yogis

187
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:40,862
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

188
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:47,382
If that could be done, if that could be achieved,

189
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:52,142
then I think we can do a lot,

190
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:55,461
a lot for the betterment of humanity,

191
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,822
and that’s why we have got realization.

192
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:03,102
It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family,

193
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,342
it’s not only for your city or country,

194
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:10,022
but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

195
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:12,302
Now, if you have to do competition,

196
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:17,382
you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else.

197
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,942
But people are so superficial

198
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:22,822
that they think by showing off

199
00:34:23,022 --> 00:34:26,461
or by becoming something – a big Johnny -

200
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:31,862
they will achieve something of a very great level, is not so.

201
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:38,342
It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also,

202
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,342
so that you understand that whatever you are doing

203
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,222
is for the betterment

204
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:50,222
of global problems.

205
00:34:50,582 --> 00:34:56,182
Absolutely we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine.

206
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:58,382
If I could do it alone, I would have done it.

207
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:01,902
But I can’t, so that’s why I had to gather you all

208
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,142
and to tell you that you become all the channels.

209
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,742
But in the meanwhile, you enjoy.

210
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:13,382
You enjoy life. Every second becomes a joy,

211
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:16,622
which is also the gift of Shiva.

212
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,622
Shiva is the one who creates this

213
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,982
great admiration

214
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:28,422
and great appreciation of every moment,

215
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,702
everything that is there.

216
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:34,022
And that is the state we have to achieve,

217
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:36,382
by not condemning yourself,

218
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:42,582
or not by pampering your ego,

219
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:45,582
but by seeing what you are.

220
00:35:45,862 --> 00:35:49,942
That’s the main thing one has to see, is what problem you have,

221
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:54,262
and what is troubling you is yourself only.

222
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:59,182
If you could just come to that point of understanding,

223
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:02,822
I am sure, I am very, very sure

224
00:36:03,062 --> 00:36:07,542
that you will be such an asset

225
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:13,822
to help to make this world look at itself and change.

226
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:19,302
Because superficially you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

227
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:23,742
And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini

228
00:36:24,022 --> 00:36:29,822
that you can really become a great

229
00:36:30,262 --> 00:36:31,982
torch, I should say,

230
00:36:32,182 --> 00:36:38,102
torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

231
00:36:38,622 --> 00:36:43,542
May God bless you.

232
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:58,902
Today first we'll have a short puja of

233
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,742
Shri Ganesh

234
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,142
and then of Shiva

235
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:04,662
And lastly of the Goddess.

236
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:07,782
We have little bit changed the sequence.
