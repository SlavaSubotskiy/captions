1
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:07,226
﻿Today is the eighth day

2
00:01:07,426 --> 00:01:09,620
of the Devi puja,

3
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:13,339
and on this day,

4
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,580
the power of

5
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,460
Kali acts

6
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,620
and She is the one

7
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,701
called as Samhara Kali,

8
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,157
meaning the one who

9
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:28,747
destroys all the evil forces.

10
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,651
So it is a very good day,

11
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:34,823
that we have a puja here, in England.

12
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:37,032
I am very happy about it.

13
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:39,420
My spectacles?

14
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:43,460
In my purse, I think so.

15
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,440
Where is she? She’s got it?

16
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:51,220
Now,

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,635
I was thinking that I should

18
00:01:56,835 --> 00:02:00,780
talk to the UK Sahaja Yogis, because very important.

19
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,203
I’ll be completing now sixteen years

20
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:07,030
of my stay in UK

21
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:10,818
and I have really found such love and such

22
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:13,100
goodness about you people.

23
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:17,867
Now next year, I will not be

24
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,900
staying here because my husband is going to be transferred

25
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:26,740
and of course and I’ll be coming back

26
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,978
and for a month or so, I could be with you,

27
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,980
maybe much more closer than

28
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,300
I have been so far.

29
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,098
But there’s something that

30
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,620
I think I should warn you people, because now

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,565
I’m receiving lots of letters about Gavin asking,

32
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,060
“Why Gavin has become like that? What’s gone wrong with him?”

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,502
Perhaps everybody seems to quite frightened to see

34
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:56,180
these things happening and to some other Sahaj Yogis also.

35
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,139
Because in other countries, when the

36
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,740
Sahaj Yogis go out of Sahaja Yoga,

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,056
they don’t get after me, or they don’t get after

38
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,218
Sahaja Yoga or Sahaj Yogis.

39
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:10,340
But they think there’s something wrong
with them and they feel very sorry and keep out.

40
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:14,283
But why is it that Gavin has become so adamant and

41
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:17,127
is becoming so much against us?

42
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,450
And I am told he’s supplying

43
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:23,651
information to some horrible organisations and things like that.

44
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,923
I mean I don’t know how to explain human

45
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,443
behaviour. It’s difficult because

46
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,580
when you have found out
something so great and if you cannot value it,

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,200
what happens? Why?

48
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:41,220
So, I feel that

49
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,238
English have so many great qualities among them

50
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,267
because at the time of crisis

51
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,588
they are the ones who have always stood up.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,992
Because of them we could avert the war,

53
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,380
second world war, was averted because of them.

54
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,327
Not only that, but also

55
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,228
they work out things at the

56
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,129
nick of the time,

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,330
whenever it is necessary. And

58
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,060
their whole style is

59
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,042
very quiet

60
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,780
and they show results at the right time,

61
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,825
that’s a fact, no doubt. One has to accept it.

62
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,364
All these qualities are there, but I think there are

63
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,826
certain other things which have crawled up and

64
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:30,641
maybe that’s one of the reasons we have to guard against,

65
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,261
if you have to keep to Sahaja Yoga,

66
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:34,098
if you have to grow in Sahaja Yog.

67
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,252
So one of the things I have found out that

68
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:42,540
English believe more in the style,

69
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,401
what your style is.

70
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:51,064
Say, like a cocktail style,

71
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,701
you can call it, or a dandy style

72
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:57,754
then a punk style and this style and that style.

73
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,740
You have got tailcoat style.

74
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,900
All sorts of styles here, they say.

75
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:07,265
And because too much of it, in the atmosphere, too much.

76
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,399
As soon as you see a house they’ll tell you,

77
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,535
“Oh, this is Georgian!”

78
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,174
“This is

79
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,742
such and such,” and “This is Neo this and that!”

80
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:21,727
So, you see, it must go up to that style,

81
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:23,860
it has to be that style.

82
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,947
And any house

83
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:30,261
which is not to that style,

84
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,790
then they’ll say, “Oh, it’s a compromise!”

85
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,712
It's a little,

86
00:05:35,657 --> 00:05:37,487
it's a little fussy or I don’t know

87
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,180
what all words they use to criticise such a thing.

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,853
So this is one thing we have to know that styles

89
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,500
cannot substitute the content.

90
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,740
It cannot be a substitute.

91
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:51,486
Style is so outward

92
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,545
and so,

93
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,778
so deceptive.

94
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,636
It is so deceptive and so outward

95
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,900
that it deceives us also.

96
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,250
It deceives us also.

97
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:09,184
Like, if we feel that we are a class,

98
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:12,620
or something, there’s class consciousness also quite a lot.

99
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,203
If we start thinking, we are class.

100
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,138
Then I mean, one has to know that

101
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,470
this is something very man made stuff

102
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,340
— to be a class.

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,255
If you say, “I am a class.” That means it’s all man made.

104
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,907
It’s not the way the Divine is.

105
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,805
Divine doesn’t have all these

106
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:32,540
differentiations.

107
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,740
You are a class Sahaja Yogi, means in your content,

108
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:40,660
within yourself, you have such powers;

109
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:45,500
that you can face yourself happily and you enjoy yourself,

110
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,413
and you know yourself.

111
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,780
That is what is a class in Sahaj Yoga,

112
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,220
not how you dress up or how you talk

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,380
of you hold your fork and spoon — it’s not the way.

114
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,380
So this style

115
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,220
that we think of is no substitute for the contents.

116
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:08,046
Now this thing works out better with this

117
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,540
outside culture that we have,

118
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,566
that you should not express your feelings.

119
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,300
This is another nonsense they have taught us,

120
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,940
in this country, which is all nonsense, absolute nonsense

121
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,467
— you should not express your feelings and

122
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,605
you should be poised.

123
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,226
And

124
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,979
say somebody's dead,

125
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,883
somebody died, in our friend, I mean in our circle,

126
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:36,588
and Mr. Shrivastava went there. Thank God,

127
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:40,062
I had no black sari so I didn’t go! But you must go in the black sari,

128
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,940
and black blouse

129
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,105
and black everything and the black bangles and I said,

130
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:49,300
“Baba, I don’t have all these black,
black things, so what to do?” So I didn’t go.

131
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:52,140
I mean what is there? A person is dead now,

132
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,780
he doesn’t see you whether you’re in black or red, you see?

133
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,700
But one thing is there, definitely,

134
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,398
that if you wear something, you see.

135
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:06,885
Whatever you wear, you express the inside,

136
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,540
the content within you, that you’re so sad and unhappy.

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,844
And then he went and

138
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,140
there was a champagne for that!

139
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,875
I mean, somebody is born you have a champagne

140
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,117
somebody dies you have a champagne, I mean anyway.

141
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,685
So champagne has nothing to do with the style,

142
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,687
they can have at any time.

143
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:29,900
But the style was, you must wear black, everything black.

144
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:32,660
I said, “This is too much!” I mean

145
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,860
at the most one could have some strip of black to suggest.

146
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,540
But what is there to suggest, if somebody is dead?

147
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,878
I mean you do feel inside. And he was looking very sick,

148
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,226
my husband was looking very sick, because

149
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:48,977
he was feeling so sad really that he had lost a friend.

150
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,677
I also cried.

151
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,541
So they said, “What’s the matter, are you not well?”

152
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,318
They were all laughing, joking,

153
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:59,418
and the dead body was lying in the next room!

154
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,553
So C.P. said, “No, but such a friend!”

155
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:07,296
“Oh! Be poised! You have no poise, Mr Srivastava!”

156
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,798
And one lady had gone, whom

157
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,756
she’s also our common friend,

158
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,060
she’s from, I think, Ghana or some place,

159
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,420
and she started crying, you know,

160
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:20,249
naturally. I would have also have also cried, thank God I didn’t go.

161
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,340
So they all criticised her,

162
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:27,020
“This is not proper, she should not 
have done all this things,” and all that.

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,178
So all these ideas, you see,

164
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:32,831
every country has some sort of a conditioning

165
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,940
and we must realise what our conditionings are.

166
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,114
Then we are all right. Because we have to
break all our conditionings in every country.

167
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,867
The best thing about Sahaja Yogis
is that once they become a Sahaja Yogi,

168
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,295
they see the problems of their own country.

169
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,580
This is the best thing we have.

170
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,740
And they laugh at the people who are there.

171
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,526
But still we must know there might
be some subtle things lying within us,

172
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:57,940
because from this case of Gavin, now you can see clearly.

173
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:01,220
You see, he had a style, always he had a style for everything:

174
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,923
for puja he’ll have a style,

175
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,946
this thing he’ll have a style, that thing he’ll have style.

176
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,751
So I used to little bit doubt him. I said,

177
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:11,701
“Why is he’s so much worried about his style?”

178
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,075
For small, small things. Even if he’ll wear

179
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,645
an Indian dress, he will think of a style,

180
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,906
what style it is. I said, “You see, we don’t have any styles.

181
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,218
This, we have been wearing from ages! Now,

182
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,060
what style can we have?

183
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,700
We don’t have Georgian, this, that style at all.

184
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,790
It’s only one style, is kurta — that’s all.”

185
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:33,757
So like that, you see,

186
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:37,070
he was more worried about the style he would put up.

187
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,179
And that’s what I am saying,

188
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,868
that we have to understand

189
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:46,068
that style cannot substitute your content.

190
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:49,660
Be careful.

191
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,493
So now not to express your feelings,

192
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,460
you shouldn’t laugh

193
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,860
you should sit like a monk.

194
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,020
We don’t want monks here, all right?

195
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,799
You have to really laugh aloud

196
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,547
and enjoy

197
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,865
and show your expression of your enjoyment.

198
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,620
If you cannot laugh it out, if you do not know

199
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,820
how to enjoy your Spirit, you are
not a Sahaja Yogi, finished! That’s all.

200
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,044
If you are a Sahaj Yogi, then you
should be able to enjoy everything,

201
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:25,860
every small thing you should enjoy.

202
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:30,144
Once we climbed a

203
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:33,540
hill to go to a temple to see it. It was an old temple,

204
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,106
we went to see that and we had to climb quite a lot.

205
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,583
My son in law, my daughter, they were exhausted,

206
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:41,267
but I was enjoying everything. I didn’t feel anything.

207
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,980
I went up and then I just

208
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,580
- we all laid down there,

209
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,547
in one of the outer sides of the temples. And

210
00:11:50,008 --> 00:11:52,740
he said, “I’m fed up of this,” my son in law said,

211
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,660
“it’s too much to climb this.”

212
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,820
I said, “Now watch these elephants,
see these elephants are so nicely done!

213
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,421
Everybody has a different type of a tail!”

214
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:05,562
He said, “Mummy how can you see tails at this time at this time

215
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,460
when I’m so exhausted?”

216
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,569
I said, “That’s how I don’t get exhausted!

217
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:11,620
But you can see the tails, there are

218
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,231
different, different types!” He said, “Just now I cannot”.

219
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:18,020
I said, “You start seeing them,
 you’ll forget it.” And really it happened.

220
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,980
So one thing is:

221
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,883
we are not any more English,

222
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,740
or UK Sahaja Yogis, we are Sahaja Yogis of the God’s Kingdom.

223
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,395
And we know what is the truth.

224
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,476
And we are not going to make
ourselves miserable for nothing at all,

225
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,819
because some of our great grandfathers

226
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,939
have told us to put things like this,

227
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,489
that you have not to express your feelings.

228
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:48,822
But it was not so bad I must tell you when I first came,

229
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,660
when I gave Realisation to Douglas.

230
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,703
If you see him, he’ll remember. You see, he lost all balance,

231
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:57,963
he just picked me up and put me up like that.

232
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,860
And I felt that English have improved a lot!

233
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:09,662
But Gregoire was there, he got nervous,

234
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,486
“Put Her down! Put Her down!”

235
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:18,466
So it was so simple, so spontaneous,

236
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,500
so natural, you know.

237
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:25,500
That is what we should understand: Are we natural?

238
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:28,726
Are we spontaneous? Do we laugh a lot?

239
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,399
Do we talk in a very

240
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,305
open way?

241
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:40,379
To be open hearted is wrong according to the old stupid

242
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,900
traditions what you must have had.

243
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,808
It’s wrong, absolutely wrong I tell you!

244
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:49,980
So this is one of the things we must cut out that

245
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,325
we have no other styles, but Sahaja Yoga style is to laugh,

246
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:56,409
to talk to embrace everyone and to

247
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,691
be joyous.

248
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,899
That’s what we are.

249
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,619
Because we know the knowledge, we are gnostics,

250
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,020
they are not stupid blind people,

251
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,386
who would wear their,

252
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,980
black hats to go to church

253
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,793
and sit over all the tombs there.

254
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,340
We know such a lot.

255
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,260
So this is first thing that we have no styles,

256
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,860
no styles of any kind.

257
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:28,220
Now some Sahaja Yogis went abroad got married,

258
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,030
from UK and I have complaints about them,

259
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,820
that they think they have become ladies and ladas.

260
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,188
I said, “Eh? Ladies and ladas?

261
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:38,247
They have had no jobs here,

262
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:41,100
how have they become ladies? They said, “They have.

263
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,063
Now they want to wear a kind of a hat

264
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,995
and they want to wear this kind of a thing and

265
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,220
some of them have become hippies!”

266
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,340
I said, “Hippies, why? I can’t understand!”

267
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,020
“And they don’t want to talk to anyone

268
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,060
and they are stiff upper lip.”

269
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:00,780
All English styles, you see!

270
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,856
I said, “I hope they are not wearing tail coats

271
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:08,127
borrowed from this Moss Bros.”

272
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:16,420
So it was very

273
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,366
sad because they would not go to any collective programmes,

274
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:22,479
they would not, because, you know,
they have become now sahibs, you see!

275
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,703
In India, they are called as sahibs.

276
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:28,540
In India, if somebody tries to show too much style

277
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,341
or tries to show that he’s some class,

278
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,540
“Ha! Now he’s become a sahib! He’s become a sahib!”

279
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:38,603
Sahib means, it’s condemnation. In India it is condemnation.

280
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:42,013
But that’s what it is. It’s come from English only,

281
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:45,724
because English would talk like that; sometimes

282
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,657
in such a manner that,

283
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,626
even he might be just a butler somewhere,

284
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,780
but he would talk with such a big airs about him.

285
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,185
But you are not that.

286
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:00,835
And we have been thinking why,

287
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:03,963
why is it, that the English cannot open their hearts?

288
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,263
After all, you live on the heart of the whole universe!

289
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:12,550
I mean, if you don’t open your hearts
who else is going to open their hearts?

290
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,445
There’s no need to be vivacious, you see,

291
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,843
talking like this, talking like that, 
it’s not needed, I am not saying that,

292
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:21,398
that, please understand.

293
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:24,478
But I am saying, in a proper dignified manner,

294
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:28,384
you have to laugh, you have to joke, you have to enjoy.

295
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,624
Because there’s no joy inside that’s why it is so.

296
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,460
Is it not? Or is there joy?

297
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:40,397
And still you think, “If I laugh too much, what will people say?”

298
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:48,092
So, this is one thing one has to understand: that all these artificialities

299
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:51,635
are all stupid artificialities that were there.

300
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:54,096
Like at the time

301
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,470
you go to one of the queens parties

302
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,620
— I must tell you about it because I’ve been to all this nonsense

303
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,580
— and

304
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:04,312
there are people who come in there,

305
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,702
of course this Moss Bros. business again,

306
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,545
they come in their tailcoats.

307
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,053
And some get very

308
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:15,500
tight ones and some get very loose ones, you see!

309
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,900
The tight ones walk with such a funny gait, you don’t know

310
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,015
what to do, you feel like laughing all the time

311
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,740
and they look like jokers, I tell you.

312
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:26,261
Very nice dignified people look like jokers.

313
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:27,901
And the others who have

314
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,865
loose ones walk like Charlie Chaplin.

315
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,043
And I can never make them out,

316
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,617
I tell you, I told CP, “Is he the same?”

317
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,183
“Yes, he’s the same why?”, “I can’t make him out,

318
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,134
he’s looking so different like Charlie Chaplin!”

319
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:46,700
Might be, Charlie Chaplin might
have been to one of these such parties,

320
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,540
I am sure, the way he had his dress made.

321
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,460
Because this is absolutely there, I tell you.

322
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,433
And then, they must have the tea, sit down,

323
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,720
this, that nonsense, you see.

324
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:02,882
What I am saying that all this trickles down to us

325
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,044
from a man-made nonsensical idea.

326
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:09,980
We are sitting

327
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,609
in the Kingdom of God.

328
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,300
So we are not going to do all these things.

329
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,434
We are not going to indulge into all such nonsensical things,

330
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:30,478
because it gives such an artificial superiority

331
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:33,568
and cuts you off from the rest of the world.

332
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,180
So I have to

333
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,177
really tell you that,

334
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,489
in this whatever has happened that the

335
00:18:49,926 --> 00:18:52,420
kind of artificiality

336
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,337
that was built up,

337
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,860
the reality had to give up.

338
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:02,420
It couldn’t bear any more of that artificiality,

339
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,324
it was too much.

340
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,460
Now I'm trying to find

341
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,560
out why this difference like I have seen Jeremy and Robert,

342
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,780
they have become real Italians, I tell you.

343
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,323
So once, we had gone for shopping and then we said,

344
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,830
“Let’s have some ice cream!”
Guido is very good at taking me to ice cream shops,

345
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,180
because I never eat otherwise!

346
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,803
So we were there and suddenly we heard a big laughter coming.

347
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,870
I said, “Looks like some Sahaja Yogis coming this side.”

348
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,443
It was Baba Mama and these two

349
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,582
coming down to the same shop,

350
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:42,689
and laughing so loudly, that even the

351
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:48,337
Italians were looking at them that,

352
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,073
“Who are these greater Italians who have come here?”

353
00:19:51,964 --> 00:19:54,340
Three of them laughing and laughing!

354
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,001
And they very quickly saw us and
they got a fright, because they were sitting.

355
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,272
I said, “I am so happy to hear your laughter. All the way you came

356
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,540
here and everybody was looking at you.”

357
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,722
Because both of them know Italian language,

358
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:08,910
they know another language.

359
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,903
There’s another thing with us is that we don’t

360
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:14,748
want to learn any other language.

361
00:20:14,949 --> 00:20:18,318
Everyone will have to jolly well learn English language,

362
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,206
otherwise we think they are all stupid fools.

363
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,387
And we make fun of them.

364
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,504
I have seen so many films here — they show so many

365
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:29,539
little, little dramas sometimes some sort of series coming

366
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,054
— where the show a French

367
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:33,365
speaking English in a funny way,

368
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,638
or a German speaking in a funny way.

369
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:37,890
And also I think English can

370
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,220
speak in quite a funny way

371
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,634
to me! Sometimes,

372
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,904
it’s impossible.

373
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,464
Like today, the ticket collector I don’t know what language he spoke,

374
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:53,293
but I didn’t understand what he
was talking, he was trying to be nice.

375
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,558
But I was looking at him, I was about to ask him,

376
00:20:55,758 --> 00:20:58,820
“Now, what Oxford English, or is it Cambridge English?

377
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:00,663
I don’t understand.”

378
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,031
That’s how. So what I am saying

379
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:05,740
that language is just for communication.

380
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,703
But in the communication, if there’s no love,

381
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:12,354
if there’s no genuineness, if there’s no feeling, concern,

382
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,460
why do we want to communicate with anyone?

383
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,480
Just a lip service,

384
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,644
no good.

385
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,256
So now we are not only

386
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,541
part and parcel

387
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:33,260
of this world but of the whole.

388
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,965
And everything circulates through you once you

389
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:40,921
give up this insular feeling.

390
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,955
But insulation is there, very much insulation,

391
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,454
in the character, maybe because

392
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:48,156
of England being an island.

393
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,170
Except, as I was telling

394
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,460
today to David, that except for

395
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,700
attacking other people and going into up to even China

396
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,900
up to Australia, otherwise they are insulated!

397
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:04,253
So we must learn to watch ourselves,

398
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:06,220
we must learn

399
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,259
what is coming to us from our forefathers.

400
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,740
This is the inheritance we have got!

401
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,220
So suddenly we become lords,

402
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,100
suddenly we become ladies,

403
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:26,028
suddenly we become some sort of an

404
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:27,835
English duke.

405
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:32,900
In India they made a lot of fun. You must 
have seen the dukes nose they have got it,

406
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,754
given the name to

407
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,340
one projection of a mountain,

408
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,023
they call it, “This is a dukes nose,”

409
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:43,491
because some duke must have gone with a nose like that.

410
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:51,260
So we must learn to make fun of ourselves.

411
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:54,220
Then all these things will disappear,

412
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,180
and must understand that

413
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,340
we are much higher people than this limited thing.

414
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,860
It’s no good.

415
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:04,233
And if we are following these old people

416
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,385
then we can become bhootish with
them, because they were quite bhoots,

417
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,428
can see them, they were quite bhoots, the way

418
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:11,260
they did certain things.

419
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,910
And now they are dead and gone,

420
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,700
we are newly born, special people,

421
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,500
we are flowers

422
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:19,843
and we should be fragrant.

423
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:23,100
And this is what happened with Gavin is that

424
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,650
he’s gone down too much. And

425
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:27,499
this Valerie is a character which is another horrible one.

426
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:31,044
I just don’t know what to say about her — the less said the better.

427
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:34,476
I mean I have never seen such a
person writing such a horrible thing,

428
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:37,986
I have never heard that such books are written

429
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,147
for general reading.

430
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:43,100
I mean in India out of question!

431
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,116
Even one sentence like that wont be permitted.

432
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,060
Something that’s nauseating, absolutely nauseating.

433
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,531
I couldn’t read of course, I am sorry to say but

434
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:55,500
whatever I heard about it. And there were a few lines, they read it

435
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,952
and I said, “Baba! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! I don’t want to vomit!”

436
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:05,780
So to just to have a style and this and that,

437
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,619
it is not all right.

438
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,220
We are the Spirit

439
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:15,660
and the Spirit is the light,

440
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,100
light all around us,

441
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,195
all around our auras.

442
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:23,883
There are people walking with a special

443
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,001
type of a personality,

444
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,500
what do we need style for?

445
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,883
Who has better style than ours?

446
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,420
We make our own styles,

447
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,718
we are the makers of styles.

448
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:43,883
So to conform to some sort of a nonsensical idea

449
00:24:44,084 --> 00:24:47,180
and to secede yourself,

450
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,700
to separate yourself, to cut yourself

451
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,447
from the collective, is nonsensical.

452
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:57,124
Now this time, those who are going
to India, I have to tell you one thing:

453
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:00,326
that you must get mixed up with people.

454
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:02,855
We’ll not have any camp which will have

455
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,193
only English or this.

456
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,016
And it’s a very common failing,

457
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,961
we must face it. It’s a very common failing.
Because now, I’m in England, so I’m also English,

458
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,220
but I don’t have this failing in me.

459
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:17,220
But I have seen Indians, when they live here, they become like this.

460
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,005
I went to a place

461
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:24,755
called Mar del Plata in Argentina.

462
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,671
It’s a very beautiful place, very beautiful colony of people.

463
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:30,761
So I said, “Who are these people living here?”

464
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,163
They said; “All Spanish,

465
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:35,178
Italians, this, that.” “And English?”,

466
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:38,620
“No! English have a separate colony of theirs.”

467
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,020
But I wouldn’t be surprised tomorrow we have

468
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,975
a separate colony of the English Indians;

469
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:46,808
could be.

470
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,310
They say in Sanskrit, “Sangati sanga doshena,”

471
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,743
means, if you live with somebody, you become like that.

472
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:54,677
So we might have some dukes and duchesses in the

473
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:58,487
Indian community also possibly tomorrow if they live here

474
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,592
— quite possible.

475
00:26:01,944 --> 00:26:03,587
This is such a,

476
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,319
such a

477
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:10,340
atmosphere, charged,

478
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:14,260
“We are something special.”

479
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:19,252
And it shows so clearly when they do to another country,

480
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,420
it creates problems.

481
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,412
They cannot mix up with people,

482
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,435
they cannot talk to others,

483
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:28,060
all the time

484
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,260
they think they are like some media people, trying to criticise.

485
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:37,299
The whole attitude is that

486
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,116
we have to get mixed up with the whole ocean of Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:44,439
Instead of that, if you

488
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,540
behave like that, people think they

489
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,660
are sort of

490
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,340
criticising us.

491
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,218
That’s why I have said many a times that we cannot use the word

492
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,820
“I like” or “I believe”.

493
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:03,340
No, not to use.

494
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,105
Because that is how you despise others

495
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:08,019
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

496
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:12,018
You may not even have half of this in the house, your own

497
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:14,002
but they will say like that.

498
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:17,226
You may not have food in the house to eat
but when they go to somebody’s house, they say,

499
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,105
“I don’t like this food.”

500
00:27:20,086 --> 00:27:21,940
That we don’t have to have.

501
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:26,633
All these things I have seen in him and that’s what I am telling you.

502
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:33,420
Of course there are many books to read and we can.

503
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,893
One good quality about English is that they are scholarly,

504
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:39,380
they have scholarship. They read a lot, they know a lot.

505
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,403
Ordinary person will also know.

506
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:44,500
Also it being a very small country, they know about

507
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,980
little, little places. You go anywhere they know,

508
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,260
“This glass is from Darlington,

509
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,740
this is from here,

510
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,619
that is from there.” Indians wouldn’t know anything!

511
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,940
And if you ask them, “This sari comes from where?”

512
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,171
Men, especially, women may tell you.

513
00:27:59,371 --> 00:28:01,734
Women will say, “I don’t know, must be from India

514
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:04,434
is it? Or is it from Kenya?”

515
00:28:08,615 --> 00:28:11,251
They know about birds, about from where they come.

516
00:28:11,451 --> 00:28:12,958
But all these things, you see,

517
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,754
this knowledge sometimes can make us

518
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,825
over nationalistic:

519
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:20,060
“We the British!”

520
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:22,004
It can come.

521
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:24,140
Be careful on that point,

522
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,487
to say, “We are the British.”

523
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,596
We are not!

524
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,500
We are not Indians, we are not British, we are nothing.

525
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,020
We are gnostics.

526
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,403
We are the ones who know. We are Yogis.

527
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:43,346
Because this is such an artificial ego in our head

528
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:46,893
and that has made people hate us,

529
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,311
while we are here to love the whole world.

530
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:59,460
So our beauty lies in

531
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,220
how much we love others.

532
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:06,771
We must face ourselves, see:

533
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,540
“How much do we love,

534
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,283
others?

535
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:15,722
How much do we care for others?

536
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:20,121
How much do we enjoy others?

537
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:24,659
How do I feel when I face another Sahaja Yogi?”

538
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:27,794
When I see you, a ripple

539
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:31,179
of joy becomes like a thunder to me.

540
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:33,015
I mean, I don’t know where I stand.

541
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:36,820
And sometimes I feel I might just raise myself up in the heaven!

542
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:44,420
That is the content within us of our Spirit.

543
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:47,460
Not all these artificial things,

544
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,540
they can never give us joy.

545
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,135
They cannot give joy to anybody else.

546
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,306
We have to be very simple people.

547
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,500
Simple doesn’t mean that

548
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,632
you should just wear some little few clothes, it doesn’t mean that.

549
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:05,668
Simple, means from your heart.

550
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,540
For small, small things you should feel happy.

551
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,420
Simple things should make you happy.

552
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:18,540
And that is how

553
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:22,106
we’ll get closer to each other.

554
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,700
Because this world has to be one.

555
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,826
Now when it will be one Europe,

556
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:29,820
what’s going happen to English I don’t know.

557
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:36,180
They’ll have to jump in the sea I think because the way they will be

558
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,309
encroached by all these people because

559
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,955
they are in a way,

560
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,374
in an English way, they are aggressive people, because

561
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:50,373
if an Italian is there, he’ll just walk into your house

562
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:52,787
and say, “What have you got for today’s dinner?”

563
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:55,700
Quite possible! And you say, “What’s this?

564
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,193
It’s very unmannerly to walk in my house!”

565
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,498
Why do you have a house?

566
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:04,796
Even a rat cannot walk into that house.

567
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:06,821
You polish your,

568
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:09,003
brass, you

569
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,396
do all your cleanings, sweepings — for whom?

570
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,278
There’s not even a rat

571
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:16,940
in the house to come and see it.

572
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:21,406
What’s the use of doing all this? Live like

573
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,994
pigs then, better is that not to waste energy.

574
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:25,702
Because there’s not even a,

575
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:28,900
even a pig to come and see you!

576
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:34,217
All right the climate is such,

577
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,660
we can’t leave the doors open, all right,

578
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,740
but hearts can be open.

579
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:44,660
I have had lots of experiences of this myself.

580
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,598
But in Sahaja Yoga, if it crawls up,

581
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,500
then I don’t think our Sahaja Yoga can prosper,

582
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,977
or people can have that content.

583
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,643
The quality of Sahaja Yoga should be within us:

584
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:57,034
how many people we give Realisation?

585
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,947
How many people we can talk to?

586
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:01,492
How much do we know about Sahaja Yoga?

587
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,146
How much we have mastered it,

588
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,137
how many people

589
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:10,220
we get into Sahaja Yoga?

590
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,600
Can we?

591
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:19,752
It’s the circulation of the heart

592
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,179
that is important.

593
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:26,297
And if you cannot circulate why are you living on the heart?

594
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:28,904
This is the

595
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,643
country of heart

596
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:32,300
where Shiva lives,

597
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,317
where He is pulsating in everything

598
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:37,275
— is pulsating in everything

599
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:39,638
— and there where you are there,

600
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,939
then what you should do?

601
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:50,980
Circulation:

602
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,420
how much you can circulate,

603
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,660
articulate with people,

604
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,274
rapport,

605
00:32:58,742 --> 00:33:02,352
understanding. Everywhere there’s joy,

606
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:06,271
everywhere there’s understanding. Such

607
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:12,032
oceans of depths people have

608
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:14,758
but we must know how to penetrate into them.

609
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,515
But if you want to have the pearls, you have to dive down.

610
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:21,766
But if you want to live with the straw it is hanging there

611
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,038
on the surface — live with it!

612
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:31,420
We have come to Sahaja Yoga to become great people.

613
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:35,260
We have been British, all right finished now, done!

614
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,279
But now we had a second birth,

615
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,493
we have entered into the Kingdom of God,

616
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:42,060
now we are here to become great people,

617
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,060
great monarchs.

618
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,500
And these styles and all this have come

619
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,191
from the so-called monarchs and kings

620
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:53,651
and horrible people they were! Do you know that?

621
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:56,695
They told me that Queen Elizabeth,

622
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,992
the first one, had a kind of a funny patch here,

623
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:03,690
they don’t know if she was a man or a woman, or whatever it is,

624
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,500
whatever she was, man or a woman, or a person,

625
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,940
this was the thing, she had a patch here.

626
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,230
That’s why she made this

627
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:12,980
kind of a collar

628
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,220
for her which was standing here.

629
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:18,740
And everybody had to wear that!

630
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:23,537
And they said about Victoria also

631
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:26,820
I don’t want to say anything against
her because I have great respect for her

632
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,323
but they say she developed a hump on the back so she

633
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:32,898
developed these Victorian skirts.

634
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:40,293
So also you can see that hippyism started in England,

635
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,300
punkism started in England.

636
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:47,749
Imagine the punks! They are mad!

637
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:51,336
And when I went to an

638
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:54,556
exhibition in a

639
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:57,329
Rome,

640
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,523
beautiful exhibition it was,

641
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,723
we were passing from one country
to another country, to another country,

642
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:06,237
and there,

643
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,573
I thought of England, because I
have become English as I told you.

644
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,573
He said, “Where is UK?” He said, “It’s there!”

645
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:14,221
And there were about six, seven

646
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,910
boys from,

647
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,664
mostly from Italy, and three, four girls laughing, “Ha! Ha!”

648
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:23,389
I said, “What’s happening there? What’s the matter?

649
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,005
Why are they laughing at the English,
when the English laugh at everyone?”

650
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:30,141
And you know what was that? It was a punk shop

651
00:35:30,341 --> 00:35:33,841
— that’s the only thing they had for exhibition, believe me.

652
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:36,300
Holey pants,

653
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,100
holey, H O L E Y !

654
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:44,788
Holey pants and they had these

655
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:46,986
— what you call them,

656
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,260
what do you call I don’t know that?

657
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,140
We call toora in Hindi language

658
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,980
that kind of thing — and all that, they were selling there.

659
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:59,624
And they said, “It’s all genuine, genuine,

660
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,980
genuine from England.”

661
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:05,918
And all of these Italians were laughing.

662
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,740
So I asked Flavia, “Why are they laughing at these British?”

663
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:13,130
He said, “Mother, we have a sense of ridicule,

664
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,540
we have a great sense of ridicule.”

665
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:18,780
While these people were thinking, “So what?

666
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,180
What’s wrong? If I cut my nose what’s wrong?”

667
00:36:23,928 --> 00:36:25,980
So ultimately we end up into this

668
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,940
kind of a stupidity, as you know,

669
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,780
that a person who has this kind of an ego becomes an idiot.

670
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:42,071
And there are many things which you can see clearly how,

671
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:44,995
how we thought that we were something great

672
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:47,580
and how people befooled us.

673
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:50,180
There’s a great writer in

674
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,340
Hindi language called as Premchand.

675
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,820
I must tell you his story it’s very interesting.

676
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,340
We had English in India and we knew

677
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,540
how to befool them, I must tell you, frankly.

678
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,020
And there were two Englishmen

679
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,340
going in a Benares street.

680
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:11,060
And mostly in Benares, they have their WCs on top in the open.

681
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,260
They sit there. And they had a,

682
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,780
- we carry our

683
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,108
jar, lota, they call it lota

684
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,466
with the water.

685
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,945
Somebody put the lota there,

686
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:28,580
and suddenly, with some sort of a thing, it fell down.

687
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,864
And it just fell down

688
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,366
— are you recording me?

689
00:37:33,567 --> 00:37:36,140
Hello? Now don’t record this.

690
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:38,700
You want to record it?

691
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:41,852
Only for English all right.

692
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,252
But don’t give it to anybody else!

693
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:49,818
So the lota fell down and fell down.

694
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:53,334
And he describes, “Fell on the feet

695
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,494
of those where many

696
00:37:55,694 --> 00:37:58,323
Indians go and put there heads.”

697
00:37:58,523 --> 00:37:59,938
So I said, “What that must be?”

698
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:02,819
They were the feet of two Englishmen.

699
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,069
And then the Englishmen got angry,

700
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:08,940
because according to their country’s law nothing can be hurt.

701
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,420
And they took the lota they said,
 “We are taking you to the police now.

702
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:15,048
This has hurt us so much!”

703
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,860
So, you see,

704
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,533
the man who was upstairs came running,

705
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,845
said, “Sorry, sorry!” He said, “Nothing doing,

706
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:26,117
we are going to take you to the police! It has hurt us.

707
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:29,660
You had no business to keep a lota there that it fell on our feet.”

708
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,580
In India, nobody compensates.

709
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,567
But if an Englishman comes and says, all right,

710
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,154
they’ll say, “Baba, it’s all right, what to do?”

711
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,672
So there was one fellow who thought of a trick.

712
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:45,793
So he knew English. He said, “See,

713
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:49,420
you can take them to police. 
At most police will fine them a little bit.

714
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,083
But do you know this lota?” He said, “What?”

715
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:55,145
“This lota belonged to Akbar.

716
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:58,131
Akbar used to carry this lota with him,

717
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:02,197
so instead of taking them if you ask for this lota

718
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:05,291
will be a good idea its an antique piece you see.

719
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,083
Will be good for you

720
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,935
Akbar the great used to take this!”

721
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:13,863
And he told in Hindi language to them that,

722
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,610
“I have befooled them and I have told then

723
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,540
this belonged to Akbar and you just say

724
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,891
that ‘We don’t want to give this lota and you can take us to police!’

725
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:23,795
So they said, “Now, all right.

726
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:27,131
If you give us this lota, then we’ll forgive you!”

727
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,251
So these people said, “No we don’t want to give this lota.”

728
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,190
“Why?” “Because it belonged to Akbar!

729
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:37,058
How can we give such a lota? He was our forefather.

730
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,580
We can’t give our lota to you!”

731
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,791
So then the English said, “All right,

732
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,941
then are you willing to come to police?”
“Yes, yes, we are willing to come to police

733
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:47,700
but we can’t give you this lota!”

734
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:51,620
So they paid lot of money for that lota and bought it.

735
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:01,016
And they were very proud, you see.

736
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:04,647
And they took that lota and they must have put it in some frame

737
00:40:04,847 --> 00:40:08,847
to say that this is was the lota which was carried by Akbar.

738
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,393
So this is how it is.

739
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,809
So first we must have respect for

740
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,090
other cultures, other things and other people

741
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,948
and other countries and try to

742
00:40:20,148 --> 00:40:22,760
see what they have good about them.

743
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:26,831
Otherwise nothing will penetrate into you

744
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:30,411
and you will be left high and dry all your life.

745
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:33,386
There’s so many nice things in this world.

746
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:37,180
Say you go to Italy — see the beautiful

747
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,500
work they do, the furniture they make,

748
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,811
things they make. Once they come to

749
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,631
England I don’t know what’s going to happen to us.

750
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,777
We had lots of beautiful

751
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:52,036
art and we had talents, but all finished now, nobody is having that.

752
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,102
And when they come here what is going to happen?

753
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,740
In machinery, when the Germans come here,

754
00:40:58,082 --> 00:40:59,768
they’ll finish us off.

755
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,481
So we have to realise that these outside things and

756
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:08,528
thinking that we are something great, is not greatness.

757
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:12,460
Greatness is within yourself, within your heart.

758
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,620
And it is so much,

759
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,193
so much evident, so much evident here,

760
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,780
that it’s really shocking.

761
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,180
As a reaction to all that

762
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,100
formalities and all that, people might have taken to

763
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,053
very casual dresses, all right.

764
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:41,019
But that’s not the way, because from inside it has to go.

765
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:43,728
All these ideas have to

766
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:47,207
be washed off completely, cleaned off.

767
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,780
And we have to know that

768
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,540
we are the ones, we have to give light of the Spirit

769
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,460
to the whole world.

770
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,511
And how can we cover and

771
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:00,447
cloud ourselves with all these funny ideas?

772
00:42:01,136 --> 00:42:05,060
And that’s why so many of you, 
you have asked me questions about Gavin.

773
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,340
Only thing I have to say that,

774
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:10,660
to this extent, only an Englishman can go

775
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,980
because he can forgive himself.

776
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:16,343
To this extent nobody else can go.

777
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:20,227
Nobody has done like this. No one has done like this.

778
00:42:20,428 --> 00:42:24,031
We had so many people removed 
from Sahaja Yoga, you know that very well.

779
00:42:24,232 --> 00:42:28,083
But the way he has gone down and the way he was with us for the

780
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:30,507
last fourteen years, it’s surprising.

781
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:32,580
And I understand that people ask me

782
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,663
questions, I understand why it is happening.

783
00:42:34,812 --> 00:42:36,380
But be careful now!

784
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,993
Let us not be

785
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:43,993
lost with these foolish stupid ideas we had.

786
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:47,356
And let us be something great.

787
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:51,067
Let us be within ourselves, see for ourselves.

788
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,571
No amount of arrogance,

789
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,100
no amount of artificiality

790
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,020
is going to give us any special personality,

791
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,140
except that we realise what we are.

792
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,380
And when we know what we are,

793
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,363
we enjoy ourselves, we never get bored,

794
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,580
we enjoy ourselves

795
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,570
— never get bored.

796
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,219
So at the beginning of the programme I have to say that

797
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,620
I have seen the Sahaja Yogis if they want to be good they can be

798
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,936
really very good people,

799
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:27,340
in England, because the quality

800
00:43:28,322 --> 00:43:31,820
of intelligence is much better,

801
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:35,620
perhaps, also their scholarship is very good.

802
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,102
But when they fall,

803
00:43:39,302 --> 00:43:41,947
they fall also very fast

804
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,300
and go down very much.

805
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:48,294
So on what we have to depend

806
00:43:48,494 --> 00:43:51,385
is to our step

807
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:55,493
where we are standing and what step we are going to take further.

808
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:57,691
For example meditating:

809
00:43:57,891 --> 00:44:01,608
Dr. Brian Wells told me that people don’t want to meditate

810
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,388
in the ashram.

811
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:07,668
Now meditation is very important, is the only way we can grow.

812
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,585
Now all right, people used to get up,

813
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,341
say about ten o’clock before.

814
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,054
But do you don’t get drunk,

815
00:44:15,254 --> 00:44:17,415
why should you get up at ten o’clock?

816
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,928
You have to get up in the morning. You have to look after yourself:

817
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,868
means you have to look after your Spirit!

818
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:28,500
And that’s what we have to achieve.

819
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:32,140
And I know if you all decide you can do it very well.

820
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:34,620
Among yourselves

821
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:39,140
is better understanding

822
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,420
but when it comes to others

823
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,940
it seems there’s some sort of a

824
00:44:46,023 --> 00:44:47,842
communication gap

825
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:51,002
which should not be.

826
00:44:51,392 --> 00:44:54,900
If the Germans could be that gentle and so sweet.

827
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:56,835
You’ve seen the German people

828
00:44:57,036 --> 00:44:58,653
who are Sahaj Yogis

829
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:00,777
— even to touch a flower

830
00:45:00,977 --> 00:45:04,977
is easier than to touch a German I 
tell you they have become so gentle,

831
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,140
because they have learnt a lesson.

832
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,420
And I asked a German, “What’s the matter with English?

833
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,420
Why haven’t they learnt a lesson?”

834
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,362
He answered me back,

835
00:45:14,562 --> 00:45:16,820
which is a very important thing to know,

836
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,340
“They have never lost a war Mother.

837
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:23,202
They have to lose one war, they’ll be all right.”

838
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:35,460
So the gentleness,

839
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,765
which is not outward,

840
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:40,540
which is not just a lip service,

841
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,060
but from within:

842
00:45:43,261 --> 00:45:45,472
“How can they hurt someone?”

843
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:50,902
I mean, I had to put myself into

844
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:53,691
a frame of mind to talk to you like this.

845
00:45:54,009 --> 00:45:57,379
And I didn’t know how many flowers I should

846
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,580
weave round my words so that it should not hurt you.

847
00:46:06,678 --> 00:46:08,580
And even then, you see,

848
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,285
the back of my mind, there’s a kind of a sadness,

849
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,504
because I love you so much

850
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:17,705
and it shows that I have stayed with you the most of the time.

851
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,446
You are specially privileged.

852
00:46:20,646 --> 00:46:22,350
But that should give you

853
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,282
greater humility.

854
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,261
Because whatever are my qualities

855
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:28,314
they should be much more in you

856
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:31,485
and be shown to people that they
should, “Oh, English, we can make out,

857
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:33,940
they’re like Mother to look at.

858
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,220
They are like Mother to behave. They are just like Mother.”

859
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,340
Let me hear that.

860
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:44,075
All right? So it’s a promise to me

861
00:46:44,276 --> 00:46:47,060
— is it all right? — on an Ashtami day.

862
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,911
Let us finish all these negativities

863
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:53,020
and let us become that special type of people

864
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,279
- who are worshipped all over. - All right?

865
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,080
May God Bless You.
