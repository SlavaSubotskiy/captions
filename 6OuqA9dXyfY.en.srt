1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:05,128
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

2
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:10,081
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

3
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:14,813
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

4
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,782
Now again, second one.

5
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:23,236
Now the third one.

6
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,121
Now the fourth one.

7
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:36,186
Now the fifth.

8
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:41,776
Now the sixth one.

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,214
And now the seventh.

10
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:48,703
Now raise your Kundalini.

11
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:51,894
Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

12
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:54,759
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

13
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,645
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

14
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:00,340
one knot.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,451
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

16
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,906
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

17
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,322
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

18
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,593
Take it to your head, push back your head

19
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:17,884
and give it two knots there, one and two.

20
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:19,317
Now let's do the other one.

21
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:23,133
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

22
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:29,487
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

23
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:36,772
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

24
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:44,446
Now see your vibrations.

25
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:52,002
See your vibrations like this

26
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:57,439
All the children, see your vibrations like this. Put your hands.

27
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:30,456
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

28
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:39,640
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
