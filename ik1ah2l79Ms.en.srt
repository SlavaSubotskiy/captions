1
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:06,220
Today's Puja we have arranged of Durga or
the Kali.

2
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:14,060
That is the destroying form of the Goddess
of all the evil and negativity.

3
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:28,060
This we had to do it in France, because I
feel very strongly that day by day, in general,

4
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,950
France is going down and down and down.

5
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,140
While you people are coming up, the rest of
the France is in the most pitiable condition.

6
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:50,470
Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic
church, which - perhaps you are not aware

7
00:01:50,470 --> 00:02:00,330
of, perhaps maybe - because you don't read
any other languages, you just read French

8
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,960
compulsorily by this country.

9
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:17,050
So you have no international views or international
news that this Catholic church has done so

10
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:24,840
many horrible things in the past, that is
unbelievable that they have anything to do

11
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,940
with God.

12
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:38,900
They burnt many cardinals in the heart - roasted
them.

13
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:47,209
Not only that, they killed so many people
who ever tried to utter a word about them.

14
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,730
They were much worse than Muslim people.

15
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:04,559
They went to other countries like South America,
America - all these places they're all Catholics

16
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,920
- even our country.

17
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,220
And they killed millions and millions of people.

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:23,890
Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started,
one of the things as I said yesterday is that:

19
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:33,599
you will have to pay for whatever you have
done, on mass scale or individual scale.

20
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:43,830
If that is the case, then one must know that
France has to pay a lot and this Catholic

21
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,030
church has to pay more.

22
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:59,069
Catholic church has just taken out yarns out
of their heads and started a theory of original

23
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,069
sin.

24
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:07,270
That's how to condemn every other Incarnation,
every other Prophet - that they were all with

25
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,520
original sin.

26
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:19,120
And even they said Mary was born with original
sin, for many popes they were discussing it.

27
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,360
This shows that this whole hocus-pocus religion
of Catholic church had to establish itself

28
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:38,630
by forcing people, by torturing them, by taking
all their ideas into their own control, give

29
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,940
them funny ideas like original sin.

30
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,840
Another is that you must confess, giving them
the left Vishuddhis.

31
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:01,590
They treated women as nothing and to Mother
of Mary they called Her a woman.

32
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,430
And this Paul, as I told you yesterday, is
a fact.

33
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:14,490
Now it's necessary for Sahaja Yogis to understand
how this Catholic church is so dangerous and

34
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,910
has been doing such harm.

35
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,229
As there has been so many books about it - that
you people don't read, because it's not in

36
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:27,229
French.

37
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:33,410
There are English books from America - you
must learn English.

38
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:41,190
It's very important now I feel, that all the
French must know English, they must read English.

39
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:51,389
French will not give you the international
personality that you are supposed to acquire.

40
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,800
You had some scholarship, not much.

41
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,949
The real scholarship comes from England and
also from America in English language, and

42
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,830
also from India.

43
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:14,760
One gentleman who tried to translate all these
things in UNESCO, he was thrown out by your

44
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,020
media.

45
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,720
Your media is taking full advantage that you
don't read any other newspapers; they are

46
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,960
doing whatever they feel like.

47
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:34,970
All kinds of scandals, all kinds of sensationalization
- whatever they want to write, they write

48
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,290
in free press.

49
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:44,710
On one side there's suppression of natural
life of human beings, let them to go to Freud.

50
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:52,039
Freud is the dirtiest man you can think of,
who has put his ideas into your head.

51
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,960
But as if you are already brainwashed people
that you accepted all that.

52
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,660
How could you accept Freud?

53
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,039
If Freud had come to India, they would have
killed him in no time!

54
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,960
What happens is that, somehow or other - I
don't know what is the reason, I don't know

55
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,789
where to place it, but the wisdom is not there.

56
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,200
There is no maturity, there is no wisdom.

57
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,060
America I can understand because it is only
two-three hundred years old.

58
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,000
But what about the French?

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,290
They have not been able to mature but they
have become extremely frivolous.

60
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,750
Maturity is finished.

61
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:43,349
One of the reasons could be that they want
that you should be always young.

62
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:52,080
In India, young people are called as stupid:
you call it gadha pachisi, means in 25 years

63
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,620
they are donkeys.

64
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:01,970
They are never regarded as sensible people
to be followed.

65
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:12,430
And gradually by this movement from Catholic
church to Freud, what has happened that you

66
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,479
haven't got your own personality to understand
what is right and what is wrong.

67
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,270
Of course I must say Sahaja Yogis must have
done lots of punyas and must be very courageous

68
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,100
people to be born in this country.

69
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,500
Otherwise I don't know how you could have
taken your birth here.

70
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:38,419
The law is so funny that they said it depends
on the mood of the magistrate.

71
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:47,510
(Shri Mataji laughing) You see the magistrate
doesn't know the law.

72
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,660
Such a stupid country in modern times I've
never known.

73
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,530
Nowhere in the world there's such a stupid
law as it is here.

74
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,290
Of course in America, there is no justice,
they do what they like.

75
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,200
But here is so-called modern people.

76
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,740
What is their condition is that they have
no sense of law.

77
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,580
If you ask them, "What is the law?"

78
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
They don't care.

79
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,690
It's the mood of the magistrate.

80
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:25,080
Now supposing he has had a big drink in the
last night, second day he comes with a hangover,

81
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,210
so finished.

82
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:33,850
And then he will be very much biased towards
the drunkards only.

83
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:45,250
So here it is becoming such a horrible society
that Indians would be shocked, beyond doubt,

84
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,410
but nothing but prostitution.

85
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:59,400
To see and to be seen.

86
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,930
Why?

87
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:08,390
Every woman has to dress up in such a way
that she should be attractive, for what?

88
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,100
Is she a prostitute?

89
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,850
All kinds of bathroom cultures developed.

90
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:27,360
For example French bath, you know what it
means, all over the world.

91
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,700
It's a very dirty habit of laziness, it comes
because of drinking.

92
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,850
If you drink too much, next morning you are
so lethargic that you take just a French bath

93
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,120
and go.

94
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,110
So, please try to remember as French Sahaja
Yogis, that your task is much more difficult

95
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:55,870
than the task of other countries, because
it lacks complete wisdom.

96
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:11,930
Neither you'll find in your institutions,
nor in your government, nor in any education.

97
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,210
It's lacking wisdom completely.

98
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:26,940
And to have wisdom, according to these Freudian
people, is that you are egoistical!

99
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:40,650
They have such funny ideas from the yarn of
Mr. Freud that no sensible man would accept.

100
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:47,809
But people have lost their senses, and like
blotting paper, whatever is filthy, destructive,

101
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:50,679
horrible, subhuman they try to absorb.

102
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:57,520
Supposed to be Christian nation.

103
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:13,660
Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand:
You must get hold of books and find out, where

104
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,660
are we?

105
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,490
I worked very hard in France, you know that
very well.

106
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,730
I used to think, this is the gate of hell.

107
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:34,920
But it is much worse than that, it's a mire
of filth and you are born here and you have

108
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,460
become like lotuses, so fragrant and beautiful.

109
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,110
You'll have to fight it out: I am always with
you, all My powers with you.

110
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:56,740
But remember that you have to fight the society,
you have to save so many people, you have

111
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
to rescue them.

112
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Children are given liberty, "Do what you like."

113
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,510
They have no sense of liberty!

114
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:08,309
Supposing there's an aeroplane, which was
not fixed properly and made to fly.

115
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,610
What will happen to the aeroplane?

116
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:19,270
If the children are given liberty without
the right sense of their duty and the right

117
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:27,150
sense about themselves, what will happen to
them?

118
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,130
Why children are born to parents?

119
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:39,370
It is - to get spoiled, to have liberty or
to get some guidance?

120
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,300
You cannot guide your children.

121
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,300
They are so rude, they are so arrogant.

122
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,130
They have gone off, completely.

123
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,960
You know for one month we had to struggle
with these western children and we had come

124
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:04,040
to the point of urge of closing down that
school because they were really violent children,

125
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,380
as if coming from some jungle.

126
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,210
Even the jungle animals have some sense.

127
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,450
So you've to think about your children.

128
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,690
What's going to happen to your children?

129
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,720
What is going to be their situation?

130
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:32,089
If they are going to live in the same manner
in this dirt, these children will turn out

131
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,060
to be waste, just a waste!

132
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:49,320
They will have no education, no character,
no personality, they'll end up with AIDS or

133
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,510
with drugs or something like that.

134
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:03,750
I do not see any future for the children of
France, no future.

135
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,250
And you have to fight that, "We want to have
future for our children, we don't want them

136
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,429
to be ruined."

137
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,949
And you must have courage, to fight it.

138
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,900
It's very important to have courage.

139
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,860
If you do not have the courage, you cannot
fight it.

140
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,850
And today's Puja is to give that courage in
your hearts.

141
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,850
See it all around you, what's happening?

142
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,880
You are all nicely enjoying yourself in the
realm of God, (Shri Mataji smiling) you have

143
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,150
entered into the Kingdom of God.

144
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:45,169
But what about the rest of the people?

145
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:51,720
The majority of the people, where are they
going?

146
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:07,160
What is going to be the future of this horrible
Mooladhara place?

147
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:19,791
Now Freud has been discovered as a fraudulent
man, and now there are books after so many

148
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:25,500
years, when he has already ruined the people
all over the world.

149
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,959
But the worst of all they have ruined here.

150
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:38,220
It's a responsibility specially of the women
I think, because they are responsible for

151
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,940
the society.

152
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:50,209
The society of France has gone to dogs and
for you to now take up upon yourself to talk

153
00:16:50,209 --> 00:17:04,520
against this kind of anarchy that is working
out the destruction of your families.

154
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:15,750
If the women decide, I am sure, they can very,
very easily work it out.

155
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:26,130
Instead of asking for liberation nonsensical,
you better ask for the ascent of this country.

156
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,472
I know I've worked very hard and you are all
there.

157
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:44,730
I am very happy to see that you all are there
to fulfill the desires of the Divine.

158
00:17:44,730 --> 00:18:00,150
Because now you should know in a very big
way, masses of masses of people will be destroyed.

159
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,040
Not from without but from within.

160
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,470
Suddenly you'll hear so many millions disappear
with this disease.

161
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:25,830
Also you must protect yourself, all of you:
always give yourself a bandhan; always lead

162
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,010
a clean life.

163
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,550
There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja
Yoga, please try to follow them.

164
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,390
Do not neglect it.

165
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:45,330
If somebody gets AIDS, you'll not have him
in Sahaja Yoga, whatever may be the conditions,

166
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,440
whatever may be the reason.

167
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,830
You have to be very careful, also I would
say never treat a AIDS patient.

168
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:01,270
Like the one yesterday who was arguing with
Me, actually because they have only two types

169
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:13,840
of people: one who are arrogant and another
one which always think that it's better they

170
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
should die.

171
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
They have no will to live.

172
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,830
So there are only two types of people, either
right-sided or left-sided.

173
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,350
And they can never ascend.

174
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,950
We have tried, we have tried, of course one
first one is living for the last seven years,

175
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,020
but still.

176
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:35,130
He has no faith in himself.

177
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,420
Maybe next generation might be better on,
if they come back.

178
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,500
But as far as this generation is concerned,
you should know your responsibility is very

179
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
great.

180
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:58,680
All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow that
they'll fight this society and try to save

181
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,530
their country and their countrymen from a
complete disaster.

182
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:12,780
There is going to be no war, only they will
fight themselves and die.

183
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,090
It's a very serious matter.

184
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:27,870
For that, we decided to have this Puja of
Durga today that all negativity should be

185
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,870
destroyed.

186
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,130
So many Deities build up the body of Kali.

187
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:46,710
Every part of Her body was created by a Deity,
looked after by a Deity, and is also, later

188
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,530
on, is reflected in you all.

189
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:57,260
So they say that God has made human beings
in His own image, I would say, I've made you

190
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,010
in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal.

191
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:10,350
They're all with you, and they have created
you - if you see it minutely - it is the Deities

192
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,990
who have brought forth all the beauty that
you had.

193
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:25,560
They have made all this beautiful congregation,
beautiful transformation, and they have created

194
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:32,810
such angelic people out of you.

195
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:41,320
They are always working it out, but one thing
you have to do is to have the drive.

196
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,660
You had pure desire to ascend, but for what?

197
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,300
You want to have the light, but for what?

198
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,150
You want to become gurus, for what?

199
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,340
To save people, for their salvation.

200
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,950
Only through your channels I can work out
Sahaja Yoga.

201
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,000
If I could work out Myself, I would have.

202
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,600
It's not question of killing one rakshasa.

203
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,020
God knows how many there are, rakshasas and
rakshasas.

204
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:24,150
And they are everywhere, even within you they
were.

205
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:30,260
Now they've gone out.

206
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,500
So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga,
that's very important.

207
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:46,690
I knew the puja would be very late, because
Kali's puja is always done in the night, after

208
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,690
twelve.

209
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,690
So it had to be this way.

210
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:55,971
Though last night I slept at four o'clock
and I, tonight, I don't know what am I to

211
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:57,740
do, - it all works out.

212
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,170
It's all worked out.

213
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:10,570
But you have to have deliberations and you
have to think, "What can we do to change this?"

214
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,800
Why not write some books, why not write some
experiences?

215
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Get them published in French only.

216
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,990
Let the French know what's happening outside.

217
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:22,820
Get some of the books translated - some American
books, some English books.

218
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,650
At least give quotations from there.

219
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,650
How they are unaware.

220
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,650
First this Catholic church has to go away.

221
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:36,450
It will, no doubt, I am sure about it.

222
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:43,260
They are literally frightened of us.

223
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:51,820
And we have to now really show them what we
are capable of.

224
00:23:51,820 --> 00:24:03,260
And the funniest thing is that a president
has chosen his lady-friend as the prime minister.

225
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,500
I mean, it's not possible in any sensible
country.

226
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,390
It's never heard of.

227
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,340
I must say, English are thousand times better.

228
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,030
They are really very good.

229
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:24,430
At least, as far as administration is concerned,
as far as their parliament is concerned, the

230
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:31,390
justice is not stupid like this, it's based
on law, not based on the mood of a magistrate.

231
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:39,600
How you are still continuing with such stupidity
which are really even before medieval age:

232
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:47,710
primitive, people are absolutely primitive
to accept such laws.

233
00:24:47,710 --> 00:25:01,080
At least you can write a book about the strange
laws of French, one title.

234
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
How it has harmed.

235
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
There is a very nice book "Fraudulent Freud".

236
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,160
Please read that, and see how Freud has ruined
the French, how their brains are twisted,

237
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,130
how they have twisted ideas.

238
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,850
You are also intelligent, clever people.

239
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:23,170
So if not with the sword, Kali has to work
through the pen.

240
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:38,660
I never knew it was in that bad shape, though
I knew it was.

241
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:47,010
So this is a challenge for all of us, and
let Me see what you can write, all of you

242
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:54,840
- put together your experience: how the French
parents behave, how the grandparents behave,

243
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:10,610
what's happening in this country and all that.

244
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,610
They are living in fool's paradise.

245
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:17,900
They don't know how destruction is just hanging
over their heads.

246
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:31,250
Though you are all saved, but you have to
think of others, that is what Sahaja Yoga

247
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:38,880
is, that is not only that we care for the
bhaktas - like Kali just wanted to protect

248
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
the bhaktas, the sadhakas.

249
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:54,170
But you have 
to protect many, many more people.

250
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,890
You have all the powers, just assume them
and use them.

251
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,230
You can do it.

252
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:11,803
Your media is the worst of all and we can
start the newspaper also calling it anti-media.

253
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:12,803
What can they do to us?

254
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:13,803
Or some sort of an independent name, we can
give it.

255
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:31,290
And it should be open for people who are suffering
from media sensationalization.

256
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:37,610
They can write: how the media is harming them,
how they are giving false reports and things.

257
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,630
We can!

258
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,640
Why not?

259
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:51,610
I am sure it will work out.

260
00:27:51,610 --> 00:28:01,640
Think it over what you can do with your pen.

261
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,650
Whatever you have gained, whatever you are
enjoying: beautiful music, all the Pujas,

262
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,650
everything.

263
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,650
But think of others.

264
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,490
They are already drunk and tossing their heads
on their pillows.

265
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,490
Think of them.

266
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,210
They, when will they feel this joy?

267
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:25,150
I simply feel pity for them that they should
have taken to all these bad things, because

268
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,910
of the suppression of the Catholic church.

269
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:34,991
It's the Catholic church which has suppressed
them, that's why they have come to this.

270
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:39,920
No other way - reason why they should accept
this kind of thing.

271
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,920
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these things,
we're in the centre.

272
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,740
We do not have this kind of problems, because
we don't suppress anyone, nor do we go to

273
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,800
the other extreme of indulgences.

274
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:01,550
I think the whole Europe can be divided into
two types of people: one are Anglo-Saxons,

275
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,340
and others are Latins.

276
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:11,610
Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins
are left-sided: they cry, weep, miserable,

277
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,380
they indulge into dirt and filth.

278
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,030
Just these two types they are.

279
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:27,050
Now unluckily you are in the Latin side.

280
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:32,809
So here, Catholic church is prospering.

281
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:41,850
Now, if you see to the Latin side and understand
to what extent they have gone to the left

282
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:50,390
side, and getting to the left side what diseases
you get, very nicely, make a list of them.

283
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:58,640
So what I said will work out in France: the
left-sided incurable diseases.

284
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,790
As it is, you walk on the street, you find
at least three, four mad people, lunatic people

285
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,790
walking, you'll find.

286
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,790
Very simple it is.

287
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:13,630
Don't have to go to the lunatic asylum, on
the street!

288
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,800
They'll be all talking and saying things,
but it's all there.

289
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,850
That's why they drink, that's why they are
miserable.

290
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:34,890
I do not know what are the statistics of the
diseases.

291
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,340
So the problem is extremely grave, very grave.

292
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:43,740
And you have to work it out, with the gravity
of your gurupada which you have asked Me the

293
00:30:43,740 --> 00:31:00,410
other day - you asked for the status of a
guru, for ladies as well as for men.

294
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,410
And I said, "All right, start!"

295
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,830
I hope you all have heard the song I've made,
for asking.

[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

297
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,710

[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]

299
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,290
They will sing that song to you.

300
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:25,500
There are different request from the Mother,
and in this the last one is that: "Mother,

301
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:31,370
now you give us the gurupada, the status of
a guru."

302
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:38,190
But every guru has a duty: to cleanse the
society in which he lives.

303
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,850
It's his duty, he has to fight it.

304
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,470
Christ fought it alone, so many saints fought
it alone, they were treated very badly, put

305
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,790
in jail, given poisons, things, but they fought
it.

306
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,740
In the same way you stand on Truth, and you
have to fight it.

307
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,810
Because you are saints.

308
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,870
May God bless you!

00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,970
I don't think all of you have heard it, because
those who came to Guru Puja must have.
