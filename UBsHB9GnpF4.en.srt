1
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:21,032
happy Easter to y'all so we celebrate Easter to
show how Christ resurrected resurrected himself

2
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:41,942
the spirit that is Christ has to resurrect out of
the material manifestation of the divine itself

3
00:00:41,942 --> 00:01:07,952
the matter is manifested because we ourselves
have created it not that we are born out of

4
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:20,072
matter our body but we are attached to it we
want to want to have it whatever you want that

5
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:32,872
sustains itself by your desire because
now you are on the stage if you want to

6
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:42,952
sustain the matter if you want to keep the
matter as the first priority it will remain

7
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:56,992
it cannot disappear it has to go out of your
mind that matter cannot hold you any further

8
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:06,982
Christ rose out of the matter came out of the
tomb which symbolizes the matter which has in

9
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:17,392
enclosed us within which has to be open
out with our spiritual power throw away

10
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:27,382
throw with a stone that is covering this
grave get out of that and stand outside

11
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:43,042
this is the message of Christ's resurrection
the tomb that we have created we have created

12
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:55,972
ourselves because we have allowed people
to dominate us we have allowed them to make

13
00:02:55,972 --> 00:03:10,642
these graves for us we have allowed them to bury
Christ within ourselves because we were afraid

14
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:29,082
but Christ has to rise so we create our
own matter through our conditionings

15
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:36,732
through our fears through our absolute
wrong ideas about goodness and kindness

16
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:44,982
and compassion in the light of the
Spirit you can see what we think as

17
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:53,562
compassion is nothing but a kind of
a sympathy which leads you nowhere

18
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:05,802
but one should learn to see everything in the
light of the Spirit but do we use all the time

19
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:17,472
the light of the Spirit we do not for Christ it
was not difficult, because he was the Spirit but he

20
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:30,162
has shown you the way he crucified himself to show
you the way all the ideas about sophistication

21
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:46,812
about our standing in the society how we relate
ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country

22
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:57,192
to our politics to our economics and the world I
draw large all of them can tied us down to that

23
00:04:57,192 --> 00:05:08,052
tomb you belong to another category I have told
you hundred times I'm in a category which is a

24
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:20,022
spirit which can rise about all the tools and
throw everything this way you are conditioned

25
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:28,092
all absurd ideas have been accepted which you
cannot explain why you were conditioned like this

26
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:40,592
why I talk more of conditioning because of
England English are very much conditioned

27
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:46,112
people the others are Americans were abundant
I mean you can't talk to them about anything

28
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:53,342
because they cannot be rooted in toilet but
English had too much conditioned people and

29
00:05:53,342 --> 00:06:04,172
when they are too much conditioned they build
their own tools all these ideas are to be seen

30
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:20,072
with a new dimension of awareness that you have
you are the spirit why should you worry about

31
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:29,702
anything else but your vibrations because you're
saying I should just worry about the comfort of

32
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:40,802
your spirit whatever congenial to your spirit just
worn doing that observing that accumulating that

33
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:46,682
and settling within yourself all conditionings
will run away because these conditionings you

34
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:50,462
accept because they look comfortable
they look comfortable but they are not

35
00:06:55,162 --> 00:07:03,682
Christ is a great example and he fee is the
one whom you follow if he is the one who may

36
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:10,492
have understood and recognized in the light of
your spirit then you must know why why did he

37
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:18,292
go into the grave first of all the man was so
powerful who when he'll come he'll reduce all

38
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:26,752
of them into ashes such a great personality
like him of a kadesha rudra why did Christ

39
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:36,352
allowed himself to be crucified and to
be married into that because he wanted

40
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:44,812
to stoop down to the level of other people to
come down to that level so that people should

41
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:52,732
see that through his life is shown that you
can be resurrected now the resurrection has

42
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:59,182
taken place Sergio keys are resurrected no
doubt but still in one foot is in the green

43
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:14,632
and the second one I don't know whether it will
be outdoor if it is just half way through one

44
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:21,652
foot is of course outside no doubt but still is
not yet touching the ground and the other one

45
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:26,182
cannot be lifted and listen to push the
ground this matter again to push it out

46
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:39,352
if you live with your spirit you should have
no fears should have no worry see now I'll

47
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:48,442
tell you how God is showing his ways here like
in Dharam the fellow is now under complete fire

48
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:56,632
he's our know what to do and himself is so
stupid and senseless saying is that Vanaja

49
00:08:56,632 --> 00:09:02,602
Kali predictably when your destruction
time comes you think of all perverted

50
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:08,152
things before it Aboudi so he's done if
you I mean see to the way he speaks I

51
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:15,742
mean blasphemous and he is under fire he
himself lit the fire and now sitting on

52
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:23,932
top of it and now when he gets the heat the
heated words come out of his mouth we don't

53
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:28,522
have to do anything it's all done already
they are baked and cooked in their own

54
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:44,492
so why should we have fear but we should
know what is right and what is wrong

55
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:54,782
that's only possible because you are with the
absolute that is the spirit and related to the

56
00:09:54,782 --> 00:10:00,092
absolute if you do everything related to they
are doing the right thing if you are related

57
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:05,942
to Christ how can he do wrong that's one of the
proofs that they are not Christians of anything

58
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:13,562
because none of the Christian organizations
have done anything good whatsoever except

59
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:26,642
for creating fire for themselves so you can see
clearly how this conditioning has worked within

60
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:32,582
us because we have been so-called Christians
we have been going to churches we have been

61
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:38,042
worshipping Christ as they told us the way they
told us we worshipped him everything regimented

62
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:53,282
the one who came to resurrect us from the
bondage of the grave we used him to build

63
00:10:53,282 --> 00:11:10,922
our graves now you are out of it thank God
but take out the other foot fast this is one

64
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:16,802
advantage you have because you have Christ
before you but also there's a disadvantage

65
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:27,212
because Christ has been used to shut you down
in the grave so change your concept about Christ

66
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:35,552
know him through your vibrations what he was
I mean as a child I knew what was going wrong

67
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:40,892
with Christians and left and right little girl
like me about seven years to give big lectures

68
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:48,932
even when I was baptized I was horrified
the way I was baptized by some stupid fellow

69
00:11:52,002 --> 00:12:00,702
I didn't know what was he up to and then he
put a booth on my head I think or something

70
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:08,052
which hovered round and we met with and very
big accident I fell down this booth must have

71
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:17,622
put it in the horse ID but rather booth this
priest the super stupid fellow he belonged to

72
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:21,852
the Lutheran Church I don't know what you call
through of that Lutheran imagine Martin Luther's

73
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:30,162
Church and that's how they baptized me I D I
knew all about it but I didn't know what to do

74
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:44,772
I must have kicked him quite a lot but whatever
it is so far he baptized me I had to accept all

75
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:52,332
foolish stupid things in this life because I had
to show I was quite normal me not being accepting

76
00:12:52,332 --> 00:13:02,172
stupid is normal these days and to tolerate an
idiot is even more normal so I had to show that

77
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:14,262
I knew very well what sort of a thing it was this
fellow was up to and I accepted the nonsense he

78
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:27,042
did and many other things I accepted just to show
that I am nothing special but I knew all about it

79
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:34,662
and when I saw the way Christ
was described I was aghast I

80
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:41,052
said what are they doing to Christ for
me nicely second crucifixion going on

81
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:56,112
we also know about it thank God there are so
many to whom I can talk and they understand

82
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:04,752
my language but the resurrection will not
be complete unless and until you pull out

83
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:12,462
many out of their grace I don't know how
you'll go about it look at this fellow

84
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:19,332
Dharam who get such a publicity when he's
doing all blasphemous thing he's getting

85
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:28,002
all the credit and kudos from people what
about us what are we doing why not we write

86
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:34,602
to the newspapers why not we talk to them
Observer has given us a clue I think there's

87
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:41,022
one gentleman mr. Wilson he wrote it quite
nicely why not try to him some letters get we

88
00:14:50,442 --> 00:15:00,282
because you see what I am little
concerned about this matter is as

89
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:06,162
it is they're half-hearted Christians now
if this Durham fellow speaks like that who

90
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:12,072
is now the big a 30 on Christianity Christ
his mother and everybody else mr. Dharam

91
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:18,312
and now this fellow if he goes on like this
those who are half-baked will already fall

92
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:27,072
off to communism and the rest of them
who may remain also they may accept him

93
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:40,872
so the Anglicans anglo-saxon brain
i am saying is going to accept mr.

94
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:45,432
Dharam very well I can see that
or else they will just leave and

95
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:50,712
become communists I have nothing to do
with this God who has so many problems

96
00:15:55,602 --> 00:16:02,592
so in the seminar of yours in Birmingham when
you have I would like you to think over this

97
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:10,692
new thing that has come up in the heart of the
universe everyone knows about Durham fellow they

98
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:17,952
know his plight everything but what about us
we are so many let us try to find out how we

99
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:26,652
can talk to these people sensibly talk to these
Anglicans find out about them and communicate

100
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:33,552
to them what you have found out you need not say
in the beginning only that I am the ADI Shakti or

101
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:43,722
I am the Redeemer and the comforter that Christ
has said but we can start talking about find out

102
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:49,812
these people these Anglicans church people church
goers would believe in God who believe in Christ

103
00:16:55,352 --> 00:17:02,042
I mean they are voting can you imagine they are
voting here whether Christ was true or not can

104
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:14,672
you vote like that you feel you are in a lunatic
asylum or what it's terrible they're taking words

105
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:26,312
can you imagine such a thing like that at this
moment we have an advantage because they are

106
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:31,232
so much confused to give them concrete idea as
to what is God what is Christ what is religion

107
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:40,052
one side I feel very hurt unhappy I think
these three days I have gone through real

108
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:51,332
resurrection myself the way things have been about
Christ just I can't bear it and it is too much

109
00:17:54,632 --> 00:18:02,702
you all should be stirred also should be
concerned and you must go through it and

110
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:11,792
see what you can do and tell them are you all
mad or what why don't you listen to sanity as

111
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:19,502
you know when I went to Australia it's a
different country altogether they're much

112
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:27,692
more sensible people than you are I think the
way they were exiled they learnt a lesson and

113
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:37,262
they are better so I feel the English have to go
into exile or jail for a while to understand it

114
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:46,772
there are very sensible extremely sensible
people you can talk to them sense everyone

115
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:54,842
the media is sensible the people are sensible
thousands of them came they repeated no first

116
00:18:54,842 --> 00:19:02,852
program we had once it was 1,600 2000 can you
imagine such people and out of them repeats for

117
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:10,742
600 now for the last how many years we are
having the same 600 people again and again

118
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:15,902
what seminars are we going to do all of us
eating and cooking some chicken that's what

119
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:29,542
or making some cake for mother which
she doesn't eat let us take out our

120
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:38,092
satisfactions from these little lazy theme
into something bigger let us talk about it

121
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:48,982
without fear we have to go and talk and
tell people about it take it a big way

122
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:56,662
there should be no hindrance on this point we are

123
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,082
a very big group we can assert
and we can talk and meet people

124
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:23,102
the situation has improved a lot because now
I have to go to India as you know and in India

125
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:32,522
for me the situation is much better it's not
at all difficult as you know I went to the

126
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:41,192
hills at the foothills of Himalayas but three
thousand people came from all over the little

127
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:48,662
dirty villages that they had they didn't take
even a second to recognize me they were singing

128
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:58,202
the praise of the goddess of the hills goddess
of the Tigers goddess of the Lions this started

129
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:05,792
singing my place without any lecture or anything
we were all joyous that I've been there and they

130
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:10,142
knew Anna they accepted me and finished I have
to just put my foot down there and I've done

131
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:22,982
Jaipur they said mother you just put your foot
here oh really so for me the situation is very

132
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:29,612
good in India now let's see what you people
are going to do with these big big seminars and

133
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:41,762
lectures why not get some outsiders to listen
to you invite them invite these intellectuals

134
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:54,922
try to talk to them tell them what is it
what do you call them those who know about

135
00:21:54,922 --> 00:22:09,412
Bible what how theologians see or what
najin's without logics theologians call

136
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:24,532
these theologians challenge them why not put
a challenge we are not alone you are so many

137
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:31,302
and don't tell them you wear saris when you come

138
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:42,462
for my puja they won't understand it they
are not that deep you can wear your jeans

139
00:22:46,112 --> 00:22:56,342
or to convince them more you can be punks that
would have bring them better you go with your

140
00:22:56,342 --> 00:23:09,152
funky conditions their jolly well have to listen
to the otherwise they are in for trouble if they

141
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:15,302
had that stupid why not handle them it's very
easy to handle a stupid person than to handle

142
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:22,532
a person who is not who is not stupid nor who
is clever stupid can be stupefied very easy

143
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:34,682
so I think we have to change our course
we have to take it in a big way the whole

144
00:23:34,682 --> 00:23:39,752
thing what we are going to do all of you
should give some concrete ideas as to what

145
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:48,332
you would like to do and that would be
really the way it will work out so now

146
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:58,202
in the seminar you must discuss more how to
talk to these people how to create a platform

147
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:05,672
for sahaja yoga find out how do they create
a platform out of nothing like this bunks

148
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:22,612
and once you do all these things you will be
surprised that they will have to listen they'll

149
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:30,892
have to listen now go full ahead I'm giving you
all freedom do what you want except for telling

150
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:37,012
them that I am Adi Shakti that they won't be able
to digest that an Indian has become now the ADI

151
00:24:37,012 --> 00:24:59,482
Shakti they think now additionally has to be an
English lady at least French so don't patient

152
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:05,452
me if you want you can but don't mention me as
guru or anything but you should succeed that lady

153
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:13,012
who showed us the way and or something like that
not referring much to me but to them I think you

154
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:18,472
should go ahead with it and work it out because
now we have had lot of patience and all nonsense

155
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:26,992
going round us better tell them or are you going
to allow all of them to go to hell direct message

156
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:35,992
of Easter East comes from East I don't know why
they call it Easter and we were thought of it

157
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:41,032
why do they call it a Worcester sauce I don't know

158
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:45,982
I don't know why they call
anything anything but Easter

159
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:58,782
you can't explain you know like
her screen you don't know so I

160
00:25:58,782 --> 00:26:01,332
don't know but Eastern it is coming from the east

161
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:09,852
the wisdom has to come from the east the
resurrection has to come from the east

162
00:26:09,852 --> 00:26:23,352
whether they like it or not and that is the
message of Easter today that let us give them

163
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:30,432
the chance of resurrection by talking to them
all of you should make it a pun go and talk to

164
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:36,282
people who are in charge of theology churches
Bibles go and talk to them tell them what are

165
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:42,642
you doing I remind why I want to die why do you
want to be sleep people do not know anything

166
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:53,892
another thing I would suggest that we should have
regular classes to understand sahaja yoga properly

167
00:26:53,892 --> 00:27:02,322
I have seen some people who are sahaja Yogi's
for years don't know anything about sahaja yoga

168
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:11,052
even in Bombay people told that some of the late
these are absolutely zero as far as sahaja Yoga

169
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:17,472
is concerned they don't understand what is sahaja
Yogi's they don't understand what is what are what

170
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:21,492
are the chakras are they listen to your lecture
everything and then like a bubble the whole thing

171
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:26,742
disappears from their minds I don't know who gave
them these ideas but they were quite shocked so

172
00:27:26,742 --> 00:27:32,292
let us have a class like thing for sahaja Yogi's
two different topics and subjects let us work it

173
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:41,142
out recently you must be knowing there's a book
going to be published by Yogi Bhajan called Neeta

174
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:46,362
enlightened which is a very good book of course
I mean most of it I have had three Mary's being

175
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:50,442
with me and all that but doesn't matter but
he's understood the subject the other day they

176
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:59,172
published a very beautiful book in Marathi once
soraka such a lovely book he wrote that in the

177
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:08,742
light of gana shuara what is sahaja yoga and it's
written it so well that anybody was a theologian

178
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:16,452
or anything like in India will be impressed by
I wish I could translate that book for you but

179
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:25,662
it's all the stands us from Ganesha para which
is in Marathi language wrote such a nice book

180
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:31,782
on sahaja yoga and that is what he gave me on
my birthday is that something so substantial I

181
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:40,752
felt and once it reaches into the hands of any
one of these people I mean it will in any case

182
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:50,772
and he published himself he brought some copies
gave it to me and all the copies were sold out

183
00:28:50,772 --> 00:29:01,212
in that program every copy was sold out for two
rupees each so this is what we have to do now is

184
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:07,602
to write write two different magazines meet people
tell them we want to come and talk to you first of

185
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:13,452
all you must know about sahaja yoga you should
be well equipped it's not that you can show my

186
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:21,912
photograph with a light here that's not sufficient
what is the light here also you have to show only

187
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:29,022
few people know what is sahaja yoga the rest of
you don't know anything let us see what questions

188
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:37,692
we have in our mind let us sit down and find
out what are the questions what questions are we

189
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:42,852
lacking in what we have to understand in sahaja
yoga what part we don't know let's find out all

190
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:49,632
those things all the details let us write it down
every one of you whether it's a woman man child

191
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:57,672
everyone can do it find out what are the questions
which are not yet answered in sahaja yoga how can

192
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:05,322
we answer particular questions all right all these
things can be found out if you put your attention

193
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:12,162
to it you can easily find out what you need
everyone has to do it you must be all equipped

194
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:17,742
if anybody asks you a question about sahaja
yoga and if you cannot answer I mean how can you

195
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:24,192
convince people you take one ordinary so-called
lay man for Christianity so-called Christianity

196
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:31,902
again the man is lemon and the Christianity is
also lame he will give a big lecture on Christ

197
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:43,662
every verse the Bible is telling chapter Matthew's
2 verse 2 this is what Christ I said that you'll

198
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:55,842
be calling me Christ Christ and I will not
recognize you telling about himself only so

199
00:30:55,842 --> 00:31:02,292
you have to be absolutely equipped for it now
you have to also know what will confront in a

200
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:06,042
particular country for example when I come
to England I know I have to confront these

201
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:12,552
theologians and the Christ and everything if I go
to India what I have to confront I know I have to

202
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:22,152
face it on different lines and different fronts
you don't have to do that just think about your

203
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:27,822
own country for French have to think about France
you people have to think about this country and

204
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:35,892
then go ahead with it you can chalk out a good
program and work it out properly I'm sure by

205
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:41,862
God's grace everything you work out because when
are we going to do it now I am going away as I

206
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:46,752
told you to India and I don't know when will
I be back you wanted to arrange my program

207
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:52,992
to England in England but I think I cannot do it
because I have to go around to all the places you

208
00:31:52,992 --> 00:32:00,582
know pan all that finished that you better do that
during when I was not here what Turing did you do

209
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:18,622
nothing you could have taught now at least these
three months when we are having a nice summer

210
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:26,122
time I'll be traveling all over Europe everywhere
you please see that you go around England visit

211
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:32,212
different places arrange programs talk to people
find out who are the big Johnny said the mayor

212
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:40,612
stays that go and talk to them tell them about
this that is how new programming should be done

213
00:32:40,612 --> 00:32:47,692
and a new dimension should be given to our sahaja
yoga propaganda you have done no propaganda in the

214
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:54,412
right sense in the sense that we were not so much
sure about it that will work out but now we weigh

215
00:32:54,412 --> 00:33:02,392
because people are writing there's an atmosphere
against rice so we have to fight and that's how we

216
00:33:02,392 --> 00:33:10,402
should become the people who are fighting for
Christ now there could be areas where you can

217
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:17,212
talk of integration of talking about how we do
not know much about Christ that we have to go to

218
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:23,092
other books to find out who he was why did he come
on this earth we have to go much deeper we have

219
00:33:23,092 --> 00:33:27,982
to prove that there is divine power and you have
seen how divine power works what wonders there are

220
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:32,692
you take my photographs show them these are the
photographs can you explain these things that in

221
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:45,202
the hand you see the Sun show us in mrs. Thatcher
science even a star won't drink all these things

222
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:52,612
are to be seen in the right perspective and at
the right time we must do whatever is right at

223
00:33:52,612 --> 00:34:02,032
that point that is the way sahaja Yoga is hit
the point when it is to be hit if you cannot

224
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:07,522
do that way you cannot achieve so this is the
right time for you these are now three months

225
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:12,652
ahead of you I would like you to see what you
can do because now the Sun will be coming out

226
00:34:15,312 --> 00:34:22,662
we'll have a nice summer go ahead but now just
do not fix all your holiday during these three

227
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:30,972
three months going to some beach somewhere so
Yogi's have no time they are busy people they

228
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:42,552
have no time to waste we are on about a warpath
we have no time to quarrel among ourselves fight

229
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:51,732
we have to fight very great enemies we have no
time to waste on our families and our children

230
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:59,022
and our relations and father mother sister
brother we are on a warpath very important

231
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:07,542
so let us now prepare ourselves as Christ stood
out of that grave let us get out of this grave

232
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:21,612
of lethargy of compromising of comfort of our
past ideas about life's pleasures this is the

233
00:35:21,612 --> 00:35:32,472
new era that has to show its manifestation in
this country it's very important and you all can

234
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:41,022
do it you have to be very brave you have to be
self similar wise kind and also forthright but

235
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:46,152
you have to say what you have to say because it
has to be said and this is the only thing to be

236
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:52,482
said nothing else is important whatever these
people talk about has no meaning they are not

237
00:35:52,482 --> 00:36:03,552
mantras some of them are anti-god some may not be
but they are useless wasteful garbage s I should

238
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:10,422
say why they are given so much importance and
not the real thing that is there you understand

239
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:23,012
that this is the reality that is come into you
people actually you are Felda reality actually

240
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:36,152
you know the reality you are in the reality
why not talk about it why should we not is

241
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:43,322
it not the most important thing that we have
to do if you realize it I'm sure it will work

242
00:36:43,322 --> 00:36:52,142
out with all my blessings with all my love
I really command you to do that now may God

243
00:36:59,752 --> 00:37:06,082
today on this day you all should Wow Wow
that we are on the warpath and we are

244
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:10,312
going to find out ways and methods of doing
this thing for these three months we are

245
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:19,102
going to work it out just bow just ask for
wisdoms and the spiritual power that's all

246
00:37:19,102 --> 00:37:30,382
and promise it to Christ that
as you did we are going to do

247
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:43,796
may God bless

248
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,862
so many steaks

249
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:23,522
this is too much coming up in
less than three there are two

250
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:27,842
each of them their one year wonder
should be less than his burns better

251
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:21,882
when are you having your seminar weeks

252
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:34,772
I mean I would like to plan out my visit to
Southside London after this Birmingham mistake

253
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:43,742
and please ask the sahaja Yogi's abroad I mean
in the European countries how they would like me

254
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:55,502
to do it so that say Birmingham will be over by
the end of April middle of April then we can do

255
00:39:55,502 --> 00:40:01,412
the other places as well because I am going to
Austria in any case I will be able to come for

256
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:13,742
different food as I said but we can have a few
there so just find out I know they're all here

257
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:32,202
it's such a joyous meeting meeting all of you down
here but if you see in India foreign I will tell

258
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:38,442
you how I mean really I mean you do feel that why
should you deprive them isn't it sometimes you do

259
00:40:38,442 --> 00:40:45,252

this wife is a bitter as a guest because he's

have an initiation course to start your garden
the deepening course and actually we have few

542
02:45:30,323 --> 02:45:36,143
people who are following it in this quite quite
serious about it and in sahaja Yogi's that as to

543
02:45:36,143 --> 02:45:39,323
make any photo so because they have to give
the cost now - they have to know about such

544
02:45:39,323 --> 02:45:45,383
oh god that's that's working out with what
do you think of starting the course here

545
02:45:46,501 --> 02:45:57,301
and but we have we have been frankly a beginning
we are asking them to pay for participation and

546
02:45:57,301 --> 02:46:03,152
spaying then that is only because we give them
some tapes and papers and all that so they can

547
02:46:03,152 --> 02:46:10,711
read about sahaja yoga but we use it for that to
further the books the use and the tapes we give

548
02:46:10,711 --> 02:46:19,171
them tapes of your tapes mother and as very cheap
action it's the gesture but I think like that they

549
02:46:19,171 --> 02:46:23,791
did start and finish the course so that means
the course is three months mother so for Amelia

550
02:47:11,572 --> 02:47:24,772
I believe to whatever this is for Austria
those who want to go are very welcome there

551
02:47:24,772 --> 02:47:44,751
Austria now we have a new arsenal what
about Italy now whatever you have decide

552
02:47:44,751 --> 02:47:52,551
only one thing you asked us to if you could
come in 15 days in Paris it could be done

553
02:47:52,551 --> 02:47:59,841
but if we have little more time a bit you
know it may distill your mother April may

554
02:47:59,841 --> 02:48:06,411
end of method for example I don't need of
after maybe sastra I'm just saying we can

555
02:48:06,411 --> 02:48:10,401
do it in 15 days but if you really
want to make your coming successful

556
02:48:24,312 --> 02:48:25,032
we do the better

557
02:48:28,172 --> 02:48:52,772
