1
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:37,750
Today we have such a great opportunity to 
celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,420
He was born in a manger.

3
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,110
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:00:46,110 --> 00:01:02,989
That He should be born in a manger in difficult 
situations, to show that whether you are born

5
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:13,352
poor or rich, whether you are born in difficulties 
or in problems, if you have Divinity within

6
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:19,060
you it shines by itself.

7
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:37,700
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated 
line, they have never been able to understand

8
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,759
the significance of Christ.

9
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:51,960
To them immaculate conception is absolutely 
not possible.

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,009
Most of the people think that it's some sort 
of a mythical story.

11
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:19,150
But in India we do believe that Gauri created 
Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations and

12
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,260
that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

13
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,340
We accept it.

14
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,490
But not in the West.

15
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,360
They will never accept such a thing because 
their mental side is over-developed and dominates

16
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,960
them.

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:52,599
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians 
to understand that above all He is God.

18
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,980
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

19
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:08,580
Moreover, the way Christianity has been, it 
has not provided any proper guidance.

20
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:16,290
On the contrary wherever they have failed 
they said: "It's a mystery."

21
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,640
But it's very simple to understand for Indians, 
that anything is possible for God.

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,439
After all He is God.

23
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,480
He is God Almighty.

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:40,611
Because of this mental attitude which is much 
lower than the knowledge of your spirit, the

25
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:51,239
ordinary, mundane type of the superficial 
knowledge can never allow the personality

26
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,860
to accept the greatness of God.

27
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,010
I had a grandma.

28
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:10,340
She was My father's aunt and she used to tell 
us a nice story about somebody who was going

29
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,340
to meet God.

30
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,319
Of course this - in India everybody understands 
all these things.

31
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,840
They will not say: "How he is going to meet 
God?" but they accept.

32
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,829
All right, he is going to meet God.

33
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,890
So when he was going on the way, on the road, 
he found one gentleman sitting there nicely

34
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:35,190
singing songs, bhajans of God, doing nothing 
on the roadside.

35
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,120
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet 
God?"

36
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,910
"Yes, I am going to meet Him.

37
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,470
So have you any message for Him?"

38
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,900
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right, 
but He should arrange for my food, because

39
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,360
I think the food is now finishing."

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,449
He said: "Really, that's what you want me 
to tell Him?"

41
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,500
"Yes, yes, please tell Him.

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,210
Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell 
Him."

43
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,646
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman 
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian

44
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,646
way I would say he was going to church every 
day with nice suits, and singing hymns every

45
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,380
day, listening to the pastor's sermons, or 
whatever you may say; and in the Indian way

46
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,690
we can say he was going to the temple every 
day, standing on his head, doing all kinds

47
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,690
of yoga asanas and everything.

48
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,690
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've 
tried everything.

49
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,560
When is He going to meet me?

50
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,940
I would like to see Him.

51
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,710
I would like to have His darshan."

52
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,919
He said: "All right."

53
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:40,880
So he went to God, and whatever work he had 
he finished with it, and then God asked him:

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,490
"Have you got anything to tell Me?"

55
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:50,800
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman 
while coming and he said that 'I'm doing all

56
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,810
kinds of things, I have tried everything, 
and when will God meet me?

57
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,139
I am standing on my head, and I am doing also 
all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of

58
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,100
things, and also I am going to church and 
mosque, I am praying, doing all sorts of prayers,

59
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
but when will God meet me?'"

60
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:13,449
So God said: "Tell him he has to do a little 
more.

61
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,530
See, it's not easy.

62
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:30,340
When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

63
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,840
So then even he said: "And there is another 
one who was on the road, You see.

64
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,740
As he was just enjoying himself singing songs, 
he suddenly saw me, and he told me: 'You see,

65
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,700
my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange 
it for me.'"

66
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,270
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?"

67
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,470
Immediately God said: "What are you doing, 
why don't you go and look after him?

68
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,470
His food is finishing."

69
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,940
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged 
it, all that."

70
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,250
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter."

71
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,440
You see, he couldn't understand, you know, 
that this fellow who is trying all these things

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,849
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

73
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,510
And while this fellow is just singing songs 
of God and all that, and why is it so much

74
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:16,540
impressed by this another fellow who is doing 
nothing to seek God?

75
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,270
So then God realized that he is in some sort 
of an illusion.

76
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,280
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell 
them one thing.

77
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:32,020
To both of them the same thing, that 'When 
I went to God what I saw there was that He

78
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:40,270
made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

79
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,819
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

80
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,910
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the 
reaction."

81
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,910
So he went down.

82
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,169
So this is, the first one met him, he said: 
"What God has said?"

83
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,310
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja 
Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

84
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,039
Before that you'll go around like this."

85
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,479
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

86
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,130
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime.

87
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,400
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,979
And he was quite disappointed.

89
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,720
So he went.

90
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,699
And he asked him that: "What did you see with, 
there when you went to see God?"

91
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:22,770
He said: "I saw that, you know, He passed 
a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

92
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,259
He said: "What?

93
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,259
How is it possible?

94
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,259
It's impossible!"

95
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,259
(Now mental.)

96
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,219
"How is it possible, that a camel gets passed 
through the eye, it's not possible, see the

97
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,150
volume of this one and such a little thing.

98
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,190
How can he pass?

99
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,030
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story 
because you have been to God, you are trying

100
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,180
to show off, that's all.

101
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,110
I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

102
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,480
It's.. you are just telling me lies, and don't 
try to befool me."

103
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,310
So he went to another person who was on the 
street eating nicely.

104
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,910
He said: "How are you?"

105
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,900
"I know He had arranged before you reached 
there, I know it was all right after all.

106
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,810
You see He looks after me all the time.

107
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,339
So what did you see when you went there?"

108
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:10,920
He said: "I saw that God Almighty passed a 
camel through an eye of a needle.

109
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,979
It's a very amazing thing."

110
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:13,979
He said: "What, amazing?

111
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:16,360
He is God, do you know He is God?

112
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,740
Do you know He is God?

113
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,300
God can do anything.

114
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,040
He can do anything!"

115
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,110
That's made him understand, that if you understand 
that God is all-powerful, all-powerful, it

116
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,480
doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to 
Maharashtra.

117
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:52,280
It doesn't mean that!

118
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,930
But it means He is all powerful.

119
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:02,530
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing, 
and such things which our brain, this mental

120
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,839
side cannot understand.

121
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,870
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

122
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:17,000
This is what God is.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,810
He's the One who has created human beings.

124
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,650
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

125
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,250
If a potter creates a pot that means he is 
beyond the pot.

126
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,549
Pot cannot create God.. the potter.

127
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:36,770
And the potter has created the pot, so that 
means that this pot which is created by him

128
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:42,690
has to be something which is made by him, 
so he has to be much more powerful than the

129
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,980
pot is.

130
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:57,800
But it is unbelievable, or say beyond the 
conception of human beings, that what a God

131
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,790
it must be Who has made this great computer.

132
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,220
We take everything for granted.

133
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,010
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

134
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,790
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot 
make.

135
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,910
Ha, if there is some stone, all right you 
can put this up.

136
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,150
If there is some clay you can make some sort 
of a house out of it.

137
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,030
That's all dead from the dead.

138
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:43,230
But can you make a candle which will burn 
badhas?

139
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:55,569
You have seen it with your own eyes that before 
My photograph the badhas burn.

140
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,490
Can you do that?

141
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:15,559
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the 
complete, intricate working, delicate machinery,

142
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:24,860
and also very dynamic explosive machinery, 
how it works to create human beings, to create

143
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,560
all this universe, to create all these beautiful 
flowers and trees and everything.

144
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,790
Look at the stars.

145
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,040
Look at how many they are.

146
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,610
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth 
to create human beings.

147
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,850
How He has made it?

148
00:12:48,850 --> 00:13:00,140
When He wants to send His own Son, He can 
send it the way He wants to send it.

149
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:15,709
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind 
which is in, absolutely in mud.

150
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:25,150
So to accept it is only possible when you 
have saints, real saints who tell you, that

151
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:32,579
this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

152
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:44,310
But to jump into it, into faith, when you 
come to Sahaja Yoga you start seeing miracles

153
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,650
taking place.

154
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,699
Then you can understand that these miracles 
are taking place and if there is another miracle

155
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,419
that has to take place it will take place 
in any case.

156
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,329
We are not doing anything, it is all done.

157
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,959
And we don't doubt it.

158
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:15,550
Once you doubt you become again the same human 
being which is just embedded in the mud.

159
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:22,120
I always say that you are like lotuses now 
opened out.

160
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,100
You are not flying in the air.

161
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,910
Your roots are down there.

162
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:37,730
But you are now lotuses, and that's what is 
on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle

163
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,190
is born.

164
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:52,819
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came 
on this earth as Sitaji, as Radha and also

165
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:58,829
as Mary, as Mother Mary.

166
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:03,360
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of 
the sea.

167
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,150
What is the meaning of "Mary"?

168
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,230
Maria means, you know, Mare means "the sea".

169
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:16,290
She was born out of the sea.

170
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,430
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could 
create a child.

171
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,520
What's the harm?

172
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:35,250
She could do anything, and this is the thing 
you have to rise above.

173
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:41,970
Christians have to rise above this Christianity, 
and has to understand that it's such a great

174
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,380
thing that was Christ Who came on this earth, 
Who was the Incarnation of the principle of

175
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,480
Ganesha.

176
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,790
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big 
thing which one should try to understand.

177
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,450
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

178
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:18,370
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created 
before creating anything, any atmosphere,

179
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:28,480
anything, because He is the Omkara, and the 
Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti

180
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
from Shiva.

181
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,610
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.

182
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:41,069
From there started Omkara and He is the One 
Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

183
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:50,069
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power, 
was created first foremost thing, just to

184
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,579
create holiness [SOUNDS LIKE povitrada].

185
00:16:53,579 --> 00:17:00,560
When this holiness was created, this [povitrada] 
was created, then everything was created in

186
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,549
the sea of that holiness.

187
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:20,230
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu, 
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

188
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,370
And who is Vishnu?

189
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:28,720
Is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

190
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

191
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:45,360
So He was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu, 
we can say, but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle

192
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,170
of Shri Ganesh.

193
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,180
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the 
Shri Ganesha is connected on the left hand

194
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:05,580
side to the Ida Nadi, and the Kundalini is 
above that.

195
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:14,040
So now what has happened is this, that He 
transcended that part, and if He had to come

196
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:21,030
for the redemption, He had to come as the 
Son of Mahalakshmi.

197
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:27,890
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him, or 
we should say really, conceived Him within

198
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:38,510
Himself as Christ, and He became Mahavishnu.

199
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:46,910
Anything is possible in the family of Gods 
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

200
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:58,420
It is beyond human mind to understand how 
these things are working out in that realm.

201
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,270
Very difficult.

202
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,430
But now you have got Realization you can feel 
in the cool breeze, so many new things are

203
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,820
happening to you.

204
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:16,800
So now believe Me, that there is no unholy 
alliances among the Gods and Goddesses, no

205
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,860
unholy alliances.

206
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,170
There is nothing that is human in them.

207
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,940
They're all divine, pure people.

208
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:40,520
Once you understand this point then you will 
understand why Shri Ganesha had to accept

209
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:50,419
to be a Son of Mahalakshmi, was born to Him 
as Christ.

210
00:19:50,419 --> 00:20:02,310
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the 
redemption as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption

211
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:12,740
part, because at that stage He is for the 
innocence, for the holiness, for the wisdom

212
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,860
or also for destroying the negativity.

213
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:30,180
But He had to come up, only He, only Ganesha 
could be brought to this very constricted

214
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:36,540
chakra, Agnya chakra.

215
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,990
Now why is it constricted?

216
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,431
It's quite a scientific thing which I would 
not like to discuss today.

217
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:48,820
But it had to be constricted and it goes on 
getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

218
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:57,410
the more, the more we think, the more we go 
into the left or right, it goes on really

219
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,130
becoming like this, absolutely like this.

220
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:11,710
So in this very subtle area only Christ could 
be subtle, because He's the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:22,670
He's even subtler than an atom, because in 
the atom those vibrations which move asymmetric

222
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,680
and symmetric movements are subtler than the 
atom.

223
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,450
And this is the subtler of that also.

224
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:45,050
So in that little very constricted area, only 
a personality like Christ, which is nothing

225
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,200
but purity.

226
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:59,890
There is no other element in Him but purity.

227
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:10,350
All other Incarnations have all the five elements 
in it.

228
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,350
He has nothing.

229
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:17,240
He is nothing but pure vibrations.

230
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:25,160
That's why He could walk on the water, because 
there was no mass in His body, no matter in

231
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
His body.

232
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,010
No matter.

233
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:34,650
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

234
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:43,460
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud, or the 
what you can say, the thing that came out

235
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
of Her body.

236
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,270
Only the Chaitanya.

237
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:56,230
So at Ganesha's stage we can say that the 
Chaitanya was kept in that form, but in the

238
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:03,270
state of Christ it was not there.

239
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:12,590
But the whole drama was played later on, of 
His death and resurrection, because He is

240
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,900
the One who is responsible for our resurrection, 
because He is the Gate.

241
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,090
He's the Path because He's Shri Ganesh.

242
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:30,560
Omkara is the Path, and He's the Gate, but 
He is not the destination.

243
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,310
His Mother is the destination.

244
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:39,130
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.

245
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,380
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

246
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:48,260
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where 
you have to reach.

247
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:54,100
All these things were never told in the Bible, 
because He could hardly live for four years

248
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,630
with public life.

249
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:05,220
Nor did they want to tell about it because 
they did not know, also there was a definite

250
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:13,270
suppression of all Divine things, for these 
people are all commercialized institutions,

251
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,650
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial 
institutions.

252
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,410
But the only advantage in India is that religion 
is not organized.

253
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,440
Thank God for that!

254
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,440
But they organized it, they organized Christ, 
they organized all His principles, everything,

255
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,270
and now they think He was a good human being.

256
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,770
What a certificate to give Him!

257
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:46,190
So today we are here to celebrate the birth 
of Omkara.

258
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,240
It's a very big thing.

259
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,920
I don't know if you can realize it, what it 
is, which moves into everything, whether it

260
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:04,400
is [SOUNDS LIKE anu, paramanu], is the atom, 
molecules, into all the organizing of chemicals

261
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:15,550
and also the periodic laws, and also in the 
gravity, into every thing that moves is this

262
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,940
Omkara, and your vibrations are nothing but 
Omkaras.

263
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,620
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations 
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,590
On the head of the people there is Omkara 
written.

265
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:37,650
How is it happening, these lights look like 
Omkara?

266
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:43,330
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja 
Yogis, there's all the Sahaja Yogis' heads,

267
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:55,900
there is Omkara? - or Allah in Arabic language 
- My name also, in Arabic.

268
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,550
Who is doing this?

269
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:06,780
It is He who is doing all this.

270
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:15,490
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things 
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

271
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:22,270
He's the One who is handling all these powers.

272
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:31,600
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no, 
He does not, but He plays a trick.

273
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,100
After all you see, if you go into details, 
how do you get a photograph?

274
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,130
Through the light.

275
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,420
The light passes straight, a straight line.

276
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,510
But if He wants He can make the light pass 
another way round.

277
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,309
He can just transform the light into something 
else.

278
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:56,860
He can do whatever He likes.

279
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,200
And that's what He does to convince you.

280
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,990
And He said that: "Anything against Me I'll 
tolerate, but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

281
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:15,120
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

282
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:22,370
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

283
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,350
So that in the whole play He is like the [SOUNDS 
LIKE sutra dhara], He's the One who is the

284
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:34,810
conductor, the One moves the strings in a 
puppet show.

285
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:41,070
And so it is very important to pray to Shri 
Ganesha every time we have Puja.

286
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:48,910
We have to pray to Him and we, that's how 
we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ.

287
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,910
Every time.

288
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,260
Without His auspiciousness, without His help, 
we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,730
He's the Manager.

290
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,730
See I'm sitting here and He's the manager.

291
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:06,020
Supposing there's no management how will I 
speak here?

292
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,280
Nothing can happen.

293
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,790
But He is so efficient, and you never see 
Him working out everything, doing everything.
