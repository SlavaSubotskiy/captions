[Music]

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,629
this understanding of what you have

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,860
achieved in sahaja yoga should

4
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:50,580
immediately make you realize what you

5
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:53,980
are and when it all has happened to us

6
00:00:50,580 --> 00:01:01,120
automatically you should be very sincere

7
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:04,720
about it you must feel that something

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:10,450
really we have achieved or something so

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:15,250
great so we have to be sincere mentally

10
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:18,600
also we should feel that so this is

11
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:23,710
first thing you do is to mentally feel

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:30,869
to maintain you feel that it's so

13
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:38,740
important but the second part is

14
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:43,030
different where you see something you

15
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:47,109
know something and you start opening

16
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:51,509
your heart about it in the second part

17
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:54,579
you have to open your heart

18
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:59,950
so the sincerity comes from an open

19
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:03,100
heart if your heart is not open you

20
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,469
cannot be sincere now what does it mean

21
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,469
that your heart is not open let us see

22
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:17,900
we are born again you have got your

23
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:24,769
realization also it is your birthday in

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:28,609
a way but in the growth of your

25
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:33,620
knowledge and understanding you have not

26
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:36,799
kept pace with your heart but what is

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:43,879
the reason for that what is it that

28
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:47,840
keeps your heart like you can discover

29
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:54,159
very easily that your heart moves the

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:03:01,159
body moves your brain everything because

31
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:04,849
if your heart stops everything stops but

32
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,010
if your brain stops hardcore stuff so

33
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:12,200
heart is the most important thing and it

34
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:19,609
governs the whole being within you now

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:29,629
this special instrument which is very

36
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:30,909
delicate which circulates also is like a

37
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,840
stone

38
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,840
how will it pulsate

39
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:46,090
so when we say enlarge your heart it

40
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,090
means that the stone enos of your heart

41
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:55,230
has to be melted away how does it become

42
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:55,230
stony we have to go to the roots of that

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:05,500
it becomes like a stone because the

44
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:08,470
heart controls the brain as there are

45
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,870
seven auras on your brain in the same

46
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:16,390
way there are seven auras on your heart

47
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:25,090
and all those are us and the ones which

48
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:28,210
control them on us of the wave now on

49
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,470
the brain as you know there are two

50
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:36,160
institutions of ego and conditionings we

51
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:39,960
start pressing the brain too much as a

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,960
result of all these auras get dressed

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,410
so the auras which are surrounding the

54
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:58,870
heart also the treasure so this

55
00:04:47,410 --> 00:05:04,210
conditioning makes the brain pervert but

56
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:12,310
it doesn't make it a stone only what

57
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:14,460
makes it a stone is that if he is born

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,580
with some sort of a mental derangement

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,650
that he cannot think otherwise the brain

60
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,780
goes on thinking whether with

61
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:29,550
conditionings or with it it goes on

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:29,550
thinking such a brain

63
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:39,760
should not affect the heart because

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:43,000
heart affects a brain but the auras

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:50,330
which are manifested from the heart

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,090
start becoming dull or disappear so the

67
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,350
auras around the heart are very

68
00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:03,010
sensitive and they feel no use throwing

69
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:05,900
light on the brain they start becoming

70
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,910
smaller and smaller and that's how the

71
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,970
heart becomes small because they have no

72
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:16,940
purpose in life them so they start

73
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,790
becoming smaller and smaller as a result

74
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,220
the heart becomes small we call somebody

75
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,010
is really small hearted fellow is a

76
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,270
chicken hearted you know we always say

77
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:34,130
such a man is a stone hearted person all

78
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:36,980
these happens because of the

79
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:46,220
conditionings and the ego of the human

80
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:50,090
mind and the result is felt but the

81
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:55,400
heart becoming a stone because heart is

82
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:59,870
a sensitive thing brain is not that that

83
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:02,080
is how we do not know how to be kind to

84
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,880
others how to be nice how to be helpful

85
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:18,410
how to be gentle and how to be

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:21,260
reassuring protecting others all this we

87
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,540
have inherited already we have already

88
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,970
got a stone art when we come to sahaja

89
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,570
yoga and we have a brain either full of

90
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:32,870
ego or super-ego so now with your

91
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:36,530
Kundalini rising you can clear out your

92
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:40,150
head first of all so the sincerity will

93
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,710
come when the Kundalini will move and

94
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,270
touch

95
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:48,589
Ramananda which is the seat of your

96
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,990
heart and will expand then the heart

97
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:55,369
just comes back like a king returns back

98
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,129
and start dominating the brain so the

99
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:59,389
relationship between the truth has to be

100
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,520
fully understood

101
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,189
at first the domination of the heart

102
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,779
although we can say the king hood of

103
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:11,449
heart is cherished is put down not to

104
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:17,770
zero and then this brain becomes the

105
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:25,189
king and he starts ruling us I think I

106
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:33,169
feel means the brain the even if you

107
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:36,800
could give up I think I want everything

108
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:41,509
with your eyes you should say I want

109
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,729
another point this body wants you

110
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,880
separate yourself gradually you start

111
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:49,399
separating yourself from all such

112
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,860
situations by never saying I want you

113
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:57,139
say this body this heart

114
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:00,139
they said you start separating and once

115
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:04,519
you are separated all these barriers of

116
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:08,149
ego and super-ego will disappear but as

117
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,329
it is also it's very easy to get rid of

118
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,209
these two it's very easy to get rid of

119
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:19,490
these two only by raising your kundalini

120
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:22,009
and breaking here Ramanathan this is the

121
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,560
greatest achievement that you know that

122
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,410
you can break your brahmarandra

123
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,269
make your kundalini get connected with

124
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,250
the all-pervading power that's why I

125
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,560
always say you must meditate and you

126
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,319
must be in thoughtless awareness then it

127
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,939
works out don't pay attention to outside

128
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:40,910
things so much tasting you should

129
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:43,040
decorate yourself within yours with

130
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,699
sincerity it nice thoughts about

131
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,250
yourself that you are capable absolutely

132
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:54,840
capable people and you can use your

133
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,820
imagination you are

134
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,560
intelligence rationality whatever you

135
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:04,770
think you have to find the way to find

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,430
the way again I say to keep your heart

137
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,430
large
