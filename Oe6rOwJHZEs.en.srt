1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:15,240
Tonight we had decided to talk about Creation
but our management has not been able to provide

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:27,180
me with a chalk and with a blackboard so,
I don’t know, I’ll try to explain it without

3
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,180
drawing.

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,099
It’s a very difficult subject.

5
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:40,550
And I’ll try to make it intelligible.

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:01:05,760
But I would request you to pay full attention
for such a difficult subject like Creation.

7
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:16,580
The greatest blessing today is that many of
you can feel the vibrations.

8
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:25,440
And not only that but you also know and realise
that they can think and they can love.

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,090
It’s a very big blessing.

10
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,750
Of course, some of you haven’t got it, but
those who have got it know that these vibrations

11
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,130
organise, because they raise the Kundalini,
they go to the place where it is needed, out

12
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,900
of compassion, to that portion where there
is deficiency.

13
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,870
They understand, they organise they are universal
in nature and they love.

14
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:59,979
They answer to your questions, when you ask
them some questions – you receive answer

15
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,710
from them.

16
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,180
They are living vibrations.

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,319
These vibrations are from the Divine.

18
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:24,900
This Divine is called as Brahma, Brahma Tattwa,
Principle of Divine.

19
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:39,109
We can say that the process of Creation is
an eternal process.

20
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:43,450
Means a seed becomes a tree and the tree becomes
a seed, and the seed becomes a tree, and it

21
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,529
goes on and on – it’s eternal.

22
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:51,969
So, it cannot have a starting point and it
cannot have an ending point.

23
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:54,760
It goes on and on and on.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,499
That’s why it can have different states
of existence, you can say, state of being.

25
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:07,430
So, the first, just the being, is Brahma,
where nothing exists.

26
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,430
We say ‘nothing’.

27
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:17,299
When we say nothing, it is a relative word:
because we do not exist, so we say ‘nothing

28
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,519
exists’ – it’s a relative word.

29
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,879
When we are not existing, for us everything
is ‘nothing’.

30
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,879
There is something, but that is not ourselves.

31
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,849
And that’s why, relatively, we say it is
‘nothing’.

32
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,079
It’s only the word Brahma, we can say.

33
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:47,790
You can think of an energy, if you want to,
an energy-form that exists.

34
00:03:47,790 --> 00:04:00,689
But the energy accumulates at a point and
forms a nucleus.

35
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:12,379
The energy that thinks, energy that is distributed,
accumulates at a point, concentrates on a

36
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:20,910
point, you can say, and this point is the
point we call as Sadashiva.

37
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,450
This happens because that energy desires,
thinks, organises, loves.

38
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:41,990
When it wants to create, when the desire is
felt in that energy to create, at that time

39
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:47,480
a nucleus is created.

40
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
This nucleus we call as Sadashiva.

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
This nucleus does not disappear.

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,890
You can think of a nebula.

43
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,540
I mean, it is something which is all relative
you can think, you cannot think something

44
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,760
in absolute form.

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,190
So, with thinking you cannot conceptualise
the whole thing, but if you can think of a

46
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:16,020
state, where it’s just an energy and no
creation.

47
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,110
But not the energy of electricity, magnetism
– all these things.

48
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:26,080
Is the combination, the synthesis of all the
things which goes into laya which becomes

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,740
that, dissolves into that.

50
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:44,580
It coagulates on a point, that may be a [suitable]
word, coagulates at a point which we can call

51
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,580
as a nucleus.

52
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,710
This point we call as Sadashiva.

53
00:05:52,710 --> 00:06:05,050
This Sadashiva is the Ishwara, is the God
Almighty.

54
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,410
We call it now “God” because now it has
a limitation.

55
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,300
In the sense that we can call it something.

56
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,340
But if it is just an energy we just call it
a Brahma.

57
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:26,170
You can say like this: when the water becomes
ice, a follicle of ice is formed, you can

58
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:34,250
differentiate between the water and the ice,
but still, it’s a relative, relative understanding.

59
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:45,680
At this state God Almighty, Parameshwara,
takes its form as an identity.

60
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,120
That’s why we can say that it is not Brahma,
but an identity.

61
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,620
Identity has its aura, has its aura, we can
say, its light.

62
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,720
This light is the Divine Love.

63
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:15,230
It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains
as He is.

64
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:28,120
Now, the desire to create is transferred to
the aura.

65
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,700
The aura is the Power of God, Shakti.

66
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:45,730
Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also
and before Him.

67
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:55,150
God Almighty has something beyond Him that
He cannot control: one, He cannot control

68
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,800
His eternal nature.

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,760
It is His nature to be eternal, He cannot
stop it.

70
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,730
He will go on changing His form, it is His
nature, it just… it is His swabhava.

71
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,940
He cannot change it, His eternal nature.

72
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
He will be eternally.

73
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,169
Eternity is His temperament, His nature, He
cannot overcome that.

74
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:26,400
For example, God cannot take away your freedom
to choose the Truth.

75
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
He cannot.

76
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,880
Once He has granted, He’s not going to take
it away.

77
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,889
You have to choose it in all your freedom.

78
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,490
He will not force you to take it.

79
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,550
Many people have hopes like that – they
are sadly mistaken.

80
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:46,850
At this juncture only lies the problem of
complete destruction or complete resurrection.

81
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,769
It is left into the hands of human beings
to decide whether they want to accept the

82
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:57,360
Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood.

83
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,249
So, you have [been] given complete freedom
to choose.

84
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:08,540
I won’t go into the details about God Almighty,
because it’s a very subtler subject and

85
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,910
requires much more attention.

86
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,560
I have talked about it before to many people
and all His nature, they know that.

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,449
But He is the Witness, He is the Sakshi (witness)
in the form of a Sakshi.

88
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:25,519
What is He witnessing?

89
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,370
He is witnessing the Creation.

90
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,819
And the power that creates the Creation is
the Shakti, is His power, is His consort.

91
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:46,079
Now, for us, human beings, we don’t understand
that a wife and a husband could be that one

92
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,079
(unified).

93
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,920
For example, you can understand like a Sun
and a sunlight, Moon and the Moonlight – as

94
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,269
these two things are one and the same.

95
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,339
Or the meaning and the word.

96
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:58,910
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are one
together.

97
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:05,209
For example, you can be a father, you can
be a mother.

98
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:13,119
You can be a father, you can be a brother,
you can be a son – three things you are

99
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,360
doing together.

100
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,029
In the same way, you can be your Self and
your power.

101
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:24,050
You know: you and your Self and your power
are different, but you are one.

102
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:28,560
You have a power to write, but you are not
your power.

103
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,370
Neither your power is your Self.

104
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:41,300
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are two
persons to be identified, but they are part

105
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,470
and parcel of one uniform thing known as ‘Brahma’.

106
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:54,459
But these horrible Tantrikas – again they
come round here – have spoiled the relationship

107
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,230
between Shiva and Shakti.

108
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,100
Not that they were human beings, that’s
why they established all these funny ideas

109
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,160
and talked about these nonsensical things.

110
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
Because they are the people who are nothing
but their sex-points.

111
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,490
They are nothing nobler than that.

112
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,180
They are very depraved and diseased and debased
people.

113
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,880
They suffer from such a terrible disease that
no way they can see anything else but this.

114
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,550
Ashvameda has also described as something
to do with sex.

115
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,809
Everything they look, they see sex there.

116
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:31,319
It’s like a person, as we call it in Hindi
– [HINDI 13:00 mins] – who is wearing

117
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,899
the glass of sex and watching through that
life, everything becomes sex, sex, sex, they

118
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,350
are such debased and horrible depraved people,
even God, they are bringing to that level.

119
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:47,790
Unless and until they are bringing to that
level, they cannot exist.

120
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,850
How will they justify themselves, the way
they are?

121
00:11:50,850 --> 00:12:00,000
Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,619
What is Sun and sunlight?

123
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:05,399
Is there any sex involved there?

124
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,380
Is there nothing existing without sex for
these horrible tantrikas?

125
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,589
Is there no relationship that exists without
sex?

126
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:25,040
So, Shiva is the God Almighty – we should
call him as Sadashiva.

127
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,639
I’ll try to draw a little bit, let us see
how it works out.

128
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,910
Now forming into a nucleus like this.

129
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:42,809
Now, this is the remains of the nucleus, you
can say, which forms its power here into a

130
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:43,809
valaya.

131
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,160
How does it form?

132
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,230
He moves supposing backwards, you can say.

133
00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:00,700
Then what happens when he moves backwards…kara
noko (marathi: don’t do that)…this, whole

134
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:17,990
thing like this, remains here and all of this
passes, forms a shell around it and the waves

135
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:27,069
cross over and settle onto the shell – here.

136
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:40,679
Now, this is the situation: when all inside
forms another nucleus here by concentration

137
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,139
– this is the Shakti.

138
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:45,139
And this is the Sadashiva.

139
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:51,480
This is the Mahashakti, you can say ‘Adi
Shakti’ and this is the Sadashiva.

140
00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:05,749
Now here, Shiva, once the Shakti forms Her
personality, or we can say, Her ego is established,

141
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:08,110
She is a different identity from Shiva.

142
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,959
Because the whole process is to create the
play for the witness to see.

143
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,869
He is the One who is going to watch the play.

144
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:19,759
She is the One who is going to create it.

145
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:28,860
So, She accumulates Her ego onto a point here
and becomes Shakti, assumes a position there.

146
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:39,350
And the first thing She does as a Shakti is
to go round in a parabolic…in a parabola

147
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,179
around Her Lord.

148
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:44,879
This point one must understand.

149
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,839
She is a Shakti, is the Power of God.

150
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:54,379
And the whole Creation is only meant for God
Almighty to be seen.

151
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:59,339
He’s the only spectator of the play of Shakti.

152
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,779
And if He doesn’t like the play, for example,
He doesn’t like the way it is or the way

153
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:10,279
people are that are created, He can immediately
stop the play by closing His eyes, by denying

154
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:17,220
the play, by showing His annoyance or by His
stopper, He can just stop it.

155
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,649
That’s why He is also called as a destroyer.

156
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,540
But the whole thing is meant for His amusement.

157
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,870
And if it doesn’t give Him pleasure, He
can stop it.

158
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,760
That’s why the first one who must be pleased
is the One who is the spectator.

159
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:48,970
Because of this, Shiva is garlanded by Her,
is a parabola and that’s why parabola is

160
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,860
the symbol of Adi Shakti.

161
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,461
This is sort of a certificate to Her, a sort
of a granting Her the varadan, as we call

162
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:02,600
it in Sanskrit language, is the varadan that
‘go ahead with your work.’

163
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,749
This is a sanction given to Him.

164
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:11,519
When She completes this parabola, the sanction
has been granted and that’s why She is a

165
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,519
parabola.

166
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,869
Here the question of men dominating the women
and women dominating the men does not come

167
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:19,269
in, because this is predominantly in our heads,
you see.

168
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,089
When we think of it, we think of men and women,
it is nothing of the kind.

169
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,470
It’s just complete Oneness.

170
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,600
Can we think of one couple which is absolutely
united with each other?

171
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,670
We cannot.

172
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,550
Because we are all incomplete people.

173
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,920
But if you could stretch your imagination
to such a point that both of them are meant

174
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,829
for each other only and the One who is active,
is the Adi Shakti, is only active to please

175
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:53,989
the God Almighty Who is the only spectator
of Her play and He’s to be pleased first.

176
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:59,540
So, She surrenders Herself before Him, takes
the sanction through the parabola.

177
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,869
Now, parabola is a very important thing.

178
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:08,320
You know that everything travels through parabola,
never in a straight line.

179
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:14,050
For example, if you love someone, our love
goes round that person and comes back to us

180
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,800
as love.

181
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:22,680
But if you hate that person, then our hatred
goes round that person and comes back to us

182
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,340
as a terrible hatred.

183
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:31,830
So, the parabola is taken, but you might say
‘why a parabola?’

184
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,280
The question can be: “Why should there be
a parabola and not a circle?”

185
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,860
The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance
to go round another point, is the shortest.

186
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
And that’s why it’s a parabola.

187
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:54,510
It is even in our ordinary life, you will
find this happening: that whatever you do

188
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,550
to others, it comes back to you in some form,
whether you do good or bad.

189
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:06,160
And that’s why our karmic ideas and that
of our doing punyas are all there.

190
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Because whatever we emit through us, will
come back to us.

191
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,620
In the same way, if you bless the whole world,
the blessings of the whole world will come

192
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,040
to us.

193
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,960
As I told you, the process is not that simple
as it can be drawn, because it’s a living

194
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,240
process of a big dimension but I’m just
trying to make it simpler for you to understand.

195
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:42,650
Now, this parabola, when, here now, when She
is, She goes into the motion of a parabola

196
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:49,300
and Shiva sanctioned Her, sanctions Her – it’s
a living process, again you must understand,

197
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,890
it’s a living process, it’s as human as
we are.

198
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,770
Both of them are as human as we are, we should
say, they are thousand times more human than

199
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,770
we are.

200
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:05,660
So, here the Wife, His Consort, says that:
“I am very happy just like this.

201
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,150
I won’t go any further with it."

202
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,630
Because Creation is not an easy thing for
Her, She doesn’t want to depart from Her

203
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
Creation.

204
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:22,700
Creation is the child and She says, “I would
not like to have children now, because I will

205
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
lose you."

206
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:31,170
So, She pushes Herself towards Him and He
pushes Her back and disappears, opening out

207
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,980
from here.

208
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,410
Now She is in this form.

209
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,870
So, the beginning of the Om starts.

210
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,320
Parabola, first of all, gets converted into
Om.

211
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:59,850
Then She pushes Herself down and settles down
for a while to meditate and to find out how

212
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,170
She is going to work it out, we can say like
this.

213
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,860
You see, it is Her desire which must be aroused.

214
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,990
If Her desire is not aroused, She will not
conceive the Creation.

215
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,230
So, a kalpa is spent in that.

216
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,350
Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking
– which way She should do it.

217
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,850
She has created many universes.

218
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,140
It is not one universe She has created.

219
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,230
She has created universes after universes
and I will show you how She has created so

220
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,230
many universes.

221
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,250
And some of them are still lingering on, some
of them are destroyed.

222
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,360
But today before us: this Universe, this Earth,
on this Earth, India and in India, Delhi,

223
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,260
you are sitting attending this place.

224
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
It’s like that.

225
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,490
So, at this moment, whatever is the thing,
is not the past, nor the future, but I’m

226
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,190
telling you about the present moment we are
here.

227
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,620
But many universes have been created by Adi
Shakti; even before us.

228
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,240
And She has tried many other things also.

229
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,140
Ultimately She has tried this.

230
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,030
She has created Earth and then created us.

231
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,930
Now, how She has done that we’ll see later
on.

232
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:05,820
Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.

233
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:18,460
When She decides to create, She is endowed
with three powers: She has three powers of

234
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,720
God which are granted to Her.

235
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,570
By one power, first of all, is the existence,
the desire to exist, She desires to exist

236
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,790
with God.

237
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:41,750
The second power is to create and the third
power is to sustain.

238
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:52,720
First power is existence, second is to create
and the third is the evolving power or sustenance

239
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,770
power by which gradually you sustain something
and you become something.

240
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,700
These are the three powers She assumes.

241
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:09,980
In short, we can say that She forms three
powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

242
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,650
These are the three powers She assumes within
Herself.

243
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,980
Now, She uses again Her parabolic systems.

244
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,930
You know, supposing, I have come to this house
by this way, I know this way.

245
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,990
Then I take that way, I know that way.

246
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,890
I know the middle way, everything.

247
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,250
Now, I know these three ways and I know all
about it: with that knowledge, I can do something

248
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,250
else.

249
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:37,510
So, She again uses Her parabolic movements.

250
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:45,091
Actually, Her three movements, of Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, are all the

251
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:48,740
time with Her, with the Adi Shakti.

252
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,180
She can separate them and put them into three
different channels.

253
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,980
She can combine them and synthesise them and
use it as a parabola – you understand this?

254
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,490
That’s why when we put a bandhan to you,
we say “put a parabola,” is a parabola,

255
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,550
because the vibrations are all in… all the
three powers are flowing this way.

256
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:16,950
So, we have got, you know that, three powers
– the Mahakali power you can say, I need

257
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,950
not write, “Mahakali power”.

258
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,680
By Mahakali power She desires, as I’ve told
you, is the emotional side of God, you can

259
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
say.

260
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,560
She represents the emotional side of God,
She desires.

261
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,600
Is the desire is that of God.

262
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,000
God Almighty, Who is the spectator, He is
the Sakshi.

263
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,080
And She puts that Sakshi into your heart,
She reflects that into your heart which is

264
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,000
kept all the time burning to watch what you
are doing.

265
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,380
To see your play after your creation.

266
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,540
Her Mahasaraswati power, now, moves in a parabola.

267
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:11,970
She can move in any angle, 360 angles She
can move, from one point.

268
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,610
Sometimes, She goes round and round at a point.

269
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:29,250
When She goes round and round at a point,
Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated;

270
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,840
you can say, it becomes dense.

271
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,190
You see, that’s the trouble with English
language!

272
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:51,430
It becomes dense, it becomes so very dense
that it cracks out.

273
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:58,110
These cracks occur due to the momentum of
the movement of the Mahakali power, Mahasaraswati

274
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,110
power.

275
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,380
Because it is moving in a round and round
fashion, they also get into the momentum of

276
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,230
that movement, they start moving.

277
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,150
For example, this part starts moving, this
part starts moving, this part starts moving.

278
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:16,250
And when they start moving, they become rounds,
they lose their angularities and then they

279
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,380
become round.

280
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,730
Now I’m telling you, very much in short
because it’s a…they become round.

281
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,910
These rounds again are put into friction with
each other.

282
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,880
And that is how, we can say – now forget
about other universes, where other styles

283
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,010
were also created – but about this one we
can say, was created.

284
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:42,130
Now, you must all the time remember that this
Power thinks, understands, organises, loves

285
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,240
and is an identity.

286
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,440
So, She creates the Earth.

287
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,930
Earth is not created so easily.

288
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:59,320
Part of the Sun is removed just like this,
with the hand, you can say.

289
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,700
We must understand why the Sun became so cold.

290
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:11,070
Sun is, from the Sun it is removed very much
far away first, to the farthest point so that

291
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,150
it freezes completely.

292
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,590
Also like Moon, it was taken very far away.

293
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,640
It just freezes completely and is then brought
near the Sun again, like a pendulum.

294
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:27,490
It is moved again towards the cold side, again
it is brought to the hot side.

295
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:34,620
It is brought to a point, to the medium point
where Earth is made, is made – again I’m

296
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,490
saying, it’s not a chance of nature – is
made deliberately, habitable for human beings,

297
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,250
the temperature was brought in.

298
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:47,710
It has been done by Adi Shakti, the Mother.

299
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,600
She has done it deliberately, it’s not easy
to conceive of such a Mother.

300
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,350
But She has done it.

301
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,860
And She brings this Earth to a point where
life can begin.

302
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:10,050
So the combination of Moon and the combination
of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon, oxygen

303
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,910
from the sun, gives you water, the freezing
and heating.

304
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,050
The freezing and heating gives you the water.

305
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:25,310
In the water, when the Earth is made, spirally,
to move upward, again the heating and cooling

306
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
starts.

307
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:37,030
By heating and cooling, life comes into being
as amino-acids.

308
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,030
Is done deliberately!

309
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:42,050
What I am saying: it is not done by something,
by chance.

310
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,800
On this also one has to think once: “How
is it?”

311
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
It is not chance!

312
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,555
If you read Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy
(1883-1947)] , is a very big biologist, I

313
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:55,180
mean, I think he’s one of the greatest biologists
who has really gone into the calculations

314
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:10,530
of how much time should it take for a simple
amoeba to be created out of the matter and

315
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,429
he has calculated that it should take much
more time than even what we have had so far

316
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:19,740
– billions of billions of years are needed
just by chance.

317
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,270
Law of chance is there, which I don’t know
if I should tell you elaborately, but law

318
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:33,330
of chance is that, if you have in one tube
50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if

319
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:40,280
you start shaking them and make them absolutely
in a chaotic order, it takes so much, so much

320
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,030
times shaking to make it again the same as
it is, or to bring it into order.

321
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:58,260
So, even to create an orderly living protoplasm,
a cell, would have taken much more time than

322
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,690
it has taken so far: much more, many times
more, billions of billions.

323
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,560
And it has taken only 5 billion years for
Earth to secede from the Moon.

324
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,780
And only 2 billion years for it to cool down.

325
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,490
So, he says, it is beyond any understanding
– only thing that can explain it, what we

326
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,600
can say, is that there is a ‘Juggler’
behind it.

327
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,720
And there is a Juggler, about which our great
rishis and munis know that – that Juggler

328
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,470
is nobody else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial
Mother.

329
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,280
The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the
Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti.

330
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,780
And are we going to discuss about their sex?

331
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,190
Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas?

332
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,430
Is that the way to pay homage to your parents?

333
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,310
We have to understand that it’s a very,
very solemn subject, we are discussing here

334
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,920
the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our
Primordial Parents.

335
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,580
It’s a very, very holy thing.

336
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,590
We are not holy people, we are yet full of
lots of greed and lust, but they are above

337
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,590
everything.

338
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,120
So, when we are discussing them, we have to
know, we have to do it with great shraddha,

339
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:15,300
and with our head bowed before them that it
is our luck and we are very fortunate that

340
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:22,370
we have been able to learn something about
these two Primordial Parents who have brought

341
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:28,480
forth this Creation, their child.

342
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:39,280
So, one of these then again cracks and becomes
a surya-mandal, and a surya-mandala has got,

343
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,920
as you know, Earth and Moon and all these
things and I have told you how Earth is created.

344
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:57,010
After the Creation of Earth, first, you know
that amino-acids were formed, the vegetation

345
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,460
started and then the human being started.

346
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,990
Now, the matter, also, is a very systematic
thing.

347
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,270
Matter is not unsystematic, it is systematic,
but it is not organised – there is difference

348
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,441
between the two.

349
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:12,970
The systematic things are dead, can be dead.

350
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,920
You can put five stones here in a systematic
manner, but they are not organised, because

351
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,980
they are not living things.

352
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,830
There’s a difference between the two.

353
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,990
So, first, the systematic things were laid
down.

354
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:35,750
Perhaps, if you know about the…Eight different
types of elements were created.

355
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:44,420
These were created and were put into proper
places through Shri Ganesha.

356
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:57,250
You know that the carbon… carbon is in the
centre of these periodical elements that appear.

357
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:04,790
That means a element which has got one valency,
two valency, three valency and four valency,

358
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,880
the three are the plus ones, then you’ve
got one C, carbon, which has got four valences.

359
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:18,430
Then you have got, again, minus one, two,
three and four – is a complete eight.

360
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:25,600
Like that, the whole matter has been organised.

361
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,830
To organise the matter, some deity was to
be created for that, and first deity that

362
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,600
was created was that of Shri Ganesh.

363
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:45,140
Let us see now how She created here.

364
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:54,930
You have seen that one part of Her, which
is the Mahasaraswati, has created the matter.

365
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,180
Mahasaraswati has created the matter.

366
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,980
Now, Mahakali has to give them existence.

367
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,550
How do you get an existence?

368
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,090
Is through your sustenance or, you can say,
through your quality – whatever you are.

369
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:18,010
So, Mahakali gives that existence to those
material things, not human beings or living

370
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:32,400
things but matter, through a deity known as
Shri Ganesh.

371
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,290
Mahakali…

372
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,590
In the heart of the Viraata, as you see, – you’ll
see Viraata also He comes in, because that

373
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:48,200
I will tell you later on – but in the heart
of Viraata, is the Primordial Being, the complete

374
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,309
Primordial Being, the Mahakali is settled
down.

375
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:57,040
What She does, She goes three and a half from
the heart: one up, one down like that – three

376
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,510
and a half times and comes to the end of the
three and a half, down-way.

377
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,710
Three and a half.

378
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,030
Now, She comes at the end of it.

379
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,090
And if you put three and a half like that
and if you cut it straight, you get 7 centres

380
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,460
cut in.

381
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:25,220
Is there a drawing person who knows how to
draw?

382
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:39,380
You should start from like that, you can put
it like this.

383
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,550
She comes down here.

384
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,730
She comes down here and from here She penetrates.

385
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:55,440
You see, She cuts at seven points here.

386
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,720
At this point, She creates the first deity,
little below, of Shri Ganesh.

387
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,340
I mean, this is not done in one day, is not
done in one year, not done in one Yuga, it

388
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,920
is done in many Kalpas.

389
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:16,100
The first step is to create Shri Ganesh, this
is Her abode and She puts Shri Ganesh.

390
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,950
Now, he is emitting his vibrations through
all this.

391
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,220
He passes through all this whatever She has
created.

392
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:31,050
On this picture is settled the work of the
Mahasaraswati, you can say.

393
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,619
She comes down with all Her programs like
this and She makes it.

394
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:37,119
And She gets joined here again.

395
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,790
So, Shri Ganesh emits His vibrations through
her.

396
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:46,120
First, Shri Mahakali creates Shri Ganesh and
then Mahasaraswati comes down, She creates

397
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,570
all these things and gets connected to Shri
Ganesh.

398
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:56,740
So, the vibrations of Shri Ganesh start flowing
through all the creation of Mahasaraswati.

399
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:05,720
Before creating all this, the complete thought
of what is going to happen in future comes

400
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,160
in a clear-cut vision of the Adi Shakti.

401
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,890
And She puts Her plans through.

402
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,270
First of all, the Mahalakshmi power comes
down and creates the Shri Ganesh.

403
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:22,360
You can understand now how important it is
that we have to be holy people.

404
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,760
First, She created the holiness on this Earth.

405
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,170
First thing, Her relationship with the child
was established, because the Creation is going

406
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,750
to be created in the image of Her child.

407
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:40,230
That’s why Shri Ganesh was created first.

408
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,619
And then from here, say, is the Adi Shakti,
the other power, Mahasaraswati, on Her way,

409
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,670
She comes down and gets connected with Shri
Ganesh.

410
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,810
And that’s how the Shri Ganesh establishes
the relationship and emits His vibrations

411
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,810
through this.

412
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,740
Because of His vibrations passing through
the matter that She has created.

413
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,780
For example, our Mother Earth: through this
passes the, you know that through it passes

414
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
the axis.

415
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,270
Nobody has seen the axis, but they say, there
is an axis, from the way it moves.

416
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,720
There is a kind of an axis.

417
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,020
Now, this is the power of Mahakali passing
through the [axis].

418
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,390
We can say, it’s the power of Shri Ganesh
passing through the axis of the Mother Earth,

419
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,940
which has got magnetic power in it.

420
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:32,380
And that’s how, through that, it controls
its speed, its movement, and also it looks

421
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
after us.

422
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,730
Why don’t we think that when we put a little
seed in the soil it sprouts, automatically?

423
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,090
You have seen now, many of you who have been
suffering from certain troubles and diseases,

424
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,790
that the Mother Earth herself took down your
problems, She sucked them out.

425
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:55,750
It is a fact, you can see it in Sahaja Yoga,
that after realisation if you have any problem,

426
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,190
if your head is heavy, if you are a realised
soul, otherwise She doesn’t listen, because

427
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:06,160
you should be activated or you should be granted
a certificate from the Adi Shakti that you’re

428
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,290
a realised person, otherwise why should She
accept you?

429
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:16,660
You just put your head on the soil, put your
both the hands on the Mother Earth and you’ll

430
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,240
find the whole thing will be sucked out from
your forehead.

431
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,940
It has been done with many, even from the
legs it can take out.

432
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,810
Mother Earth is actually, is the Mother of
Adi Shakti, you can say.

433
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,661
She is the Mother, they say, because She is
made in such a way that She takes all the

434
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:37,340
weights of the world in Herself.

435
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,961
She controls all the weights of the world
and She can consume all your weight.

436
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:41,961
She’s the dharaa.

437
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:47,040
Now, weight means everything that… your
weight is what we weigh in: that’s not the

438
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
thing.

439
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,740
Weight means also your sins, also your punyas.

440
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
It means everything.

441
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,850
If you have too many sins in you, then Mother
Earth feels hurt.

442
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:01,730
Wherever there is too much of sin, then Mother
Earth has to ask help.

443
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,540
And then some other deity has to, like Vishnu
himself, has to come on this Earth to save

444
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,170
Her from this too much of overloading of sins
upon this Earth.

445
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,170
Is a fact!

446
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,350
It is not I’m telling you a mythical story,
is a fact.

447
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,920
Which you have to verify after getting vibrations.

448
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,250
Before getting vibrations, you cannot find
out from the Mother Earth.

449
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,580
If you want to find out some time, if you
are realised, you just stand on the Mother

450
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,560
Earth and ask her “Will you take away my
sins, oh Mother Earth?

451
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,230
Will you take away my karmas?

452
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,470
I have been realised."

453
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,010
Immediately, She’ll start drawing you.

454
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,010
You’ll be surprised.

455
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,350
You’ll feel so much lighter.

456
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,540
You have to use Her.

457
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,020
That is how Mother Earth has been created.

458
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:45,270
But also Adi Shakti through Her Mahasaraswati
power has created the five elements.

459
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,080
Before everything else, She created tanmatra
(subtle elements) as you call it, I mean,

460
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,850
if I go into details, it’s going to be too
much for you!

461
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,109
But first of all, the causal essences were
created by Her.

462
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:56,240
But if I say like this, there won’t be anything
false.

463
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:04,710
If I say that just by seeing by Her sight,
by her drushti (sight), She has created this

464
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,690
light.

465
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,190
Just by Her breathing, She has created air,
because Her desire is the last point.

466
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,350
Because She desired there should be air, She
created air.

467
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,870
Like that, She has, Her smell has created
the causal, gandha, which has created this

468
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,950
mother Earth.

469
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:30,160
And it has started from Her only, from Her
desires, by Her desiring it – it was created

470
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,930
for Her and that’s how it was created in
the whole Universe, which was later on made

471
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,350
into Earth, Moon, Sun and all these things.

472
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,560
Actually, it was Her mere desire which brought
forth these.

473
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,620
For us it is impossible to understand someone
like that, who, just by mere desire can create.

474
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,880
But when we think of somebody who is above
all the powers of the world, the One the,

475
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,090
who is the highest of all: She can do anything
She feels like.

476
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,740
Can’t we think like that?

477
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,560
We cannot think of someone like that.

478
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,320
We think of God, who is Almighty, we call
Him, but when we talk of His mights we start

479
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
laughing.

480
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
How can it be?

481
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
But She can do anything She wants to.

482
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,220
It is only Her mere desire that has brought
forth all these creations and all this things

483
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,270
that you see in this world are created only
by Her desire.

484
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,830
She created akasha.

485
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:20,190
She created all these five elements, which
you know, and then She started Her another

486
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,430
form which we call as the Mahalakshmi form.

487
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,930
Before that, I think, I should tell you about
Shri Ganesha’s existence in the matter.

488
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,150
He acts in the matter as vibrations, as Mahasaraswati
vibrations.

489
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:38,310
They are electromagnetic vibrations, Mahasaraswati
vibrations are electromagnetic vibrations,

490
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,610
we can say, that electromagnetic and also
there is sound, and all these five elements

491
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,690
are expressed in that.

492
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:54,590
You can record them – because if you take
a sulphur dioxide, for example, a sulphur

493
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:00,369
dioxide and two oxygen and one sulphur and
if you watch them properly under a very highly

494
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:05,820
micro – you can try, I don’t know if people
have tried, but you can try to find out – and

495
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:13,160
put it under, let’s say, a very highly developed
micro – microwave- microscope, you can say,

496
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:20,670
you can see that the oxygen things and sulphur,
– sulphur is stationary, – but these two

497
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,670
are vibrating.

498
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,120
They are vibrating, there’s a vibration
going between these bonds.

499
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,810
They can be isometric also, they can be symmetric,
they can be even, uneven and they can be expanding,

500
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,080
and closing like that.

501
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,280
So, there are three types of vibrations, we
find.

502
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,351
And the fourth side is nothing but Shri Ganesha
himself who is controlling.

503
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:42,940
So, this we can see with our naked eyes, if
you want to see, even if you are realised

504
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
or not.

505
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,970
From where do these vibrations come in the
minutest paramanu, as you call, the molecules?

506
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:53,980
In a molecule, how do you get these vibrations,
can you explain this?

507
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,220
It is so much, sukshma, parasukshma.

508
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:04,630
The powers of Ganesha are very, very subtle
and they enter into the matter and create

509
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:11,570
this kind of vibrations, which you can even
see and record, electromagnetic vibrations,

510
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:18,470
in, even, a one small, little molecule.

511
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:25,800
So, we have in these, as I told you, into
the periodic level, periodic laws of elements,

512
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,890
you can find out that all the elements are
divided into eight types.

513
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,150
Just see!

514
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,480
How can all the elements be divided into eight
parts without somebody being there?

515
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,430
Can you do something without organising a
proper chart of these elements?

516
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,270
Just think about it!

517
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:46,040
You see, when we challenge God, we have to
understand that in this world everything is

518
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,440
so well organised, there are eight elements
spread out so well, placed so well.

519
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,800
And it has a particular style of behaviour
and every element is different in numbers

520
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,110
and protons and these numbers are very well
calculated in such a manner that the end of

521
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:10,890
it, that the last circle, that the last circle
of all the protons should be eight.

522
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,130
If it is not eight, if it is less than eight
then it creates a valency problem.

523
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,820
It is so well organised, then, even if you
study this, if there is anybody who knows

524
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,540
little bit of chemistry, you know, so if you
know chemistry, it’s such a wonderful thing.

525
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,540
We take it for granted!

526
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,619
We think it is our right to have the matter
so well organised for us!

527
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:33,760
But the valencies are all depending on such
a nice organisation of this eight protons

528
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,200
at the outer thing.

529
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,770
This is all done through the Mahasaraswati
power.

530
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:43,650
But the vibrating force…Now see, there is
a vibrating force: this is all done through

531
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,020
the, as I told you, through the Mahasaraswati
power.

532
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,609
She creates.

533
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:51,040
Now the vibrating force: He exists, matter
also exists.

534
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,040
It must exist.

535
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,880
If it does not exist, nothing can exist.

536
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:01,310
So, the existence force is given through the
Mahakali force, which is acting through Shri

537
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,670
Ganesh, who is sitting at the nucleus.

538
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,970
He is sitting at the nucleus of every [atom].

539
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,660
Can you imagine how much it must be?

540
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,330
Every molecule and every atom.

541
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,200
You cannot understand the finiteness of it.

542
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,790
Now, see, say, take one element like gold,
how many molecules it has?

543
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,820
Can you calculate?

544
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,320
[It’s] beyond us!

545
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,690
How many, you can say, atoms it has?

546
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,970
We just cannot calculate it.

547
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,320
And then how many Ganesha’s pictures must
be there?

548
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,050
How is it achieved?

549
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:42,240
Is another thing which I will tell you if
I come in the way.

550
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:50,490
How infinite reflections are caught into and
why there are two things like Shiva and Adi

551
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,490
Shakti?

552
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:54,990
The reason is it has to create an infinite
reflection.

553
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,250
How do you create an infinite reflection?

554
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,260
Do you know that?

555
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,500
Anybody who knows physics?

556
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,170
If you place in the centre of two mirrors
something, then the reflections are infinite.

557
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:20,980
So, the first mirror is the Adi Shakti and
the second mirror is this Creation, and that’s

558
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,030
how you can get infinite reflections on this
Earth.

559
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,640
This is the reason why you can get infinite
reflections.

560
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,540
And that’s why you had to create another
one who reflects it.

561
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,990
And that’s why there have to be three identities,
one, the God Almighty, then Adi Shakti and

562
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,470
then the whole Universe.

563
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,650
It had to be that way, otherwise you cannot
create infinite reflections.

564
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,680
Now, somebody who has done this job must be
a very clever man, no doubt.

565
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,410
When human beings think that they can know
God through their buddhi, they must know,

566
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,910
how can you reach this Buddhi, it’s supreme.

567
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,830
How much labour He has taken to create us!

568
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:16,830
After creating the matter, then He, or I should
say, His power as Mahalakshmi descends on

569
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,890
this Earth.

570
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,030
Mahalakshmi helps in sustenance.

571
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,570
Sustenance means all the scanning of all these
elements.

572
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:36,080
When they create the matter, the matter is
differently created, created for different

573
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,450
purposes.

574
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:43,030
Now, what is the ultimate?

575
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,950
The Creation has its ultimate aim is to create
human beings – this creation, just imagine!

576
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:54,820
You people are so great that for you all these
troubles have been taken.

577
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,380
Such an important thing is a human being that
all these troubles are taken, – all matter,

578
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:05,520
all, everything, is used just to create you.

579
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
This is the ultimate aim.

580
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,570
Sort of a stage has to be laid down and you
come, the Sahaja Yogis come on the scene,

581
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,869
you can say.

582
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:17,000
Just the instrument of man is to be created.

583
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,910
Now, why God wanted to create an instrument
of man?

584
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:29,510
Because He wanted to create an instrument
which could feel Him, which could understand

585
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:36,440
Him, which could emit, like Krishna creating
his murli (flute).

586
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,000
He just wanted to play through our instruments
His power.

587
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,590
But He didn’t want to do it through the
dead instruments like these but through the

588
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,590
living instruments.

589
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:54,710
Supposing, if this (microphone) can understand,
can love, has a human mind, and if my voice

590
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:03,200
is passing through it like a hollow personality
then we can say that this is a realised personality.

591
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,950
But this is not a living being, you are a
living being.

592
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,390
You are made specially with all these difficulties
for millions of years, have been worked out

593
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,420
so carefully, so delicately, one after another.

594
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,740
We have to now jump to the evolution part,
because you see, it’s a very long thing.

595
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:22,000
Shri Mataji: Kiti wasle (Marathi: what time
is it?)

596
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,260
Yogi: Saha wasle (six o’clock)

597
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,450
So, now we have to come to the most important
part which is evolution, which we should understand,

598
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:35,840
because we know evolution through science.

599
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:44,950
When these three forces came into being, before
creating any earth or before creating this

600
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:52,840
universe or anything, first they had to draw
out a proper picture about it and a proper

601
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,210
understanding of it, you see.

602
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,460
As before doing anything, say, we have to
plan out things, we have a planning commission,

603
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,490
first of all, we sit down with a planning
commission.

604
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:05,030
In the same way, first, they had to form a
stage where they just plan out the things.

605
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:08,349
This stage we can call it as the vaikuntha
state.

606
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:13,500
Because this (current stage) is not the earliest
state, this is created later on.

607
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:23,300
First, the planning state is known as the
vaikuntha state.

608
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,020
At this stage they created all the incarnations.

609
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:32,490
Incarnations were not created after the Earth
has been created, which is a very wrong idea.

610
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:36,020
They created all the incarnations at the vaikuntha
state.

611
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:41,820
Where you or I never existed at that time,
this Earth never existed and nothing existed

612
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,940
that you see with your naked eyes now.

613
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,860
But a state of existence, the first one, known
as the vaikuntha state, existed.

614
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:59,470
In that vaikuntha state the planning of the
whole Universe and the whole cosmos and all

615
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,590
that was decided.

616
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:08,290
So, the first person who had to come on this
was Shiva, because without him nothing can

617
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:13,540
exist, but where to settle Him down, because
He is to be reflected onto something.

618
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:18,160
If Shiva has to be reflected onto someone,
you have to create a reflector.

619
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:28,590
So, they had to, first, think of the one Primordial
Being or a, one Huge Identity you can call

620
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,220
it, known as Viraat.

621
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,760
They created Viraata.

622
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,470
This will be the Viraata, this will be the
complete form of the Primordial Being.

623
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,960
This is the one I’m telling you about, this
Reflector, The First One.

624
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,630
The God Almighty has to be reflected, so,
first, let us create, first of all, the Primordial

625
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,140
Being, the Viraat.

626
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:58,940
In the Viraat they created different incarnations.

627
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,780
Incarnations are not created from human beings.

628
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,190
I don’t know why people think like that.

629
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,910
They cannot be created by human beings.

630
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:06,950
But they were first created.

631
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:12,080
You see, evolution is alright from amoeba
to human beings, but there is no evolution

632
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,560
for incarnations.

633
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:18,660
They are made like that from the very beginning.

634
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:29,190
As you have seen in the Viraata, I have shown
you the picture of the Viraat, the three powers

635
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:38,540
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati
met at the Agya Chakra, and there they produced

636
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:47,060
two children each – it’s not a story,
is a fact, again – as brothers and sisters.

637
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:56,580
And these brothers and sister means the relationship
is of a temporary nature but of a subtler

638
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,580
temperament.

639
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,720
And then they were married, inter-communication
took place.

640
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:12,570
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali created
all together six children, who were married.

641
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,810
Inter-marriage took place.

642
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:25,100
By that inter-marriage they got an entity
which was a kinetic personality and a potential

643
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,690
energy within it, such a combination.

644
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,440
And they placed those incarnations on different
chakras.

645
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:39,980
They brought from these, from the top, all
of them were brought from the Agya downward

646
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,060
and placed onto all the chakras.

647
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:50,820
These incarnations, as you know, are placed
on different chakras of the Viraata.

648
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:56,130
Many people won’t understand this and won’t
like to hear this also, because human beings

649
00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:02,840
are so egoistical that they cannot understand
that there is a God, Who is Almighty, Who

650
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,180
is going to do everything, He has His own
ways of doing it.

651
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,550
Now, whether I’m telling the Truth or not,
you can verify it on vibrations.

652
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,220
You can see for yourself how Incarnations
were created.

653
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:21,090
And all these Incarnations were placed in
the Viraata state.

654
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:34,010
Here, to create the reflection on the other
side, Shiva was removed from the Shakti, as

655
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:39,270
it was removed in the beginning and it was
placed on top of the Viraata’s head as the

656
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,270
Sadashiva’s peetha.

657
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,180
In the same way, we, too, have a Sadashiva’s
peetha on our head.

658
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,410
You see, we are the reflection of the reflector.

659
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:52,990
So, we, too, have the same style, we, too,
have a Sadahsiva’s peetha on our head.

660
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:55,150
He’s also placed here only.

661
00:54:55,150 --> 00:55:06,619
But when the Kundalini enters into the being,
when he is in the womb of the mother, that

662
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:13,410
time this Sadashiva peetha, or we can say,
Sadashiva from this peetha descends into the

663
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,810
heart.

664
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:20,670
And that’s how you hear the first throb
in the heart.

665
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,820
It is just the same as it happened in the
Viraata.

666
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,740
But at the vaikuntha stage this was not created,
the second reflector here was not created,

667
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,300
only the first one.

668
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:40,349
So, only the Viraata was created and in His
Being, in the planning stage, first of all,

669
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:46,369
these officers, you can say, in charge of
these chakras were created by Adi Shakti.

670
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:52,730
God is the witness and She is doing the play
and She creates those chakras.

671
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,520
In the chakras She places all these deities
to govern.

672
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:08,070
Now, there is the existence, there is the
creation, creative force, and there is the

673
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,570
evolutionary force – all inside the Viraata
state.

674
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:16,480
Now, this is at the vaikuntha state, we say,
because this state is on this first reflection.

675
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:27,660
It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the
vaikuntha state, because it is in the first

676
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,660
thing.

677
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,310
Then another state was created, then third
was created.

678
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:36,360
But the fourth one is the bhavasagara, is
the state at which all of us were born.

679
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:43,040
First, in the fourth state…now, can you
think of a four strata personality which is

680
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,600
facing a mirror?

681
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,800
Now, which is the first one [that] shows?

682
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Is the topmost.

683
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,640
And that’s why the topmost shows is the
bhavasagara.

684
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,010
But if you can go deep down into your state,
you can feel all the other three.

685
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,620
But first of all, the one which you can see
and feel it, is the bhavasagara.

686
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,640
So, you are born in the bhavasagara.

687
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,430
At this state you are at the bhavasagara state.

688
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:11,530
At this bhavasagara state, now, you are created
and you have to evolve.

689
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:15,270
At this time the Mahalakshmi power acts to
evolve you.

690
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:21,359
You already know how evolutionary things have
taken place but I will tell you how evolution

691
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,869
has taken place according to our puranas (ancient
scriptures), and which is a fact.

692
00:57:24,869 --> 00:57:34,580
The Evolution of Man started, first from the
amoeba, you can say; because the life came

693
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,500
into being into water, as I told you [that]
first the water was created.

694
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,080
In the water the amino-acids were formed,
amoeba were formed, fishes were formed and

695
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:49,230
fishes, when they were formed, they found,
the smaller fishes found it difficult to exist

696
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,960
because of the bigger fishes were trying to
eat it.

697
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,390
It comes as a reciprocal thing, they were
absolutely fed up of this destruction that

698
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,450
was going on.

699
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:05,130
At this time, Shri Vishnu Himself, the One
who is the evolutionary force, descended on

700
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,880
this Earth as the Matsya-Avatara.

701
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,660
He helped some of the fishes to cross across
the shores.

702
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,460
By crossing across they had that courage,
She was the leader.

703
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,860
And then others started crossing across.

704
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,589
This was the first evolutionary stage which
we know.

705
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:27,320
These fishes became reptiles later on; as
you know, in the evolutionary stages that

706
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,660
they became reptiles.

707
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,210
But how did they become reptiles?

708
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,900
There must be someone who must have given
them the lead.

709
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:39,950
It was again Shri Vishnu, who came on this
Earth as a Kurma and lots of things were done

710
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:45,750
at this time in the vaikuntha stage, before
He came on this Earth as a Kurma Avatara.

711
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:51,270
At the vaikuntha stage, when they created
this Earth, when they created, they planned

712
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:56,990
this whole Viraata and wanted to create, on
this side of the reflector the whole planning

713
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:02,910
and the whole thinking and all that process
brought forth some sort of a waste matter.

714
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,150
It brought forth the waste matter.

715
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:11,360
This waste matter got contaminated or, we
can say, got stagnated on to one side which

716
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,532
was neglected somehow, and through it started
coming out some satanic forces and there was

717
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:20,630
a big fight between the satanic forces and
the good forces.

718
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:25,030
It actually happened in the third stage, not
at the vaikuntha stage, but at the third stage,

719
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:28,420
because when the planning started, the working
out started, these satanic forces started

720
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,420
working out.

721
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,410
Now, people may say, “Why God created satanic
forces?”

722
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:38,090
He did not, but eventually they turned out
to be because at the second stage, when some

723
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,560
of the Devas, who were created.

724
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,960
Again, they were not evolved people, they
were created, Devas, in charge of all these

725
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,020
elements and all the working, you see, you
have to create also officers or people who

726
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,760
have to go in the field and work out.

727
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,040
All these Devas and Devatas: out of their
working, what happened [is] that they got

728
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,710
lost, some of them, and became satanic forces.

729
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:01,770
Sort of a waste-product came in, and with
that waste-product, satanic forces started

730
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:08,790
and they acted in such a way that there was
a war during the Kurma-Avatara between Rakshasas

731
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,150
and the Suras, as they call it.

732
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,430
So, the good people who were in charge of
the elements, all the working in the office

733
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:17,440
of God started fighting with the satanic forces.

734
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,410
At that time, He Himself worked out this and
you know what happened in the amrut-mantan

735
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,960
which took place, and this is, – people
don’t understand how can the amrut-mantan

736
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,810
take place in the bhavasagara, – it did
not.

737
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:36,180
It took place at a stage which is not bhavasagara.

738
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,510
At the bhavasagara it did not take place.

739
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,330
Now, we are at the bhavasagara state.

740
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:45,073
At the bhavasagara state the same Kurma, the
same one took birth and came on this Earth

741
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:48,940
and gave us a understanding how to become
a proper reptile.

742
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,260
Like that we grew up.

743
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,460
So, the whole thing will take too much time,
I need not go into that.

744
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,710
But, ultimately, a human being was created.

745
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:01,180
All this is done by Mahalakshmi power, which
has acted through Vishnu, which I have told

746
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:09,010
you how evolution has taken place, how you
are made.

747
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:11,190
Now, what is going to happen?

748
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,750
You reach this point, up to this point, till
Christ came in.

749
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,890
Christ was also an incarnation and his Mother
was nobody else but Radhaji Herself, the Mahalakshmi.

750
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:21,380
And they brought forth up to this stage the
human beings.

751
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,349
After this, now, what man has to become?

752
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:32,420
– is to enter into a state where he becomes
nirvichar, means there is no more the consciousness

753
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,760
of the bhavasagara, but you go little beyond
it.

754
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:45,720
From this stage you dive into a state of Universal
Unconscious, as they call it, it’s nothing

755
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,950
but the same power which exists here, which
is a synthesis of all the three powers, is

756
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,950
the synthesis of all the three powers.

757
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,410
That is the Adi Shakti’s power.

758
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:58,220
Adi Shakti’s power is all-pervading, exists
everywhere, but we never feel it otherwise.

759
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,220
Why?

760
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,630
Because we are very grossly placed.

761
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:06,420
We can say, that a tube, which has got, say
four layers, out of which it can only use

762
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,760
the outer tube, because the inner tubes are
all closed.

763
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,859
When the innermost tube is opened out, you
become absolutely Self-realised, but when

764
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:20,270
even the second tube is opened out, you can
feel the all-pervading force of God Almighty,

765
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:24,410
which is, we call it as Sampovapi achetan.

766
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:28,859
But it is no more achetan (unconscious) for
you because you are conscious of it.

767
01:02:28,859 --> 01:02:31,359
That is how you start your dialogue with God.

768
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,359
What happens is that here, the reflection
here, the reflector, that is reflecting work,

769
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:38,940
from here you ascend into this part.

770
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,530
You ascend onto this part.

771
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:46,070
You do not become this but you ascend into
this area.

772
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,650
From here you ascend into this area.

773
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:55,520
And this area is filled with the all-pervading
power of Adi Shakti.

774
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:01,230
Till you reach to this stage, you have to
go up to this stage of an incarnation, which,

775
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,760
of course, is a big gap.

776
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:08,520
But I can say that Mahavira and Buddha, both
of them rose to that height.

777
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,580
But look at their disciples!

778
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,410
For example, Buddha’s disciples, they have
decried Shiva, they have decried all the Gods

779
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,920
and Goddesses, I mean as if they did not know
much about it.

780
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:22,130
And the way they have shown in certain statues
– that a Goddess is standing on top of a

781
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,260
Shiva and a Parvati and is trying to kill;
She is hitting Shri Ganesha and this is something

782
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,260
so non-sensical.

783
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:32,670
I mean, they completely killed the image of
One United Force, acting the whole thing,

784
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,030
in One united idea, with One united mind.

785
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:39,980
Only whenever they had not united, they became
Rakshasas and formed the satanic force.

786
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:44,300
As I told you it’s a very, very difficult
subject and I’ve tried to handle it in English,

787
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,300
is even worse.

788
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,750
So, I’ve tried my level best to do it, but
still if you have any questions, anything,

789
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:53,420
you can ask me, some time, you can write to
me, we can find it out.

790
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,200
For tomorrow…Now, this is the only thing
is, I wanted to tell you about this, that

791
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,660
now you have got thoughtless awareness, no
doubt.

792
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,750
Most of you have got thoughtless awareness,
you have got vibrations, but you have to jump

793
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,750
into Nirvikalpa.

794
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,750
Nirvikalpa.

795
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:08,339
And [to] that you have to jump through deep
meditation and through deep exposure.

796
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:13,160
Otherwise, you see, it is no use only having
this little state of Nirvichara, you have

797
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,160
to jump into Nirvikalpa.

798
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,160
That is a stage, little, as I’ve told you
here, that a little ahead of this reflector,

799
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
you have moved.

800
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,460
But still you are going up and down, so many
of you.

801
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:27,071
This is a state known as satori in the Zen
system of religion, they call it as satori:

802
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,460
where, you see, if a person is going up and
down, is catching, doing this, that.

803
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,089
This stage has to be overcome.

804
01:04:31,089 --> 01:04:34,120
Then you go to the Nirvikalpa state.

805
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,910
At the end of the Nirvikalpa state you just
don’t catch much.

806
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,370
You are not bothered.

807
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,930
So far, I haven’t met any human being like
that.

808
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:47,520
You see, I have seen very great saints and
realised people and I can say that they are

809
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,710
definitely Self-realised, they are even controlling
nature, some of them do, but still they catch

810
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:54,890
on their chakras, is something surprising.

811
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:59,810
But, you see, human beings are like that,
they’ll go on catching and again, perhaps,

812
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:04,080
they jump into the third state of Self-realisation
completely, but they are again in a satori

813
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,560
state and they come back and go back and,
like that, may be.

814
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,250
But I have seen that, so far, I have not met
one human being whom I will say he is fully

815
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,180
Self-realised, who doesn’t catch.

816
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:17,340
Except for me, I find, everybody is catching.

817
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,680
It’s most surprising.

818
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,580
But when you don’t catch – what happens,
when you don’t catch?

819
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,520
Actually, this is a state rather difficult
to achieve.

820
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:30,740
But if you don’t catch, if you think you
don’t catch – how you should do it ?- is

821
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:34,220
to see this way: that if, supposing, you are
catching Agya, maybe.

822
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:38,190
You must know that when you are catching your
Agya, you should not think you are catching

823
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:42,220
your Agya, but you should think that you are
gathering a force here to combat the another

824
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,220
person.

825
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,220
If you can do like that.

826
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,930
Supposing you are catching on the Vishuddhi
chakra, instead of thinking that you are catching

827
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:53,270
on Vishuddhi chakra and getting upset about
it, if you start thinking that this is a force

828
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:56,240
you are accumulating just to counterbalance
his Vishuddhi chakra.

829
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,220
Then, I think, it will work out better.

830
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,710
That’s why I always say that: extend your
hands to others and see for yourself.

831
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,359
This has helped many people because if they
catch on Agya and if they give vibrations

832
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,790
to somebody who is Agya caught, they find
they are released.

833
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,960
Such things are happening to very few but
it’s happening.

834
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,700
So, this is what you can try: that don’t
think you are catching but you should think:

835
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,890
a force has been accumulated to expel the
Agya of another person who is facing you.

836
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:23,340
In the beginning, of course, it’s a very,
very slow process, but gradually you can do

837
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,450
it and only people who start giving others.

838
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,330
This is a collective thinking, is a collective
thinking: that, supposing, now you can say

839
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:35,470
like that, that if, supposing, there is a
malaria attack on Me, then My own blood, My

840
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,190
own blood cells are trying to combat it.

841
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,230
And they are combating it.

842
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:42,359
You see, if I give in, if I give in, then
I become malarious.

843
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:44,180
But if I do not give in, I become victorious.

844
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:50,330
In the same way, if you could think this way
while giving vibrations: that if you catch

845
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:54,839
it is actually a force being accumulated into
you and then you have to give it, then you

846
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:58,250
are going to be much faster than all the munis
put together, I can tell you.

847
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,470
But that thinking is rather difficult for
human beings, because once they catch, they

848
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:04,260
get little worried, “I’m catching,”
they start taking out their own.

849
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,270
If you don’t take out your own and go all
out to give it to others, it will work out

850
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:09,270
better.

851
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,720
And this I’ve been, I’ve experimented
with one or two people, I’m saying, and

852
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,720
it has worked.

853
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,800
Everybody does not have that capacity.

854
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,950
So, gradually you rise, because you are just
now newly born children, you have still to

855
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:21,720
grow, you have to grow more.

856
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,030
You might be learned, you might be knowing
a lot, that doesn’t mean, as far as your

857
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,810
spirituality is concerned, you have just have
come out of your satori state, some of you,

858
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,980
and some of you are still in the satori state.

859
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,230
So, be careful about it.

860
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:36,170
I would like to meet you again, perhaps, after
two years, I don’t know when.

861
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,130
Tomorrow we are having a meditation here,
then I won’t speak much.

862
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,560
Tomorrow we have a meditation.

863
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,540
We have a meditation centre here, where you
should go and meet, when you meet in a group

864
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:51,410
then it is a samuhik, is a group activity,
I will be there.

865
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:57,130
You’ll be surprised that my vibrations cannot
be felt anywhere so much as they can be felt

866
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,490
in a group, about which I know that such and
such group is working here.

867
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,590
So, we have already three groups which are
working in Delhi.

868
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,710
And they are made quite closer to the places.

869
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:09,060
After all, we must know that we don’t have
to go to Himalayas, as people went down, we

870
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,190
don’t have to do all these things.

871
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:13,950
Only thing we have to go is to a place which
is very much closer to us, it has been brought

872
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,320
to our doors.

873
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:21,620
The whole thing has been brought to your doors:
the knowledge, the vibrations, the realisation

874
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,930
and everything is made so easy.

875
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:23,930
It’s made easy….

876
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,609
But it should not mean that we should take
it for granted.

877
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:31,339
It has been made easy through a very, very
great tapasya on my part, I should say.

878
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:35,089
In many ages I’ve been living now for thousands
of years and I’ve been working it out on

879
01:08:35,089 --> 01:08:40,190
so many human beings and so many things and,
at long last, I’ve been able to find out

880
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:43,830
most of the permutations and combinations
of most of the human beings and that’s how

881
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,359
it has been worked out in such a large mass-scale.

882
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:49,920
It would not have been possible if I had not
worked it out in that way.

883
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,210
And that’s how if it has worked out it has
to click with most of the people except for

884
01:08:54,210 --> 01:09:00,460
one type is very, very difficult, I must say,
those who are bound to people who are rakshasas.

885
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,819
If they are born rakshasas and if your head
has touched their feet, it’s a very difficult

886
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:04,819
thing.

887
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:06,989
So, I would warn you, that before you touch
feet of anybody, you’d be careful about

888
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:07,989
it.

889
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:08,989
May God bless you all!

890
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:13,270
It’s already very late for all of you and
such a difficult subject to be brought to

891
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:16,370
such a short time, it’s very difficult.

892
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:21,030
I hope to write some book on Sahaja Yoga:
‘I hope’, I am saying, because, so far,

893
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,109
I’ve never written any book.

894
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:24,950
[I’m] trying to write some book, but before
that some other people are writing.

895
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,920
I hope, I may be able to write something.

896
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,440
In any case, you try not to bother too much
about these things.

897
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,880
This is not so important as your own realisation
and your own ascent [because] the whole knowledge

898
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,029
will be dawned upon you.

899
01:09:37,029 --> 01:09:38,730
You don’t have to bother!

900
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:41,730
Every word now you read, you will have a meaning
about it and you will understand.

901
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:45,670
The first thing is that you must get your
realisation, second thing is you must ascend.

902
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,980
You must ascend much more and give more time
to this.

903
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:50,410
Do not take it for granted.

904
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,680
It is a very important thing which you should
do.

905
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,969
After all there are other things, they are
important.

906
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:57,820
But this is the most important thing which
has to be done.

907
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,480
By God’s grace, if it works out I’ll be
very happy.

908
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:07,060
As it is, I’m extremely happy because in
none of my lives I’ve been able to give

909
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,130
realisations to so many people.

910
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:11,460
So as it is, I am over-satisfied with Myself.

911
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:15,190
But as far as you are concerned, you should
not be satisfied, you should ask for more

912
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,940
and more and more and it will be granted.

913
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,690
Because you are the people who are on the
stage, you are created for this purpose.

914
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,340
One has to do it.

915
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,449
God has to do it.

916
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:29,489
If He does not do it, He cannot fulfil His
own desires.

917
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:31,340
And His Creation, He is not going to destroy.

918
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:31,469
May God bless you!
