1
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:25,520
now what we can do is to today what

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,099
should I tell you the practical side the

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,800
meditation all right let's see what his

4
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,489
meditation is what we have to do for a

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,489
meditation

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,600
the first thing we have got is the left

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:46,490
side is the money shot

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,660
is the power of your emotion all right

9
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:54,420
now emotions are connected with your

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,370
right side also rather say for example

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,590
if you are emotionally disturbed just

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,840
now we got disturbed

13
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:08,220
so our schwarz our breathing also

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:11,790
increased and we felt the whole body was

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,080
sort of reacting and the we were feeling

16
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,970
the reaction of the prana right side

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,360
also that it was trying to express

18
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,570
itself like we started the tears is the

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,210
water element and all that came in and

20
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:34,009
the whole emotion was so much boring out

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:36,930
and with that our prana was also

22
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:40,640
involved say for example if you're

23
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,590
frightened if you are frightened

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,890
it's alright if you are frightened too

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,690
much then what happens if you are

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,080
frightened then also you get your

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:56,670
breathing very fast in it so it is

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,650
connected yes coming them so it is

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,400
connected if you are frightened it is

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:09,600
connected with your prana in your

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:11,820
breathing and your whole system is

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,750
connected with your emotions physical

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:18,150
system if you cry too much or if you

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,400
weep too much or if you are a sad person

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,019
that shows on your face your wish you

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,810
teach a cross for sure but not only

37
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,340
another but also we should be then also

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,820
your agua

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,019
so all the chakras reflect the left side

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,420
in such a way that physical

41
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:40,860
manifestation is also so it proves that

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:45,720
both are very much connected so - we

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,110
have to somehow other resolve these two

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,220
sides within

45
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,990
the left and right side because if you

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,360
do not dissolve it you are left half way

47
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,670
here so you have to dissolve these two

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,430
things and to dissolve these what should

49
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:05,980
we do

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:08,190
what can we do in meditation can you

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,190
suggest

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:19,390
say we have got prana and mana now prana

53
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:21,580
represents the right side and the mana

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,790
Shakti is the left side all right

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:28,720
these two have to be dissolved layer

56
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:30,220
means dissolved now how do we do it to

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,110
dissolve these two things they are

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:38,010
connected with each other after

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,010
realization

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,300
so before meditation we give ourselves a

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,780
bad

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,850
all right beside is more recently at the

63
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,490
time supposing you are emotionally that

64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,430
time mister then you put your right to

65
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,320
the left if you are that time disturbed

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,880
on the left side

67
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,950
I mean disturbed in the sense that if

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,650
your left side is frozen then you raise

69
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,260
your left side I'll give you our self

70
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,340
for balance before meditation now let us

71
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,970
see this side is less first of all put

72
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,970
your hands like this

73
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:33,250
are you alright

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,250
waiting coolbreeze waiting

75
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,120
better

76
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:51,120
are you getting in this

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,060
No

78
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:10,490
something moving always coming now I'm

79
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:22,279
still cool freeze it then it's good

80
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:26,409
breeze in your hat powerfully so once

81
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:29,990
you have given yourself a balance then

82
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:35,300
the best thing is to pay attention to

83
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:40,309
your emotions to manage to watch them

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:44,059
you can enlighten your emotions by

85
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:48,009
thinking of your mother right

86
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:50,539
just enlightened yes she will falter for

87
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:55,809
whatever are the problems in the manner

88
00:05:50,539 --> 00:06:03,619
all right so once you get connected with

89
00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:08,139
those emotions and you start looking at

90
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:08,139
them in your meditation

91
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:18,500
you will see these emotions are rising

92
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:21,620
within you and if you try to put these

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,100
emotions on your mother as I said the

94
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,090
lotus feet of your mother they will

95
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:38,060
start also resolving those emotions and

96
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:41,140
they'll become sort of expanded expanses

97
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,210
you will extend that in such a way that

98
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,450
you will feel you are in control this

99
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,420
emotion in control of them and by that

100
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,790
controlling those emotions your emotions

101
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:57,610
which are expanded enlightened are

102
00:06:52,790 --> 00:07:03,950
powerful and these emotions when you

103
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:08,630
feel that way then the cause of those

104
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:10,910
emotions can be solved for example just

105
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,990
now you got emotionally stirred up

106
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:18,860
because I talked about say these

107
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:22,040
children naturally anybody would be now

108
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,710
when you are stirred up with that you

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,590
put that problem of those feelings that

110
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,510
are rising in you that those waves or

111
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:35,300
feelings that are coming at the lotus

112
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:38,570
feet of you so they get touched say by

113
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,750
that power you can say then these

114
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,720
emotions become enlightened and when

115
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:49,010
these emotions become enlightened they

116
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,770
have a power to solve the problem do you

117
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,500
see the path as if they have reached the

118
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:58,669
shore where they got the light and this

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,910
problem can resolve because now you are

120
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,300
not in an individual self you are in the

121
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,410
expanse you are in the summer stream and

122
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,850
because you have entered into that

123
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,919
position that's why you have got these

124
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,020
powers of entering to another person's

125
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,450
body to see the vibrations of another

126
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,620
person to raise the Kundalini

127
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,620
otherwise we put

128
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,030
so for you it is very easy to do it

129
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,640
because I am also sitting here in person

130
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,640
so easy to put these emotions just there

131
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,340
so that they get enlightened and your

132
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,460
wish is fulfilled because emotions are

133
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:41,460
not Reaper fishing

134
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:44,099
these are unfulfilled wishes now how

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,910
they do it otherwise it also this way

136
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:53,540
that you take up these emotions and put

137
00:08:47,910 --> 00:09:00,060
them so that is these emotions are

138
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:06,120
actually the left side as I said if the

139
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:09,720
desire so the desire is taken any desire

140
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,160
and is put in the product now how do you

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,950
put it on the planner that you control

142
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,220
your pride that's why they do pranayama

143
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:23,160
see like you sit down now

144
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,600
very comfortably now you have a desire

145
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,930
to put your attention to that attention

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:37,770
is very important see now this attention

147
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:41,640
is to be put on to the product so the

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,560
emotions are there and then bring those

149
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:49,650
emotions and put them into your

150
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:52,980
attention means they are now you are

151
00:09:49,650 --> 00:10:00,570
aware of them now what you do is to

152
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:05,930
watch your breathing see now try to

153
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,930
reduce your breathing it is it

154
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:17,769
in the sense that you have read out meat

155
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,769
for a while they will behave

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,310
for a long time when you breathe out so

157
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,950
in one minute

158
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:33,600
your breathing will be less than normal

159
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,790
all right try that breathe in now with

160
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,040
the emotion keep the attention on the

161
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,400
emotions you see so that the connection

162
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,400
is established

163
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,180
Oh

164
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,680
better see to Kundalini Rises

165
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,900
now when you are breathing to find that

166
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,190
there is a space in between which you

167
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:34,240
just leave it vacant

168
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:36,630
breathe in now leave it vacant now

169
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,630
breathe out

170
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,950
or leave it vacant

171
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,160
reading

172
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,160
to be there

173
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,010
then give it

174
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,880
keep outside obligate

175
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,769
now start breathing in such a way that

176
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:17,769
you stop your breathing

177
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:45,270
attention should be on the heart or

178
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,270
could be on the emotions

179
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,330
better

180
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:06,310
keep the breathing inside for a while

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,690
bring it out then outside for a while

182
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,770
then again then you'll find that for a

183
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,770
while you will not drink

184
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:29,100
you see you settle down the layer takes

185
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:35,829
place between your prana and Yoruba now

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:38,889
both the Shakti's becomes one now at

187
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:42,480
this stage when you are silent now you

188
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:42,480
think of arrangement

189
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,180
clock

190
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,720
just think of it is lust is no more than

191
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,560
so what is happening actually that this

192
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,390
layer the attention goes into the

193
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,390
intellects and enlightens the England

194
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,720
see the thought is not there try to find

195
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,180
your intellect within yourself now see

196
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,420
see where is my intellect try to fight

197
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,420
it

198
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:40,720
but there it's not working again try it

199
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:44,790
it is working but it has become this

200
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,790
emerged has become the collective now

201
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:13,150
enough did you follow that there's no

202
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:15,040
thought this exercise will give you this

203
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:18,510
thoughtless awareness establishment of

204
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,510
thoughtless action there is no fun

205
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:26,400
so the second lesson alright maybe
