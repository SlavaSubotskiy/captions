1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:14,055
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

2
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,932
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

3
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:26,419
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

4
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:36,705
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

5
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:40,867
As I have said, you all are gurus

6
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:47,942
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

7
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:52,406
but the main thing one should understand

8
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:08,090
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

9
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,994
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

10
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:16,305
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

11
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:27,348
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

12
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:33,761
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

13
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:38,991
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

14
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:47,990
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

15
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:55,175
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

16
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,879
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,999
we cannot assimilate it that well.

18
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:10,238
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

19
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:17,590
We have to realise that we have all come

20
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:24,933
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

21
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:29,351
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

22
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:35,810
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

23
00:02:36,011 --> 00:02:45,174
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

24
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:58,065
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

25
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:08,566
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

26
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,799
We want to grab things of others;

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,547
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

28
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:23,524
They first used to grab lands,

29
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:34,176
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

30
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,175
Then they were not satisfied with that,

31
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:47,295
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

32
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:53,590
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

33
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,635
still they would grab.

34
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:04,214
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

35
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:09,165
but it is there because of our inheritance.

36
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:16,179
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

37
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,302
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

38
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:26,023
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

39
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:34,453
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

40
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:42,719
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,790
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

42
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:56,402
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

43
00:04:56,603 --> 00:05:01,066
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

44
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:08,335
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

45
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:12,506
we lack in some talents than another
person,

46
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:17,614
and they try to overpower that person

47
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:22,511
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

48
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:30,025
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

49
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:37,896
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

50
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:44,595
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

51
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:52,172
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

52
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:57,600
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

53
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:07,221
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

54
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:12,922
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

55
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:18,013
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

56
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:25,889
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

57
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:37,499
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

58
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,498
very violent temper.

59
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,774
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

60
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,816
When you see something which you don’t
like,

61
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:56,562
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

62
00:06:56,762 --> 00:07:00,214
immediately you flare up.

63
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:08,452
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

64
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:14,014
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

65
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:18,728
they were using match into it, matchstick.

66
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:23,265
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

67
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:28,992
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

68
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:34,157
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

69
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:38,225
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

70
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:44,079
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

71
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,283
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

72
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:57,682
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

73
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:04,236
we should not try to oppress others.

74
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:08,526
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

75
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:16,455
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

76
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:25,138
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

77
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:34,753
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

78
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:41,705
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

79
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:47,340
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

80
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,547
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

81
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:54,781
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

82
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:59,802
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

83
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:02,721
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

84
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:07,898
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

85
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:12,622
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

86
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:16,749
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

87
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,630
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

88
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,375
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

89
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:28,276
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

90
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:32,701
not yet fully equipped to understand,

91
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:43,656
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

92
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:52,130
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

93
00:09:53,727 --> 00:10:02,177
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

94
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:06,137
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

95
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:15,574
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

96
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:20,077
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

97
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,085
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

98
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:32,702
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

99
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:38,509
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

100
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,648
We may be even snakes animals.

101
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:47,531
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

102
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,444
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

103
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:55,417
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

104
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:57,841
if there’s a snake within us.

105
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:04,943
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

106
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:09,629
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

107
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:18,688
Now, this is not a very good situation,

108
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:23,247
that we are still at the level of animals

109
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:27,031
and our inheritance is still working in us.

110
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:31,033
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

111
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:34,012
And for good guru, you have to have

112
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:43,197
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

113
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,062
After all,

114
00:11:56,738 --> 00:12:03,219
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

115
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,084
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

116
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:19,283
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

117
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:25,177
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

118
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,991
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

119
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:31,108
I tell you, it will improve.

120
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,069
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

121
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:43,753
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

122
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:47,916
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

123
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,578
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

124
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,178
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

125
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:58,172
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

126
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:04,431
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

127
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:08,741
 so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

128
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:13,300
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

129
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,955
I must say other gurus were not like that.

130
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:24,987
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

131
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:29,412
and they used to lose temper on people.

132
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:36,834
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

133
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,931
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

134
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:47,980
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

135
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:53,135
And one of them got lost in the money.”

136
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,372
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

137
00:13:55,572 --> 00:14:00,326
“And second one got lost in the women.”

138
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:06,578
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

139
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,251
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

140
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:14,657
and kindness, better get around them.”

141
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:20,929
So, the one who was lost…

142
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:28,665
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

143
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,839
So who are those sitting outside?

144
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,803
Open it fully. Of course!

145
00:15:07,624 --> 00:15:10,021
Good.

146
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:33,290
Let them move this side.

147
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,717
Now is better.]

148
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:58,524
So as a guru, you must conclude

149
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:03,206
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

150
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:11,332
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

151
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:16,629
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

152
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:20,537
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

153
00:16:20,738 --> 00:16:27,764
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

154
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:34,586
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

155
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,176
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

156
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:44,578
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

157
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,502
to achieve this state ...
(interruption)

158
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:53,399
(Or, if they have) got Realisation, then,

159
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,638
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

160
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,068
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

161
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:08,378
and how others have to achieve it.

162
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:21,265
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

163
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:31,957
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

164
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:36,892
give his family up, do this, do that.

165
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:40,320
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

166
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,127
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

167
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:52,963
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

168
00:17:53,164 --> 00:18:00,202
And the worse comes to worse,

169
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:07,114
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

170
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:11,559
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

171
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:14,578
what the another person has to say,

172
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,879
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

173
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:28,939
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

174
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,008
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

175
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:43,164
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

176
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:49,421
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

177
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,427
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

178
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:59,542
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

179
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:04,469
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

180
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,552
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

181
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:12,207
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

182
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:18,092
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

183
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:23,280
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

184
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:27,939
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

185
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:35,922
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

186
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:40,315
So not to hurt people is very important.

187
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:45,869
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

188
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:55,598
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

189
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,733
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

190
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:05,160
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

191
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:13,655
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

192
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:18,622
As you are, you got your Realisation.

193
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,866
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

194
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,364
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

195
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:30,258
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

196
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:37,933
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

197
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,327
You don’t have to pay for it.

198
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:44,273
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

199
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:49,820
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

200
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:55,398
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

201
00:20:55,598 --> 00:21:00,690
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

202
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:06,050
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

203
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:09,727
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

204
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,352
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

205
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,116
Why? Why do we do it?

206
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:22,352
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

207
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:27,651
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

208
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:32,491
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

209
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:41,061
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

210
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:44,397
Now you have become a greater human being

211
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,253
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

212
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:52,132
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

213
00:21:52,333 --> 00:22:00,491
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

214
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:07,038
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

215
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:14,737
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

216
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:22,869
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

217
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:28,358
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

218
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,843
But that too in a such a soft manner

219
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:40,383
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

220
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:51,701
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

221
00:22:51,902 --> 00:22:58,011
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

222
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:05,465
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

223
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,688
alright, doesn’t matter.

224
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,592
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

225
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:20,021
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

226
00:23:20,222 --> 00:23:27,042
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

227
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:31,495
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

228
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:37,959
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

229
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,978
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

230
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,971
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

231
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:54,457
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

232
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:58,215
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

233
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,359
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

234
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,102
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

235
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:12,633
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

236
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:17,283
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

237
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:22,710
or some big position, then what does he do?

238
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:27,640
You can’t challenge him any way.

239
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,889
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

240
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,880
because he is so identified with that.

241
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,988
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

242
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:54,624
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

243
00:24:54,825 --> 00:25:05,853
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

244
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:16,020
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

245
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:21,709
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

246
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:28,155
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

247
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:34,801
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

248
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:41,579
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

249
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:48,614
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

250
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:57,327
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

251
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,951
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

252
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:07,419
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

253
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,644
it will never work out. So you must
understand

254
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:20,573
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

255
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:26,293
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

256
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:30,055
Not by argument, not by saying things,

257
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:39,285
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

258
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:45,601
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

259
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:50,657
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

260
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,837
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

261
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:58,612
and thirdly that he values love.

262
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:04,934
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

263
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:14,332
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

264
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:19,562
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

265
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:27,135
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

266
00:27:27,336 --> 00:27:32,644
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

267
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:37,345
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

268
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:44,307
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

269
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:48,166
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:54,217
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

271
00:27:54,417 --> 00:28:04,857
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

272
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:18,404
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

273
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:22,932
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

274
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:27,567
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

275
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:30,806
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

276
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:34,163
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

277
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:39,690
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

278
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:43,798
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

279
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:49,020
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

280
00:28:49,221 --> 00:28:53,314
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

281
00:28:53,515 --> 00:29:02,174
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

282
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:07,089
You put attention, but not attachment.

283
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:11,019
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

284
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,721
What solves the problem is attention.

285
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:22,551
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

286
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:28,927
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

287
00:29:29,128 --> 00:29:32,825
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

288
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:39,303
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

289
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:47,033
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

290
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:51,119
paying attention to that person.

291
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:54,728
And then your attention will work.

292
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:58,363
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

293
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:04,008
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

294
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:08,118
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

295
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:11,131
because you are attached to that person,

296
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:16,613
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

297
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:25,069
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

298
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,906
then your attention doesn’t work out.

299
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:33,498
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

300
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,864
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

301
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:39,824
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

302
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:43,865
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

303
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:50,833
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

304
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:56,274
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

305
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:59,454
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

306
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:01,731
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

307
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:08,130
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

308
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:13,789
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

309
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:20,219
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

310
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:27,756
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

311
00:31:27,957 --> 00:31:31,765
Attention should be absolutely free,

312
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:38,656
so it works automatically, automatically.

313
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:43,509
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

314
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,617
the attention will work it (out).

315
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:52,262
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

316
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:56,804
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

317
00:31:57,004 --> 00:32:01,432
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

318
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:06,173
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

319
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:11,579
but something higher, where your attention
works,

320
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,052
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

321
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:20,534
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

322
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:24,368
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

323
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:30,387
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

324
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:38,152
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

325
00:32:44,677 --> 00:32:54,435
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

326
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:57,983
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

327
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:06,814
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

328
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:10,580
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

329
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:14,334
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

330
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,567
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

331
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:25,046
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

332
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:30,819
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

333
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:37,091
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

334
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:42,472
You have to notice: What are they doing?

335
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:50,181
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

336
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:55,895
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

337
00:33:56,096 --> 00:34:02,509
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

338
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:07,675
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

339
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,200
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

340
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:20,703
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

341
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:25,952
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

342
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:29,171
It’s just an explanation.

343
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:34,199
But if you really don’t fix your attention

344
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,674
to one person or ten persons only,

345
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:43,828
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

346
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:54,439
It receives all the information and also
it gives

347
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,842
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

348
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:06,897
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

349
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:11,906
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

350
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:19,381
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

351
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:24,703
and in that you are not involved.

352
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:29,142
You see the situation and you are away 
from it.

353
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:33,572
Then you can solve that problem better.

354
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:41,269
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

355
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:48,265
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

356
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:53,320
cannot solve the problem.

357
00:35:53,521 --> 00:36:01,111
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

358
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:11,389
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

359
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:22,804
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

360
00:36:24,537 --> 00:36:28,223
So our attention has to be always free

361
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:33,871
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

362
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:39,772
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

363
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:45,508
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

364
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:53,026
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

365
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:58,486
Through introspection you will understand

366
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:05,274
that you need help to solve your problems.

367
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:11,377
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

368
00:37:11,578 --> 00:37:18,984
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

369
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:30,297
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

370
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:42,645
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

371
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:46,747
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

372
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:52,135
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

373
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:58,102
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

374
00:37:58,303 --> 00:38:01,827
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

375
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:06,325
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

376
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:10,901
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

377
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:15,709
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

378
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,220
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

379
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:25,708
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

380
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:33,012
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

381
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:40,767
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

382
00:38:40,968 --> 00:38:43,567
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

383
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:47,725
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

384
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:52,411
today we have a very complex society.

385
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:56,388
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

386
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:01,748
in which only thinking is responsible.

387
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:04,873
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

388
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:09,641
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

389
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:15,150
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

390
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:22,328
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

391
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:34,887
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

392
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:39,327
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

393
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:46,228
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

394
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:51,331
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

395
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:58,143
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

396
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:02,503
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

397
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:07,101
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

398
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:11,953
So there was only one building ahead,

399
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:19,751
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

400
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:23,525
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

401
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:29,682
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

402
00:40:29,883 --> 00:40:34,692
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

403
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,409
I was amazed how it is there.

404
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:41,078
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

405
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:44,118
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

406
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,431
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

407
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:53,707
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

408
00:40:53,908 --> 00:41:00,837
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

409
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,583
How, you see, things can be improved,

410
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:20,452
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

411
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:26,471
But love is truth and truth is love.

412
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:32,656
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

413
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:40,324
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

414
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:44,414
because it will be truthful.

415
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:49,981
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

416
00:41:50,182 --> 00:41:54,341
because it is absolutely truthful.

417
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:57,702
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

418
00:41:57,903 --> 00:42:01,199
you should be extremely truthful.

419
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,026
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

420
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:11,086
but you must use such ways and methods

421
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:16,204
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

422
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:20,484
which will have an effect on that person.

423
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:26,059
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

424
00:42:26,259 --> 00:42:29,461
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

425
00:42:29,662 --> 00:42:36,808
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

426
00:42:37,017 --> 00:42:41,515
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

427
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:49,182
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

428
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,885
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

429
00:42:56,086 --> 00:43:03,848
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

430
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:12,699
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

431
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,446
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

432
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:21,975
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

433
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:27,319
very easily, anything that you want to do.

434
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,335
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

435
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:40,642
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

436
00:43:40,843 --> 00:43:45,268
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

437
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:49,016
very important position that they are
gurus.

438
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:55,041
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

439
00:43:55,242 --> 00:43:58,934
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

440
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:07,034
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

441
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:09,413
People should not doubt him,

442
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,947
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

443
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:21,278
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

444
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:27,361
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

445
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:34,357
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

446
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:37,822
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

447
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:42,541
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

448
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:45,385
I tell you – very lots of people.

449
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:48,947
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

450
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:52,342
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

451
00:44:52,542 --> 00:44:58,438
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

452
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:11,501
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

453
00:45:11,664 --> 00:45:18,581
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

454
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:22,140
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

455
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:25,161
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

456
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:28,736
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

457
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:34,861
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

458
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:39,632
They all warned Me. So I came here

459
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,293
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

460
00:45:42,494 --> 00:45:45,590
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

461
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:51,362
He was surprised, how can I do that.

462
00:45:51,563 --> 00:45:57,938
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

463
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:04,102
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

464
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:10,673
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

465
00:46:10,874 --> 00:46:15,270
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

466
00:46:15,471 --> 00:46:21,351
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

467
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:29,529
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

468
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:37,719
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

469
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:43,737
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

470
00:46:43,938 --> 00:46:48,872
your particular ideas about particular
things,

471
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:55,093
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

472
00:46:56,075 --> 00:47:00,523
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

473
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:04,119
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

474
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:10,928
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

475
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:17,028
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

476
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:23,460
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

477
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:28,103
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

478
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:35,819
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

479
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:42,217
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

480
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:46,390
It emits and creates a path for you,

481
00:47:46,591 --> 00:47:51,152
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

482
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:55,660
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

483
00:47:55,861 --> 00:48:00,639
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

484
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:05,268
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

485
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:12,865
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

486
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:16,281
May God bless you all.

487
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:35,391
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

488
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:39,465
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

489
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,055
which is also a human quality.

490
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:47,259
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

491
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,672
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

492
00:48:52,873 --> 00:48:57,381
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

493
00:48:57,582 --> 00:49:00,933
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

494
00:49:01,134 --> 00:49:07,948
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

495
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:11,878
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

496
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,436
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

497
00:49:14,637 --> 00:49:18,395
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

498
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:23,226
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

499
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:27,479
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

500
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,300
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

501
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,324
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

502
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:40,465
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

503
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:46,978
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

504
00:49:47,178 --> 00:49:52,097
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

505
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:54,560
and she has done something very wrong,

506
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,740
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

507
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:00,461
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

508
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:11,665
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

509
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:19,529
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

510
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:24,625
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

511
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:29,034
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

512
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:33,448
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

513
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:39,208
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

514
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:43,299
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

515
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:50,827
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

516
00:50:51,037 --> 00:50:54,402
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

517
00:50:54,582 --> 00:50:59,169
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

518
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:05,418
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

519
00:51:05,618 --> 00:51:11,873
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

520
00:51:12,074 --> 00:51:15,119
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

521
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,485
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

522
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:22,614
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

523
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,792
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

524
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:30,560
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

525
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:37,229
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

526
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:41,931
So thank you very much again and again.

527
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,975
May God bless you.

528
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,326
May God bless you all.
