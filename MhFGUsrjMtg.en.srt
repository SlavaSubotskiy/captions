1
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:12,838
Since we have come to Cabella, 
it is the ten years completed.

2
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:25,840
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,
we have been able to progress in Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:35,257
Now, today we are going to have a Guru Puja.

4
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:45,288
As I have said, you all are gurus and you
want to worship Me as your Guru.

5
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:47,294
It is all right.

6
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:52,285
But the main thing one should understand,

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:03,478
that you have become guru, no doubt,

8
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,930
because you have the knowledge,
 you have the absolute knowledge.

9
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:16,261
And so we can say you have become gurus, no doubt.

10
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:26,500
But one has to understand that you have reached a state

11
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,459
 where you can raise the Kundalini,

12
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:32,995
you can give Realization to others.

13
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:37,873
Also you know what is the absolute knowledge.

14
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:46,696
To know the absolute knowledge is very important,

15
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:54,125
and to assimilate is even much more important.

16
00:01:56,051 --> 00:02:01,541
Though we know the absolute knowledge, we
cannot assimilate it that well.

17
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:05,115
That means we cannot go deep into it.

18
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,205
What is the reason for that?

19
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:23,491
We have to realize that we have all come out
of the heritage that was the animal kingdom.

20
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:28,364
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

21
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:38,148
So there are so many things of the animal
heritage that linger in us:

22
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:57,785
the aggressiveness, the domination,
 peevishness, fear, grabbing.

23
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:08,407
All these are our inheritance, and they are
within us lingering.

24
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:15,207
We want to grab things of others’ - not
you people, of course not,

25
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:19,200
but people who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:33,316
They first used to grab lands, then they started 
grabbing people, making them slaves.

27
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,213
Then they were not satisfied with that,

28
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:46,621
 so they were grabbing kingdoms,
 jewelry and all these things.

29
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,344
So just to grab.

30
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:55,597
They have no legal right, still they would grab.

31
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:03,993
It seems, it seems very funny,
 it seems very inhuman,

32
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:08,629
but it is there because of our inheritance.

33
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:15,423
Now there are so many other things, like jealousy.

34
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:19,873
Among animals there is very little of that,

35
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,714
they don't have jealousies so much as we have;

36
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:33,866
while we have inherited this jealousy by our
own reactions and thinking.

37
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:42,449
People get jealous and they want to put down
others.

38
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:50,161
If they cannot achieve any height, they want
to bring down the heights of others.

39
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:56,114
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human beings,

40
00:04:56,495 --> 00:05:00,598
 they think whatever is done in the
 name of jealousy is all right.

41
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:08,066
They become very conscious that “We are
lower than another person.

42
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:17,021
We lack in some talents than another person,”
and they try to overpower that person,

43
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:22,211
 because of the force of jealousy behind them.

44
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:30,050
Now the trouble is, though we are human beings,

45
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:37,881
we have inherited so many animal qualities,
 like we are ferocious,

46
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:44,568
we are angry and we get upset, as animals do.

47
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:54,120
But additional to that, human beings can react
because of their thinking.

48
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,008
They think.

49
00:05:56,033 --> 00:06:05,977
They can think, and by thinking, all these
inherited properties become perverted.

50
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,344
Like a person wants to put down another person.

51
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:18,034
Then he doesn’t behave like an animal, in
a straightforward way,

52
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:26,143
but he will find out a device, a method, 
he’ll think it over how to do it.

53
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:34,832
The main problem with human beings is that

54
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,911
they still have inherited very violent temper.

55
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:48,541
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

56
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,928
When you see something which you don't like,

57
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:56,558
which is against your will,
 it may be something like that,

58
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,685
 immediately you flare up.

59
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:07,387
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor, they
had put a sugar candy.

60
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:12,523
To sugar candy they were putting

61
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:18,766
the matchbox, you see, 
they were using a match into it, matchstick.

62
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:20,920
It would not take the fire.

63
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:23,321
They tried and tried, it would not.

64
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:26,125
So I said, "Let Me see what is that."

65
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,806
So that was a sugar candy.

66
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:33,896
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

67
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:38,056
So the quality of the person is known in the
same way.

68
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,601
If with the slightest provocation, 
if he gets into temper

69
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:49,089
and gets annoyed, then his quality is not very good as a guru.

70
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:57,685
As a guru we should not flare up, 
we should not get angry,

71
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:02,969
we should not try to oppressothers.

72
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,210
"But what can we do, then?"
people will ask.

73
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:14,138
We have another method, what we call is love.

74
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:15,895
Love.

75
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:24,136
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person,

76
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:34,731
 so what happens that it doesn’t give you any anger,

77
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:38,662
and the another person, you don't make him angry also.

78
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,411
Anger begets anger.

79
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:47,452
If you get angry with somebody,
 that person may not retort

80
00:08:47,477 --> 00:08:50,642
because he is afraid of you, it may be that;

81
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,671
 but in his heart he will keep a revenge in his mind

82
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,990
that “One day I will show him.

83
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,740
Why should he get angry with me?”

84
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:07,630
So in Sahaja Yoga, please remember that love
is the only way we can solve the problem.

85
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:12,502
Now if something goes wrong, say, in the ashram,

86
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:16,511
if you get angry with that person, what will happen?

87
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:20,550
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

88
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:25,895
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he may realize
that it was a wrong thing to do.

89
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:32,426
But if he’s a bad Sahaja Yogi, not yet fully
equipped to understand,

90
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,181
then what he will do?

91
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:43,376
He will just feel that “This man has insulted
me.

92
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:51,850
He has deliberately put me down and all that,
and I should try to take a revenge.”

93
00:09:53,647 --> 00:10:01,016
Among animals this activity is very limited.

94
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:06,275
I don't think they believe in revenge, except
for a few animals.

95
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,131
They say that if you hurt a snake,

96
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:19,741
it will take its respite, it will come back on you, 
that's what is said.

97
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:26,023
And this one is something, one quality of
the snake.

98
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:32,719
But as we have passed through 
all these different categories,

99
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:38,557
we might be having some of the qualities
 of some of these animals within us,

100
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,421
we may be even snakes anywhere.

101
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:49,795
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you, you’ll remember it all your life.

102
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,206
“He has hurt me, so I’ll put him right
one day, I’ll take a revenge!”

103
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,586
If there’s a snake within us.

104
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:04,726
But now if there's a tiger within you, so
you’ll become very ferocious,

105
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:08,680
 at the smallest thing you'll get angry, lose temper.

106
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:18,558
Now, this is not a very good situation,

107
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:23,161
that we are still at the level of animals

108
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:26,856
and our inheritance is still working in us.

109
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,585
So we have to keep a watch.

110
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,480
We have to be good gurus, and for a good guru, 
you have to have a very

111
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:42,963
peaceful, compassionate, loving temperament.

112
00:11:43,265 --> 00:12:02,285
After all, one has to understand that people
have this inheritance,

113
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:08,404
and some people have more, or some people 
have this, or some people have that.

114
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:15,339
For that, if you get angry with that person,

115
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:19,363
it’s not going to help him or help you.

116
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:23,482
But if you are loving and compassionate and you explain

117
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:28,753
that person what is the problem is and what you want to do,

118
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:32,805
 I tell you it will improve, he’ll definitely improve

119
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,771
and he’ll feel your love.

120
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:43,556
Of course sometimes, sometimes it’s necessary
to also forgive such a person.

121
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:47,661
Such a person is to be forgiven, absolutely.

122
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:53,298
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs, all kinds of wrongs,

123
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:57,941
you forgive him and he goes on still 
with the same, doesn't mean that.

124
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,988
“Forgiven” means “forgotten.”

125
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:04,526
Such and such person has been misbehaving,

126
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:08,734
so just forget, forget it, completely forget it.

127
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:12,643
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja Yogi
guru.

128
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,914
I must say others gurus were not like that,

129
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:24,441
 they were absolutely, I would say, extremely hot-tempered,

130
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:29,225
 and they used to lose temper
on people.

131
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:36,228
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them.

132
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,494
And with this kindness You cannot create good
people.

133
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:43,558
I’ve had enough of it,” he said.

134
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,683
“I had made two people into gurus,

135
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:52,937
and one of them got lost in the money.”

136
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,467
“All right, what happened to the second?”

137
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:59,622
“And second one got lost in the women.”

138
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:04,651
So I said, ”Now it's all right.

139
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:10,346
If they are lost, they are lost, but if you
can revive them with your love, affection

140
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:14,471
and kindness, better get around them.”

141
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:21,460
So the one who was lost…

142
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:28,755
I think if you open that door 
people  sitting outside can also hear me.

143
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,880
Who are those sitting outside?

144
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:42,406
Open it fully, of course.

145
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,573
Let them move this side

146
00:15:55,206 --> 00:16:02,678
So as a guru, you must conclude that they
are still lingering with their inheritance.

147
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:10,347
But the second problem is much worse, because
human beings can think.

148
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:16,685
Of course animals also think, but it is always
conditioning.

149
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:20,632
Whatever conditioning they have, accordingly
they behave.

150
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:27,175
But they don't have ego, that kind as human
beings have developed.

151
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:33,083
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

152
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:42,212
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that “We have done so much,

153
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:45,910
we have worked so hard to achieve this state,

154
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:54,734
.... have got Realization, then, “What have they done?

155
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:56,865
Why should they get Realization?”

156
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,163
It’s become a comparison between their own
state and how they have achieved it,

157
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:08,023
and how others have to achieve it.

158
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:20,746
So they make all kinds of different torturing,
troubling maneuvres.

159
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:28,759
For example, they may make the disciple

160
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:36,652
stand on his head, give his family up, do this, do that.

161
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:40,258
They’ll beat them, they can beat also.

162
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:49,677
They will make him stay in the water for a
long time, make him stand under, on one feet.

163
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:59,500
Like this they punish, and the worst comes to worst,

164
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:04,614
they may beat with sticks or with stones.

165
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:07,147
They’re like that.

166
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:14,302
They don't want to talk, they don't want to
understand what the another person has to say,

167
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:20,228
 or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

168
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:28,698
All this anger and all these things might
have been all right before,

169
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:33,932
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga 
you must know it is not necessary.

170
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:42,144
It is not at all necessary to give any physical
punishment to your disciples.

171
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:48,815
Now also the mental punishment to your disciple
should not be given.

172
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:54,529
Like people start saying all kinds of things to their disciple;

173
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,426
like saying they, I am saying, say there is a leader,

174
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:04,456
 and the leader finds something wrong with the disciple,

175
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,359
 then he goes on saying, “Now you are like this,
your father was like this,

176
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:14,362
your grandfather was like this, your great- 
grandfather was like this, and you are also like this.”

177
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,890
Or some sort of thing that will hurt him.

178
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,678
By hurting a person, you are not going to help.

179
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:27,766
Supposing while walking you are hurt, you
can't walk.

180
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:35,696
In your spiritual ascent also if you are hurt,
you cannot go ahead.

181
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,953
So not to hurt people is very important.

182
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:45,884
Once you go on hurting others, 
then you are not a good guru,

183
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:54,272
you are not a one who is really being kind 
and understanding of the disciple.

184
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,767
In Sahaja Yoga it's a different thing altogether,

185
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,255
because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga 
without doing any kind of penance,

186
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,672
 any kind of a guilty consciousness, confessions, anything.

187
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:11,997
Nothing!

188
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:17,316
As you are, you got your Realization.

189
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:26,460
Nobody had to stand on their heads, give up their husbands, 
wives, their families, this thing - nothing of the kind.

190
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:30,227
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

191
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:36,484
whatever conditions you are, 
you are given Realization - it’s a fact.

192
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:44,368
You don't have to pay for it, you don't have
to exert yourself, don't have to do anything.

193
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:50,033
Just you get it, sitting down wherever you
are.

194
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:55,493
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

195
00:20:55,518 --> 00:21:00,763
that you have a power of love, of compassion.

196
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,001
Out of your love you have given Realization.

197
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:05,873
We never realize that.

198
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:09,822
Supposing we are anxious 
to give Realization to people,

199
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:14,381
we want to go to the villages, work there 
and give them Realization.

200
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,167
Why?

201
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,036
Why do we do it?

202
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:22,447
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

203
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:27,120
but just out of the love that is within your heart

204
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,637
that you feel,  “Why am I enjoying everything?

205
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:32,234
Why others are not enjoying?”

206
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:40,761
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realization.

207
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:46,480
Now you have become a greater human being,
and you feel concern.

208
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:52,187
Others are getting ruined, they are going
on the wrong path, they are doing wrong things;

209
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:59,887
and that makes you feel very, very upset,
and you want to help them.

210
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:08,908
And this understanding once you have, then
you will know how to deal with the person

211
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:13,739
with whom you have to behave like a guru.

212
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:21,335
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

213
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,326
At the most you can tell the mistakes 
that they have committed,

214
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:40,431
but that too in a, such a soft manner 
that a person doesn’t get any shock out of that.

215
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:48,101
All this thing of attachments also:

216
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:53,282
now somebody
has too much attachment, say, for the family,

217
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:57,337
for the wife, for the children or someone.

218
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:05,412
And once they come to Sahaj Yoga, still they
have same amount of attachment.

219
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:07,889
All right, doesn’t matter.

220
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:15,967
But how far they will go with that attachment,
how long it will continue is the point.

221
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:19,482
You should be detached.

222
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:26,986
If I say, you cannot be; it's a state, it's
a state of mind when you are detached.

223
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:34,102
But when it comes to doing something for them,
you will go all out to help them.

224
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:38,054
But you are not a attached person.

225
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,703
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

226
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:50,862
Attached person is always worried about the
other person, goes on thinking about the other person,

227
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:57,852
 cannot think of Sahaja Yoga, only
think of the people with whom he is attached.

228
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:01,454
Then he is very sensitive, you can't say anything

229
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:06,197
 to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise he jumps.

230
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:12,395
Attachment is also with the name that he has.

231
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:16,568
Supposing he has achieved a certain name, supposing,

232
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:22,700
or some big position, then what does he do?

233
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:31,697
You can't challenge him any way, you cannot
by any words you can challenge him, because

234
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,975
he’s so identified with that.

235
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,180
He thinks he’s a big person who has achieved
such a lot of positions in life.

236
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:53,506
He’s so much attached that he wants also
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

237
00:24:54,712 --> 00:25:05,084
Now which is the way you can solve that problem?

238
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:14,877
Supposing somebody is very much attached
 to his wife, say for example,

239
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:21,546
then you should not discuss and argue with that person, not at all,

240
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:27,419
because he’s still coming up slowly, slowly up to this stage.

241
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:34,540
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect Sahaja Yogi.

242
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:37,069
So what do you have to do?

243
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:40,595
If he’s attached to his wife, let it be.

244
00:25:42,873 --> 00:25:51,923
But the Divine will work it out, and he will
realize that what he has been thinking, doing

245
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:56,389
and taking decisions is all wrong.

246
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:03,046
And once he discovered it himself,
 then he will get detached.

247
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:09,532
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out, it will never work out.

248
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:16,230
So you must understand that as human beings,
whatever we were,

249
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:19,842
also as Sahaja Yogis, we have problems.

250
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:25,855
And these should be slowly, slowly should
be dissolved;

251
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:32,361
not by argument, not by saying things, 
but by love and compassion.

252
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:44,252
If you have love for a person, you will be
amazed, ninety-nine percent people value love.

253
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,579
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

254
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:58,282
First is his inheritance, second is, he thinks,
and thirdly that he values love.

255
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:04,451
Anybody who loves, the another person values
that love,

256
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:13,010
because he thinks that “This particular person is loving me;

257
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:19,388
 not my wealth, not my beauty, 
not my this thing, but he is loving me.”

258
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:26,409
And this idea of love, 
this is something that will get him

259
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:32,739
completely detached  from that person, easily.
How?

260
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:39,284
Now it looks very funny that if you like somebody,
if you love somebody,

261
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:43,002
and then you should get detached.

262
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:47,301
It’s only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

263
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:54,162
In Sahaja Yoga your state of mind is such

264
00:27:54,337 --> 00:28:02,248
that you are absolutely detached 
and absolutely attached.

265
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,416
How?

266
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:13,670
For example now, say I have My daughter,

267
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:20,637
so I’m detached, I never telephone to her,

268
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:27,528
I am never bothered about her; because in
Sahaja Yoga, you know how is that person.

269
00:28:27,687 --> 00:28:30,872
If the vibrations are right, why should you
telephone?

270
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:32,732
Why should you talk to her?

271
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:35,226
Why should you ask for anything?
No need.

272
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:39,601
Only on vibrations you'll know how the person
is.

273
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,743
And so it will seem that you are absolutely detached.

274
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:49,021
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

275
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:53,372
or are indicating something serious about that person,

276
00:28:53,397 --> 00:29:01,745
what you will do, you'll put full attention to that, full attention.

277
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:06,524
You put attention, but not attachment.

278
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:10,926
So the attachment doesn’t solve the problem.

279
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,442
What solves the problem is attention.

280
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:21,810
But when you are not detached, then your attention
is attached attention.

281
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:31,717
It's an attention that is not available to
everyone, an attention that gets stuck,

282
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:37,277
absolutely stuck into that person with whom you are identified.

283
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,264
Try to understand.

284
00:29:39,423 --> 00:29:45,462
So to be identified with someone is not actually,

285
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:49,740
what we can say, paying attention to that person.

286
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:54,628
And then your attention will work.

287
00:29:54,763 --> 00:30:01,922
If you are of that level, whenever you put attention to 
that particular person who needs your attention,

288
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,311
it will work.

289
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:10,289
But if you are all the time wasting your attention
on a person because you’re attached to that person,

290
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:16,167
your attention will be tired, it won't
work out.

291
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:24,755
It's a big, I should say, a paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

292
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:28,340
then your attention doesn’t work.

293
00:30:28,974 --> 00:30:31,648
And if you are not attached to that person…

294
00:30:31,673 --> 00:30:33,593
You do everything else:

295
00:30:33,618 --> 00:30:35,959
now you have to give lecture, 
all right, I’m giving lecture;

296
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:39,858
then I have to do some cooking, I'll do cooking;
this, that, that and that.

297
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,826
But all the time if you are thinking about that person,

298
00:30:43,985 --> 00:30:47,834
all the time you want to have connection with that person -

299
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,522
 it’s not necessary.

300
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:53,016
That person is all right.

301
00:30:53,321 --> 00:30:56,369
What is there to be so much worried about
that person?

302
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:59,549
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

303
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,812
you have to raise Kundalini of so many.

304
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:07,969
Now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, it's not a very good thing.

305
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:16,103
By that kind of attachment your attention
also becomes useless, absolutely useless.

306
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:20,030
So let the attention be free.

307
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:27,181
Attention should not be bound by your attachments.

308
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:36,231
Attention should be absolutely free, so it
works automatically,

309
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:45,577
automatically, and you will be amazed, even
 if you do not pay attention, the attention will work it.

310
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:54,851
It is such a big thing to have this spiritual
attention, which is nothing but love.

311
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:56,848
It will just act.

312
00:31:56,924 --> 00:32:00,452
You'll be amazed how it acts.

313
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:08,169
It's another world I am talking about, not
this mundane world but something higher,

314
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:15,681
where your attention works, and works so beautifully
that you are amazed how it has worked.

315
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:20,340
But you should not bound it by your attachments.

316
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,464
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere,

317
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:29,099
only the people who are attached to you, 
or you are attached to those persons.

318
00:32:30,727 --> 00:32:37,717
That's why identification is not the way a
guru should work it out.

319
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:53,330
Now there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

320
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:59,453
He thinks this is he is the best, and he should
be encouraged and he should be given

321
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,117
 all the possible help.

322
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,156
But that’s not going to help.

323
00:33:06,815 --> 00:33:10,582
But on the contrary, he should say, “This
is already a good fellow.

324
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:14,370
He has risen already very high, he has gone
very deep.”

325
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:18,306
So pay attention to those who are not so good,

326
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:24,922
and talk to them about it that 
“You have to come up,” in a very sweet manner.

327
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:32,543
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there, or who are still struggling.

328
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:36,763
You have to understand them.

329
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:42,525
You have to notice, what are they doing?

330
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:50,054
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

331
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:55,816
What is the problem, why the Divine is not
flowing through them?

332
00:33:56,092 --> 00:34:02,513
And you'll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention,

333
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:06,084
 is because it is focused on someone all the time.

334
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,912
They feel that this is their responsibility,
that it should be focused.

335
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:20,666
It's just to give, it's an explanation, it's
just a explanation to say that

336
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:25,851
 “You see, naturally I have to be worried about this,
and worried about that.”

337
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,969
It's just an explanation.

338
00:34:29,252 --> 00:34:37,540
But if you really don't fix your attention
to one person or ten persons only,

339
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:43,292
 then your attention looks after the whole world.

340
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:54,440
It receives all the information, and also it gives

341
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,325
all the information what is to be done to correct the situation.

342
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:04,830
So one has to rise into that state

343
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:11,567
where you do not get angry, annoyed, upset - no, not at all.

344
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:23,067
What happens to you, that you see a situation,
and in that you are not involved.

345
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:28,877
You see the situation and you are away from
it.

346
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:33,039
Then you can solve that problem better.

347
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:39,353
But if you are part and parcel of that problem,
then you cannot solve.

348
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:52,230
It's like this I was telling, that those who
are fighting, say, cannot solve the problem,

349
00:35:53,512 --> 00:36:00,582
but a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

350
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:13,620
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that if you are identified, if you are involved

351
00:36:13,645 --> 00:36:21,717
with one person or with one kind of a thing,
then you are lost.

352
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:33,766
So our attention has to be always free and
can be applied widely, wherever needed.

353
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,542
That is the state one has to reach.

354
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:43,092
If you reach that state of mind, it's not
I am saying you can do anything about it,

355
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:44,972
it’s just a state of mind.

356
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,601
Now, how do we do that?

357
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,748
Only through introspection.

358
00:36:54,667 --> 00:37:04,410
Through introspection you will understand
that you need help to solve your problems.

359
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:11,120
Firstly the problem is how to face yourself,

360
00:37:11,485 --> 00:37:17,237
because you are a little bit shy or maybe nervous about it.

361
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:28,897
As the time comes, you'd be amazed that this
nervousness has no meaning at all.

362
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:39,079
When you try to be deliberate about it,

363
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:45,578
then it won't work out;
but if you are Sahaja, it will work out.

364
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:51,998
So we come to the second point, apart from
the attention,

365
00:37:52,196 --> 00:37:57,874
 that we should leave everything into the hands of Paramchaitanya.

366
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:00,866
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

367
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,547
“This is the problem?

368
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,209
Let Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

369
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:08,075
We are not bothered.”

370
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,697
So a detachment comes in.

371
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:15,299
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve,

372
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,965
so you are not in it, you are away from it.

373
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:27,090
Very, very simple things are there, that if
you understand that

374
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:32,838
we suffer, because everybody feels responsible for us.

375
00:38:33,107 --> 00:38:40,621
Everybody thinks they are responsible, they have to do
 this responsibility for us, somebody says

376
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,536
this responsibility he has to do.

377
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:48,924
All these things are worrying them, and that
is the reason today

378
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,214
we have a very complex society.

379
00:38:52,532 --> 00:39:00,873
They are suffering from all kinds of diseases
in which only thinking is responsible.

380
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:06,770
By this thinking all the time, thinking about
one person, thinking about one problem,

381
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,023
you reach nowhere.

382
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:14,795
At that moment, what you have to do is to
leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

383
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:21,631
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will manage,

384
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:30,385
It will solve the problem.

385
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:34,192
Now I will tell you one thing, an experience.

386
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,943
This time I was in America.

387
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:39,182
I wanted to have a puja there.

388
00:39:39,448 --> 00:39:42,372
So I said, "All right, let them come for the
puja.

389
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,323
It's nice if they want to come."

390
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:50,987
Then they told Me that "Mother, we want to
bring presents for You for the puja.

391
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:53,848
So how can we bring the presents?"

392
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:56,327
I said, "It's very simple.

393
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,153
Don't bring!"

394
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:00,773
But they wouldn't listen to that.

395
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:06,401
They said, "We'll have to bring, and the Customs
will trouble us and do this and do that."

396
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:13,767
So there was only one building ahead was,
there was another

397
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:19,081
building where they were having a liquidation sale.

398
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:21,402
I said, "This is something nice!

399
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:23,372
One can have a look at it."

400
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:28,195
So I went in and I found things so cheap,

401
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:34,127
unbelievable, very, very expensive things 
for throw-away prices.

402
00:40:34,813 --> 00:40:37,426
I was amazed how it is there.

403
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:41,206
So I told them, "I can purchase all these
things. I'll pay you,

404
00:40:41,336 --> 00:40:44,182
but you bring all these things
to Canajoharie."

405
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:48,292
They agreed, “All right, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

406
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:53,607
And they brought all the things all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

407
00:40:53,752 --> 00:41:00,449
We had no problem of Customs or anything;
I paid them there.

408
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:19,471
How, you see, things can be improved by understanding
what is the most important thing: is to love.

409
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:25,324
But love is truth, and truth is love.

410
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:32,209
If you have love for somebody, genuine love,

411
00:41:32,777 --> 00:41:40,419
then anything you want to do with 
that person will be absolutely obvious,

412
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:44,115
because it will be truthful.

413
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:49,995
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

414
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,667
because it is absolutely truthful.

415
00:41:54,462 --> 00:42:00,928
So when you are dealing with somebody also,
you should be extremely truthful.

416
00:42:01,376 --> 00:42:10,874
Of course, you need not say things that will
hurt him, but you must use such ways and methods

417
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:19,486
that will not in any way hurt the other person,
which will have an effect on that person.

418
00:42:21,182 --> 00:42:26,052
So this kind of a gurus we need now very much
in Sahaja Yoga,

419
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:29,265
because by Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

420
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:36,139
So first of all, our temper has to be brought
into proper shape.

421
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:43,330
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru has no business to lose temper

422
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:47,329
at all, on any point whatsoever.

423
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:54,917
If they can really do that much, it will save
our,

424
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:03,090
 I mean, so much of worry, so much of problem, 
so much of mess we create.

425
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:07,668
All this can be solved very easily.

426
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:12,684
But first we must have pure love in our heart,

427
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:17,541
not love out of some gain or out of some sort of reward,

428
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:25,636
 but pure love if we have, then we can work it out 
very easily, anything that you want to do.

429
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,803
This is a very lengthy thing which can go on forever.

430
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:40,528
Because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

431
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:48,978
and why they are gurus, it’s very important, 
very important position that they are gurus.

432
00:43:49,136 --> 00:43:58,700
And they should use that position for exhibiting
tremendous understanding of their disciple,

433
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:06,327
and also their purpose should be clear-cut.

434
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:13,622
People should not doubt him, should not think,
why he is doing such and such things?

435
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:20,709
It should not be a mystery, it should be absolutely
clear-cut.

436
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:29,464
All these things I am telling you today, because
today we have completed ten,

437
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:33,322
our ten years of stay in Cabella.

438
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:37,552
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me.

439
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:44,948
They have brought lots of people to Sahaja
Yoga, I tell you, very lots of people.

440
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:49,604
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it and

441
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:52,437
said, "Where are You going to live?" and all that.

442
00:44:52,462 --> 00:45:01,836
But here only it has worked, and that should
be accepted as a very good indication that

443
00:45:05,296 --> 00:45:11,531
Sahaja Yoga does miraculous things, miraculous.

444
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:17,184
But the foremost thing is, you must know vibrations.

445
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:21,782
If you don't know about vibrations, then you
can't do it.

446
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,956
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me, “Mother,

447
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:29,452
very lonely place, there are mafias around.

448
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,404
Only six, seven houses there.

449
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,843
Where are You going?

450
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:34,648
What is this?”

451
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,839
They all warned Me.

452
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:42,510
So I came here, and immediately I told the
Mayor, “I am going to buy it,

453
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:45,007
 and tomorrow I'll pay you the money.”

454
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:51,187
He was surprised: how can I do that?

455
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,489
I said, "Don't worry!

456
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,386
Perfectly all right."

457
00:45:55,454 --> 00:45:57,805
On vibrations it was.

458
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:03,864
On vibrations I decided that this is a wonderful
place.

459
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:08,321
And vibrations helped Me so much that time,

460
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:15,366
though everybody discouraged Me and 
everybody gave Me a very big picture, horrible one.

461
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:18,033
But still, where is the mafia now?

462
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:20,868
Gone, finished.

463
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:37,646
Now, to know about a thing, you have to meditate
and improve your vision, which should be clear-cut.

464
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:46,981
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting your particular ideas about

465
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:53,601
a particular thing, but it should be a vision
which should be clear-cut.

466
00:46:55,925 --> 00:47:03,930
With Sahaja Yoga, one has to know the protection
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

467
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,776
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

468
00:47:10,976 --> 00:47:16,140
I am sure you will get yourself this experience.

469
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:25,976
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga like this
you just get meditative, you just get meditative,

470
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:35,853
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that - just meditative.

471
00:47:35,908 --> 00:47:42,199
And this meditative temperament or whatever
is the state, emits vibrations.

472
00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:50,826
It emits and creates path for you, for your
work, for your life, for everything.

473
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:55,580
You don't have to struggle with anyone, you
don't have to fight with anyone,

474
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:58,254
you don't have to argue with anyone.

475
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:05,351
Just try to meditate, and achieve a state
which I’m describing to you,

476
00:48:05,388 --> 00:48:11,984
where you get completely surrounded by love and affection.

477
00:48:12,784 --> 00:48:16,427
May God bless you all.

478
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:39,196
There's one thing is important to understand,
that you should not go to extremes of everything,

479
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,041
which is also a human quality.

480
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:47,110
For example, if they are rational, they go
on rationalizing everything,

481
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:50,109
 “I can't do this, I can't do that.”

482
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,264
Something like that goes on.

483
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:57,345
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

484
00:48:57,421 --> 00:49:04,753
and they become so emotional that they start 
doing wrong things in the name of emotionality.

485
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:07,868
You have to overcome these two things.

486
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:11,658
If you have not overcome that, what's the
use?

487
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:14,474
What’s the use of calling yourself Sahaja
Yogis?

488
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:17,467
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

489
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,258
Going to the extremes must be avoided.

490
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:23,207
Keep a watch upon yourself.

491
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:27,581
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out;

492
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:32,264
you might develop cancer, may develop
 horrible diseases on one side.

493
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:37,099
And on the other side you might become a very
rational person, and

494
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,072
no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

495
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:46,987
So you have to keep the balance all the time.

496
00:49:47,098 --> 00:49:52,193
And with that balance, like somebody is a
Sahaja Yogini

497
00:49:52,218 --> 00:49:54,595
and she has done something very wrong,

498
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:57,853
 then you should not become emotionally attached,

499
00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:00,575
“Oh, Mother, what is it? And we should forgive her.”

500
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,600
No!

501
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:11,628
You tell her that “You must improve your
vibrations, and must come to a balance.

502
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:19,024
And once you are in balance, then I will consider
your case.

503
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,328
Then I will say it is so or not.”

504
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:29,027
But if she has no balance, she goes into rationality,
she goes into emotional thing,

505
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:36,263
and this emotional business can take you to 
any nonsensical thing, as it is a psychological case.

506
00:50:36,288 --> 00:50:40,443
And one can go into very, very wrong things
that they are doing,

507
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:44,295
out of this emotional thing, you see, like

508
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,696
 even singing songs that
are neurotic or anything, you see.

509
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:54,328
All this emotional thing can take you anywhere.

510
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:57,157
So to be emotional is not needed.

511
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,089
You must love.

512
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:05,447
And left side is what you can call another extreme.

513
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:11,803
One side is, is this emotional, another is rational.

514
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:16,638
In rationality you can start justifying anything,
like Hitler did.

515
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:21,057
He said, “No, this was right, I was doing
was right.”

516
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:23,740
He took something into his head and now, “This
is right.”

517
00:51:23,765 --> 00:51:25,673
This is rationality.

518
00:51:25,872 --> 00:51:29,457
So both things are to be properly balanced,

519
00:51:29,482 --> 00:51:38,052
and you should see that whatever you are doing 
are giving you a proper result.

520
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:41,940
So thank you very much again and again.

521
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,808
May God bless you.

522
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:00,579
May God bless you.
