00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,040
سلام برهمه جستجو گران  حقیقت

2
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,480
 دیروز برای شما گفتم حقیقت هر چه است هست

3
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,960
شما نمیتوانید انرا تصور یا تخیل نمائید

4
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,520
و نمیتوانید انرا با حافظه و هشیاری انسانی بدانید

5
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,200
ما بایستی یک انسان بخصوص بشویم

6
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,720
ما باید روح بشویم

7
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,200
فقط ما زمانیکه روح بشویم میتوانی تمامی حقیقت را درک کنیم. که

8
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:13,360
تمامی مخلوقات خدائی  تحت محبت بخصوص
  خداییی خلق و نگهداری میشوند

9
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:46,280
برای این موجود بخصوص شدن در بدنمان مکانیکی است
که راجع بان دیروز صحبت کردم

10
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:09,720
امروز من میخواهم برای شما در مورد نیروئی بگویم.
که ان در باره روح و دریافت روح بما کمگ میکند.

11
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,320
این نیرو در لگن خاصره یعنی در استخوان سه گوشه
 مقدس مستقر شده است.

12
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,200
Diese Kraft ruht im Kreuzbein, in dem Knochen, der Sacrum genannt wird

13
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,320
ان نیروی انعکاس روح القدس در ماست

14
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,200
und ist die Reflexion des Heiligen Geistes,

15
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,680
همجنین روح انعکاس خدای بزرگ در قلبمان است

16
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,400
während der Spirit die Reflexion des Allmächtigen Gottes in unserem Herzen ist.

17
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:26,520
 روح  فقط  ان است مارا  نظارت میکند

18
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,400
ن قسمت از نیروی خدائی که ارزو و خواست  اوست

19
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
که ارزو و خواست  اوست

20
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,560
ان روح القدس است

21
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,840
که روح القدس مادر اولیه همه موجودات است

22
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:08,680
در نوشته ها در باره پدر که خداست و پسر خدا
نوشته شده ولی در باره مادر چیزی گفته نشده است

23
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,560
چگونه ممکن است که پدر و پسر داشته باشیم بدون مادر؟

24
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,960
نمیدانم  انها بچه علتی منگر شده اند در باره مادر اولیه صحبت کنند

25
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:52,160
در تمامی نوشته ها بخشی است  که  اتینا ( خدای یونانی) نامند

26
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,360
تا درزبان  سانسکریت بمعنی مادر اولیه است

27
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,280
ولی با وجود اینکه انها خیلی در موردمادر حضرت عیسی نگفته اند که او خداست.

28
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:21,760
مردم بخودی خود احساس کرده اند که در پشت پرده خدائی است
که اورا مادونا نامیده اند

29
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,120
با این که مادونا  در انجیل نام برده نشده است

30
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,480
انعکاس این مادر اولیه  و ابراز  روح القدس در هر انسان را گندالینی نامن

31
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:02,320
که این گندالینی مادر انفرادی ماست

32
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,960
او هر چیز و همه چیز راجع بما را میداند

33
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,560
خیلی ها گویند بیداری گندالینی ممکن است درناک باشد

34
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:42,880
چطوری ممکن است که گندالینی درد اور باشد. زمانیکه ان مادرمان است

35
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:00,200
وقتی که ما متولد شدیم مادرمان همه زحمات زایمان را بر خود هموار کرده

36
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,240
او برایمان ناراحتی ببار نیاورده است

37
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:24,200
بهمان منوال اگر گندالینی فعال شود بدون هر گونه ناراحتی بشما تولد دوباره میدهد

38
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:49,880
بایستی بدانیم که که این مادر زمین هچیچ دردی را در دانه ببار نمیاورد در هنگامی که  دانه جوانه میزند

39
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,520
بهمان طریق گندالینی در هنکام فعال شدن ناراحتی ببار نخواهد اورد

40
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:17,560
گفتم که روح انعکاس خدای متعال در همگی ما میباشد

41
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,200
گفته شده است  که ما فقط یک خدا داریم پس در همهمان  روح از یک منبع است

42
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:43,360
از ان بابت است که ما بطور دسته جمعی  هوشیار و اگاه میشویم زمانیکه ما روح بشویم

43
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,520
در هر کس روح در قلبش انعکاس یافته است

44
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,480
زمانیکه این باد خنک روح القدس را احساس کردید همانطور یکه دیروزانرا احساس کردید

45
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:17,720
انکه شما احساس میکنید ان همان قدرت نافذ خواست خدای متعال است

46
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,920
با دریافت روح همزمان ما اگاهی دستجمعی را دریافت کرده که

47
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,240
با ان دانش شما میتوانید شخص دیگر را در نوک انگشتانتان احساس نماید

48
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,640
در قران حضرت محمد فرمود: زمان معاد دست شما صحبت خواهد کرد

49
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,760
این همان روز رستاخیز و دادگاه  عدل الاهی است که بما پیام داده شده است

50
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,800

51
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,520
And you have to judge yourself.

52
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,960
The other day in Holland one person asked Me,

53
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,640
“Mother, how is it that

54
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,800
some people will be saved and some will not be?"

55
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,680
I said, “It is destiny."

56
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,160
Maybe those who are here have done such righteous things

57
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,320
in previous lives and in this life that they are here.

58
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
It depends, I don’t know how.

59
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:23,000
In Russia for example, I have to always book a big stadium.

60
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,520
For example there is a place called Togliatti

61
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,520
and this gentleman Togliatti was actually Italian.

62
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:53,000
And he revolted against the Christian church and went to Russia.

63
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,920
And there he started a big factory for making motorcars.

64
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,480
Now there are 40.000 Sahaja Yogis.

65
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,600
I’ve not been there as yet.

66
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,880
And on My birthday they had a holiday for the whole city.

67
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,280
I can’t understand why in some places

68
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,040
it works tremendously in a big way,

69
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,440
many people come to Sahaja Yoga

70
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
and in some places there are very few people.

71
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,720
As I told you, when this Kundalini rises

72
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,200
then you improve physically.

73
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,880
Now, I must say many diseases have been cured

74
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,080
as a by-product of Kundalini-awakening.

75
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,760
We have three Indian doctors who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga

76
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,120
for curing incurable diseases.

77
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,880
And there are seven doctors in England

78
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,800
who are recording all those who have been cured.

79
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,040
But in Moscow there are 40 doctors who are practizing Sahaja Yoga.

80
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,200
Because for this you don’t need a hospital, you don't need money,

81
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,120
you don’t need anything.

82
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,080
It is your own power that works.

83
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,000
And once you are properly established,

84
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,480
then you don’t have to worry about your health at all.

85
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,480
It also helps for mentally retarded people, mentally sick people.

86
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Because this Kundalini, when She rises She is also a redeemer.

87
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,600
She nourishes the centers.

88
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,240
By that nourishment the centers get cured

89
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,120
and ultimately She integrates all these centers.

90
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,080
The Spirit, when it shines in your attention,

91
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,120
then your attention becomes enlightened.

92
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,840
Means if you can pay attention to anyone

93
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,320
and try to feel what centers are in problem in that person,

94
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,560
you can immediately feel it.

95
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,840
There are many criminals from India who came to west countries

96
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:41,280
wearing these orange dresses and became false masters.

97
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,480
Some of them also knew how to mesmerize very well

98
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,600
and they have lynched people because main interest was money.

99
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,480
Of course there are also other so-called masters

100
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,800
in other countries also,

101
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,600
even a person like Freud.

102
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,320
He was anti-Christ, you can see it clearly.

103
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,400
Because Christ had said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,”

104
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,360
such a subtle description of purity.

105
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,160
Such a subtle description of puritiy.

106
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,240
But on the other hand this Mister Freud

107
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,280
has made everyone into nothing but a sex point.

108
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,640
And the people have lost understanding

109
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,800
that these are the human weaknesses.

110
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,760
To such an extent they have been misled that they say

111
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,320
that you can ascend in your spirituality through sex.

112
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,040
This is absurd!

113
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,080
On the contrary, in the Christian dogmas

114
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,520
people believe that you should abhor sex.

115
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,880
This is both are absolutely absurd.

116
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,600
One has to have a sane attitude.

117
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,680
If you see it clearly, the lowest center which we call as Mooladhara

118
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,720
is placed below the Kundalini.

119
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:14,880
Now this center looks after our excretion, including sex.

120
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,440
So your ascent has nothing to do with sex.

121
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,040
On the contrary, when your Kundalini starts awakening

122
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,880
you become innocent like a child.

123
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,880
And that is what Christ has said, that

124
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,760
you have to become like children to enter into the Kingdom of God.

125
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,560
So it is Sahaja Yoga which really explains Christ

126
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,440
and practizes Christianity.

127
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,200
Moreover, the breaking of the Sahasrara,

128
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,440
which is what we call is the fontanel bone area,

129
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,280
is actualization of the baptism.

130
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,800
You may follow any religion, Hindu, Christian, Muslim, any religion,

131
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,440
you can do any sin, you can commit any sin, there is no restriction.

132
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,040
There is no restricition from within.

133
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,280
But once you become a sahaja yogi, I don’t have to tell you anything.

134
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,080
You just become righteous.

135
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,080
I don’t have to tell you Ten Commandments,

136
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,360
you just do it yourself.

137
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,640
You become your own master

138
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,600
and you guide yourself.

139
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,200
And you know the absolute truth.

140
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,880
You can get ten children who are realized souls and tie their eyes

141
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,880
and put one person in front of those children

142
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,320
and ask them, “What’s wrong with this gentleman?”

143
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,760
and they will put up the same finger.

144
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,240
And you ask him, “Is something wrong with his throat?”

145
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,760
And he says, “Yes, but how do you know?”

146
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
Because this finger indicates the throat.

147
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
So, these false gurus who have come here,

148
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,800
the falsehood that they have taught – you can feel it.

149
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,680
You can feel if they are crooks, if they are false,

150
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,360
if they are deceiving you.

151
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,080
First of all you should know that you cannot pay for your ascent,

152
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,160
because it is an evolutionary process,

153
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,280
which is living process,

154
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
for which you cannot pay.

155
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,360
And then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

156
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,680
And then you become joy.

157
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,320
Not the wrong type of joy,

158
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,320
but joy that elevates you,

159
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,320
sublimates you.

160
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:37,000
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness like two sides of a coin.

161
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,320
That means joy is absolute,

162
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,880
but pleasures are not.

163
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,080
When you indulge into any pleasure it has a reaction,

164
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,840
it has a repercussion,

165
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640
but joy is absolute.

166
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:26,400
So, yesterday all of you who were here, most of you felt the Spirit

167
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,840
because you could feel the cool breeze.

168
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,640
So the growth has started

169
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,200
and hardly you’ll take a month to master it.

170
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,880
But you have to work it out

171
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,760
because the connection has to be all right.

172
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,000
Maybe there are some problems within the being

173
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,440
which need to be corrected

174
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,880
So it would be very nice

175
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,160
if you people attend their follow-on and meet them

176
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,440
But the whole thing works in collectivity.

177
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,560
See, at the time of Buddha they had to do all kind of penances,

178
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,240
cleansing, absolute renunciations.

179
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,560
Still they could not achieve their Self-Realization.

180
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,080
Buddha also had to suffer a lot

181
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
in His cleansing.

182
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,600
But in Sahaja Yoga it is the collectivity

183
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,200
which cleanses you automatically.

184
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Corrects you, yes.

185
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,400
Now supposing there’s something wrong with this left hand

186
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,560
so the right hand immediately helps it,

187
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,840
automatically,

188
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,000
because they are part and parcel of one body.

189
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,200
In Sahaja Yoga you have become part and parcel of the whole.

190
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,080
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

191
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,760
So now you can only grow when you are with that body.

192
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:38,040
Supposing My nail is cut from My body – it won’t grow.

193
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,640
In the beginning you will find little difficult

194
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,600
to adjust to collectivity

195
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,440
you may find that it’s not very congenial for you, maybe.

196
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,160
Not with everyone, but some people do fuss about it.

197
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,520
And the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone,

198
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,880
sometimes we also get mad people in Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,360
Then you start thinking, “How this mad man is here?”

200
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,880
and all that, you start criticizing.

201
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,600
But if you take to introspection, then it will be excellent for you

202
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,480
and not to worry about others,

203
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,640
you will grow much faster.

204
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,600
For you are the seed, you are the Mother Earth

205
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,880
and you are the gardener.

206
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,800
And you are the love that is water.

207
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,760
So as it is, I’ve told you, all you have Divinity,

208
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,400
only thing you have to feel and grow into it.

209
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,840
Yesterday nobody asked Me any questions, it was such a good sign

210
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,280
that you all want your Realization, that’s all.

211
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,040
Then I told you that asking questions is just a mental acrobats.

212
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,240
Now, I can answer all your questions,

213
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,280
but – that is no guarantee for Self-Realization.

214
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,440
Only thing, you must have the pure desire,

215
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,120
pure desire to be the Spirit.

216
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
Then it works,

217
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,120
because the Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

218
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,400
As you know all other desires are in general not satiable.

219
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,000
This is the only desire which gives you real satisfaction.

220
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
Thank you very much!

221
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,400
So, are you going to ask Me any question today?

222
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,520
What's it?

223
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,960
He wants to know about the appearance of Holy Mary,

224
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,320
for example in Fatima or in other places.

225
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,800
Might have, it’s quite possible, you see one of My photographs,

226
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,240
where people are taking photographs – and She’s there,

227
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,240
She’s appeared before Me also, it’s possible.

228
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,280
You must see some of My photographs,

229
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,160
it’s interesting how these apparitions come in.

230
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,800
All right? It’s possible.

231
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,880
But unfortunately She’s described as just a woman in the Bible,

232
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,280
I mean there’s no respect for Her.

233
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,160
Must be Paul who must have done it, because he was just an organizer

234
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,720
and I think he wanted to use Christianity as a platform for himself.

235
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,960
And he had nothing to do with Christ, you see on the contrary

236
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,760
he killed one of the disciples of Christ, Steven, he killed him.

237
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,240
He must have thought it’s a very good way of getting a platform

238
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,840
so he must have jumped on the platform.

239
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,080
Or might be to make some money.

240
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,320
We, too,  get sometimes such people in Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,040
What to do?

242
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,600
But he was not a realized soul, nothing of that kind.

243
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,800
Sahaja Yoga will explain everything,

244
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,400
the relationship of Christ with others.

245
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,280
Christ has said, “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

246
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,040
Who are those?

247
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,960
Actually Christ was there till eight years of age,

248
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,640
and then He went to India. For twenty years He was there.

249
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,640
When He came back He lived only for three and a half years.

250
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,560
And they crucified Him.

251
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,440
I mean, whatever He has done is tremendous in three and a half years.

252
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,720
He just used ordinary fishermen and did such a lot of preaching

253
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:37,560
about truth, very forcingly He talked about truth, courageously.

254
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,120
But three and a half years is nothing!

255
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,360
In England I was struggling with seven hippies for four years,

256
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,800
I had to give them Realization, struggling for four years!

257
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,040
They had no background at all

258
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:19,680
And they are now, I feel, they were following Freud, not Christ.

259
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,640
It was such a shock to see.

260
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,720
All right,

261
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,080
so it will take us ten, fifteen minutes for us to get to that state.

262
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,800
I have to just request you to take out your shoes,

263
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,360
to take the help of the Mother Earth.

264
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:42,480
One thing I have to tell you, that Self-Realization cannot be forced.

265
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:56,080
You have to ask for it in your own glory of freedom,

266
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,480
because ultimately you have to achieve the complete freedom,

267
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,920
complete mastery of yourself,

268
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,080
where no addiction,

269
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,040
no habits,

270
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:30,360
no false gurus, nobody can dominate you.

271
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,320
So those who do not want to have their Self-Realization should please leave.

272
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,520
Come and sit, there are chairs here, come and sit here.

273
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,640
No use standing, please be seated.

274
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,880
All of you should be seated will be good idea.

275
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,080
You shouldn’t stand and watch others, it is not civil.

276
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:06,480
Now, please try to understand what you have to do,

277
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,560
and we’ll show you that,

278
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,880
after that you have to close your eyes.

279
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,800
There are two powers within us, left one the power of desire

280
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,080
and the right one the power of action.

281
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,720
So we put our left hand like this on our lap, very comfortably.

282
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,520
You should not sit with a slouch or a stretch on your body,

283
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,840
but just a straight comfortable pose.

284
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,760
Those who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right,

285
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,720
they should just take out their shoes.

286
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,720
Those who are sitting on the chair

287
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,840
both the feet away from each other.

288
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,200
So we use the left hand

289
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,760
to express that we desire to have Self-Realization.

290
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:04,440
And we use the right hand to nourish our centers.

291
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,760
So first we put our right hand on our heart

292
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,560
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

293
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,800
Please put it on your heart. You don't understand?

294
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,360
Now, here resides the Spirit.

295
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:59,880
Now, you take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

296
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:04,640
where is the center of your mastery.

297
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,040
When you are the Spirit, you are your master.

298
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,280
So now, please take your right hand

299
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,160
in the lower portion of your abdomen -

300
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,960
everything on the left side -

301
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,800
because this is the center of pure knowledge.

302
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,600
Then we raise our right hand again

303
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,440
on the upper portion of our abdomen.

304
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,520
Then we take our right hand on the heart.

305
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,240
Then we take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

306
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,280
and we turn our head to our right.

307
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,960
This center is spoiled when we feel guilty

308
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:38,720
and as a result we get horrible diseases like angina.

309
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,120
So please don’t feel guilty!

310
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,520
Then we take our right hand on our forehead across,

311
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,520
forehead across like this, and put down your head,

312
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,000
as far as possible.

313
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,400
Why don’t you do it? Please.

314
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,440
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

315
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,000
Now please take back your right hand on the back side of your head

316
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,080
and push back your head.

317
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:50,040
This is the center where - without feeling guilty,

318
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,280
without counting your mistakes -

319
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,120
you have to ask for forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power.

320
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,520
Now stretch your palm fully

321
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,400
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

322
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,520
and now press it hard.

323
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,040
Push back your fingers and put down your head.

324
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:46,720
Now move your scalp slowly seven times – scalp!

325
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,200
That’s all we have to do.

326
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,280
But there are three conditions.

327
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,080
The first one is

328
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:29,840
that you have to be absolutely self-confident about yourself

329
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,560
that you will get your Self-Realization.

330
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,600
Whether you have come late or earlier, makes no difference.

331
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:58,000
The second one is to forget your past at this point,

332
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,960
you have to be in the present

333
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,800
so that you do not feel guilty.

334
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,600
After all you are a human being, you are not God.

335
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,000
If you have done any mistakes – it’s all right.

336
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,800
This Divine power is the ocean of forgiveness.

337
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:51,480
And whatever mistakes you commited,

338
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,680
it can be dissolved by the power.

339
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,360
That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself

340
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,320
and you should have respect for yourself
because you are a human being,

341
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,320
because you are the epitome of evolution.

342
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,880
Only thing, the last breakthrough has to take place.

343
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,400
So don’t feel guilty at all at this moment.

344
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,400
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general.

345
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,720
As I told you yesterday, wether

346
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,360
you forgive or don’t forgive - you don’t do anything.

347
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,680
That is just mental.

348
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:19,120
And if you do not forgive others,

349
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,320
you play into wrong hands unnecessarily.

350
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,520
And you torture yourself

351
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,880
while the one who has troubled you is very happy.

352
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,920
Just say, “I forgive everyone in general”

353
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,720
and you’ll feel immediately lighter in you head.

354
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,160
These are the only three conditions.

355
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,320
Now please close your eyes

356
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,720
and please do not open them till I tell you.

357
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,840
So put the right hand on your heart

358
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,480
and left hand towards Me like this

359
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,680
and both the feet apart from each other.

360
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:51,440
Now, here is the center of your Spirit.

361
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,400
Please close your eyes and ask Me a fundamental question,

362
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,240
you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like,

363
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,480
Here you ask Me a fundamental question three times in your heart,

364
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,560
"“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

365
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:02,400
If you are the Spirit you are your guide.

366
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,640
So now please take your hand

367
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,560
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

368
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,400
and press it hard.

369
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,640
Here you have to ask another question to Me,

370
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,280
 “Mother, am I my own master?”

371
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,520
Three times.

372
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,520
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom

373
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,320
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you,

374
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,760
which does all the Divine work.

375
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,040
So please put your right hand

376
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,560
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

377
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,520
And here you have to ask six times,

378
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,640
 “Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

379
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,480
Six times.

380
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,160
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

381
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,320
the Kundalini starts moving upward,

382
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:21,360
so we have to nourish the upper centers

383
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,080
with our full self-confidence.

384
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,080
So now please raise your right hand

385
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,240
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

386
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:48,400
 and here, with full confidence, say ten times,

387
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,720
 “Mother, I am my own master!”

388
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,280
I’ve already told you that you are the pure Spirit.

389
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,480
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

390
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,160
you are not this ego, this conditioning,

391
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,080
but you are the pure Spirit.

392
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:22,360
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

393
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,600
Here you have to say

394
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,240
with full confidence in yourself twelve times,

395
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,600
“Mother, I am the Spirit!”

396
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:12,040
This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion,

397
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:19,360
it is the ocean of absolute knowledge,

398
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,760
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

399
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,280
So whatever mistake you might have committed,

400
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,040
it can easily dissolve all of it.

401
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:08,720
So now, here you raise your right hand

402
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,600
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

403
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,640
and turn your head to your right.

404
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:30,320
And here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times,

405
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,520
“Mother, I am not guilty at all!”

406
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,160
I’ve already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

407
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,120
you don’t do anything.

408
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,760
This center is so constricted

409
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:18,760
that, please, you have to forgive everyone in general.

410
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,880
If you don’t forgive you may not get your Realization.

411
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:39,680
So now please, raise your right hand on your forehead across

412
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,680
and put down your head fully.

413
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:55,160
Here you have to say with full confidence

414
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:00,840
you have to just say, don’t say it is difficult,

415
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:07,120
 “Mother, I forgive everyone!”

416
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:34,040
You have to say it from your heart, not how many times.

417
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,360
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

418
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,320
and push back your head as far as possible.

419
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,440
Here you have to say,

420
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,840
without feeling guilty,

421
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,840
without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

422
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,520
 “Mother, if I have done any mistakes, or all-pervading power,

423
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:38,720
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

424
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,840
 “All-pervading power,” you should say.

425
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,400
Now please stretch your hand, stretch your palm,

426
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,720
and put the center of your palm

427
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,520
just on top of the fontanel bone area,

428
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:28,880
and put down your head and press it hard by pushing out your fingers.

429
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:46,240
Here again I cannot cross over your freedom,

430
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,920
so you have to ask for your Self-Realization.

431
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,040
Now please put down your head,

432
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,720
push back your fingers nicely,

433
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,520
and move your scalp seven times slowly, saying,

434
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,560
 “Mother, please give me my Self-Realization.”

435
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:39,000
Please put down your head, please put down your head,

436
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,320
If you don’t bend, it won’t work out.

437
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,560
Please move your scalp seven times,

438
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,440
saying, “Mother, please give me Self-Realization.” (Shri Mataji bläst ins Mikro).

439
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,880
Please take down your hands, please open your eyes.

440
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:09,360
Now please put both your hands like this.

441
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,880
Now bend your head and see for yourself,

442
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,000
if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head or hot breeze,

443
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,240
if you have not forgiven it will be hot breeze.

444
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,400
But please don’t put your hand on top of your head,

445
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,800
little away and see for yourself.

446
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,080
Now please put your left hand and see for yourself

447
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,320
with your right hand.

448
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:20,760
If it is hot air that means you have to forgive.

449
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,400
Now put the right hand again please

450
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,120
and see with the left hand.

451
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,320
Now put both your hands towards the sky

452
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,320
and ask anyone of these questions,

453
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,600
 “Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?

454
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,520
Mother, is this the All-pervading power of God’s Love?

455
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,360
Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?”

456
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,200
Anyone of these you can ask three times – questions.

457
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,040
Now please take down your hands.

458
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,320
Put your hands like this towards Me.

459
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,000
Watch Me without thinking.

460
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,120
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze

461
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:23,080
out of their head or on their hands or fingertips,

462
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,800
please raise both your hands.

463
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,240
I bow to all of you, you’re the saints.

464
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,440
I know some people did not feel it,

465
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,720
very few,

466
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,880
doesn’t matter.

467
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,160
Those who want to meet Me are welcome,

468
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,920
but the Sahaja Yogis should not come.

469
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,840
Those who have not felt should come on this side

470
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,480
and sahaja yogis will work on them.
