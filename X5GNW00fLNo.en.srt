1
00:03:36,930 --> 00:04:21,190


2
00:15:56,114 --> 00:16:04,670
As I said yesterday, this is the field, field
where the light has to come.

3
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:10,192
With so many lights, the field has to be enlightened.

4
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:25,232
And this field which is enlightened is enriched
by nature, too.

5
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:33,662
And when you were singing I felt the clouds
were catching the notes, weaving them within

6
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:40,341
themselves and when it would rain, the rain
will sing the song again.

7
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:51,052
As if the valleys were resounding so beautifully
and the echo was very gentle and filling the

8
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,841
whole atmosphere.

9
00:16:53,841 --> 00:17:00,122
Perhaps you are not aware of the subtle, of
the Divine, how much It is anxious to work

10
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:01,922
it out.

11
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:18,182
But our trumpets
and our flutes and our drums have to be all

12
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,792
right.

13
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:36,702
There has to be coordination, complete synchronizing,
then the melody is played in a beautiful way.

14
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:45,602
Clouds only carry the purest water, the purest
hymns.

15
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:55,322
So when we are spreading the message, we have
to understand that it has to come from a pure

16
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:59,781
source, purity is very important.

17
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:06,092
I’ve already talked about chastity part
which is the Mooladhara, which is so important

18
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:11,102
today; you can see it clearly how important
it is.

19
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:20,121
But that’s not the end of it; that’s just
the beginning, just the beginning.

20
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:34,711
But what we have to see is something very
innate built within us.

21
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:44,012
And today as we are sitting in the heart of
hearts that is Sheffield where the steel is

22
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:54,502
made, in the heart the steel, sometimes you
need a part of steel also in the heart.

23
00:18:54,502 --> 00:19:01,681
We have to see where are we lacking, what’s
our basic problem.

24
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:07,311
We should face it.

25
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:19,642
So as English we are, we have to think how
our brains work, are used to work, how traditionally

26
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,402
we have been brought to problems.

27
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:30,152
When we see around how we have accepted some
things which were very absurd and nonsensical,

28
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:39,512
say in America or in France and other places,
as if we have no personality of our own.

29
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:46,212
What did we give to others?

30
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:50,832
What is the impression people carry about
the British?

31
00:19:50,832 --> 00:20:07,592
Hippies, or what do you call these days modern
- the punks.

32
00:20:07,592 --> 00:20:13,792
What is it that we have to give?

33
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:21,342
Is a honorable image, is a honorable image
of the British, of the English.

34
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:30,162
We have to be honored, we have to be honorable
people, and we must keep our honor.

35
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:44,662
And honor cannot come or cannot be expressed
if we are people who are cunning.

36
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:55,191
That’s very superficial, anybody can find
out if we have that cunning within us.

37
00:20:55,191 --> 00:21:03,592
Now it has been a character, can be very cunning
- that’s what I discussed this morning.

38
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:06,682
Be careful on that, be careful.

39
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:16,962
That’s a trick of the ego, don’t fall
a prey to that.

40
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:21,072
And that then works out in our languages also.

41
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:27,102
Now English language is a specially honored
language now because it is the language of

42
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:30,482
the Sahaja Yoga as well.

43
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:37,492
Of course we use Hindi, Marathi and then English.

44
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:46,282
But English is the language in which My speeches
are, so it should be honored.

45
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:52,672
We must have a sense of honor that comes by
respecting.

46
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,932
When you respect yourself, you respect others.

47
00:21:55,932 --> 00:21:59,872
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot
respect others.

48
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:09,232
And that’s what I’ve discovered that when
people took to anti-culture and all sorts

49
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:16,141
of things the first thing they did was not
to respect anything whatsoever.

50
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:23,701
And yesterday only I discovered that the language
which is spoilt has come through this: is

51
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:30,612
fashionable to speak with a funny accent,
and I was copying that the Americans speak

52
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:34,061
like duck – quack, quack, quack.

53
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:46,742
But the English speak like a crow - caw, caw,
caw - and we have real English language problem.

54
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:49,082
Just now Nick’s wife told Me that she can’t
understand what English speak.

55
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:53,172
I said, “Same here, I don’t understand
either.”

56
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:58,152
It’s a language problem.

57
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:04,522
One gentleman who came from India, very well
educated gentleman, did his MA in English,

58
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:10,511
he came back and he said, “I had a language
problem there.”

59
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,832
I said, “Why?”

60
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:18,432
He said, “They speak all kinds, they divert
it every way and educated people talk like

61
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,432
that.”

62
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:26,112
And was surprised that it has also come from
anti-culture, is a fashion to speak like that.

63
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:29,932
And I can’t follow.

64
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:36,762
That means it is anti-God.

65
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,352
So you must respect your language.

66
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:46,162
You might be acquiring it from hippie stage,
or you might be getting it, say, even from

67
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:50,441
Cambridge or from Oxford or from public schools.

68
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:59,482
Whatever it is, whatever may be the source,
either it is aggression on the language or

69
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:04,451
no respect to the language.

70
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:15,722
So in language, in speaking the language,
try to speak straightforward English language.

71
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,832
Because we are international people.

72
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,122
We are not English anymore.

73
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,712
We are grown to be global people now.

74
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:33,251
We have a global personality, and as global
people we have to speak a language which everybody

75
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:34,752
can understand.

76
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:37,592
We cannot speak cockneyed language.

77
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,941
I mean in India also we have lots of cockneyed.

78
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:48,191
But Sahaja Yogis don’t speak that language.

79
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:55,121
You won’t understand that cockneyed language
that we speak even if you are an expert on

80
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:58,061
any Indian language.

81
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:10,272
So first of all, you must show respect of
your own language, more than anything else.

82
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:17,402
If you cannot respect your country, your language,
your literature, your sublime things that

83
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:23,631
are here, your buildings, how can you respect
anything else?

84
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:29,871
This is your soil, which is not to be aggressed
this way.

85
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:36,381
That doesn’t mean we become nationalist,
I did not mean that, but to grow out as a

86
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:42,732
tree you have to know your soil and you have
to respect and be honorable.

87
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:47,692
Where is that English honor which I used to
hear about?

88
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:50,761
Is lost in the thin air somewhere?

89
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:59,891
An honorable person will not keep back taxes,
will not ill-treat his wife, will not ill-treat

90
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:07,912
her husband, will not talk rudely to them,
would be respectable, will respect the children.

91
00:26:07,912 --> 00:26:14,422
First thing is that he respects everybody’s
freedom.

92
00:26:14,422 --> 00:26:21,922
If he’s mean, then he’s not honorable.

93
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:27,422
If he’s not generous, then he is not honorable.

94
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:34,451
If he disobeys the law, he’s not honorable
either.

95
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:35,761
Why should we disobey the law?

96
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,962
I just don’t understand.

97
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:42,382
Actually English laws are meant for angels
I tell you, horrible.

98
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:45,322
But in that only the devils take advantage.

99
00:26:45,322 --> 00:26:52,582
Doesn’t matter, laws are very good no doubt.

100
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:54,712
But why should we break the laws unnecessarily?

101
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:59,852
If it is necessary, all right.

102
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:05,112
But for every small thing if you start breaking
the laws, then we start breaking the laws

103
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:09,031
of the Divine also.

104
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:11,002
So we have to learn all these things.

105
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:21,372
Let us be in an honorable way, accept things
which are good but not fashionable.

106
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:28,552
Fashionable things - now it is fashionable
to be like this, it is fashionable to be like

107
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:29,552
that.

108
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:37,942
Now what I feel that fashion only is accepted
by people who have no personality at all.

109
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:45,702
Tomorrow somebody starts saying that “You
put a empty tin of jam on your head.”

110
00:27:45,702 --> 00:27:52,962
Supposing, I mean, if they say so, “You’ll
look taller,” or something like that.

111
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:59,402
I mean maybe a little, or let the jam falls
on your face.

112
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:03,781
Any clownish nonsense we accept so easily.

113
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:11,612
It’s all clownish, and clowns are the only
ones who copy like this because they have

114
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:13,692
to amuse people by clowning.

115
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:20,872
But are we to become clowns now?

116
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:28,842
So by this kind of diffidence in our character
that we try to copy others without understanding

117
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:32,882
what they are doing, we are becoming clowns.

118
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:39,251
I mean you can see many like that.

119
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:45,572
So the clownishness is now one of the characters
of the British.

120
00:28:45,572 --> 00:28:52,712
They really sometimes appear to Me like clowns.

121
00:28:52,712 --> 00:29:02,232
Because they try to copy others and whenever
you try to copy others, you are not the others.

122
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:08,281
Like say we try to copy, say for example,
Americans - very difficult.

123
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:14,352
They are so childish and stupid, we can’t
do that good, you see.

124
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:24,462
I’ve seen a film of some Americans - I hope
there are no Americans sitting here - where

125
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:32,272
they had about hundred people, actors and
actresses above seventy or eighty years of

126
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:38,622
age all shaking, you see, and they all wearing
funny dresses, you see, half way missing,

127
00:29:38,622 --> 00:29:46,472
or this way missing, all sorts of things missing,
you see, less clothes than normal.

128
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:54,292
And they were doing funny dances, you see,
all walking with sticks and doing shake.

129
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,962
Or they were shaking already.

130
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:08,872
Now for English they love to use their umbrellas
I think.

131
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:17,622
So they look clownish because you don’t
carry sticks, you carry umbrellas.

132
00:30:17,622 --> 00:30:21,372
So trying to do something that is American
would be stupid.

133
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:25,562
There’s no need to copy them.

134
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:29,582
Even outside, then why inside?

135
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:39,622
When you are a global personality, as in the
nature you can see a mango tree looks like

136
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,162
a mango tree.

137
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:47,732
It doesn’t try to become like an apple tree,
does it?

138
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:53,092
And then that mango, when it is ripe, goes
to the whole world.

139
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:57,612
Whatever is the best mango you can find it
in Russia, you can find it in America, you

140
00:30:57,612 --> 00:30:58,702
can find it all over.

141
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:02,891
That’s how it becomes a global personality.

142
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:05,902
But mango remains a mango; it is not an apple.

143
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:12,902
Who is going to import apples from India,
in England?

144
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,781
That would be stupid.

145
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:23,741
So the personality that you are already, you
are a British personality, or English personality

146
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:32,082
or an Irish personality, or whatever personality
you are, should be such is presentable to

147
00:31:32,082 --> 00:31:35,842
others to be cherished, to be enjoyed.

148
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:38,552
How is it possible?

149
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:46,592
You have to be excellent, first class, top
personality.

150
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:49,852
So this clownishness must be given up.

151
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:56,352
And it has come so much in England that I
feel the heart is absolutely oppressed by

152
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:59,292
this stupid things.

153
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:04,272
But there are certain nonsensical things which
have come within us which we should give up.

154
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:12,172
As I said, first of all the cunningness, then
in our language there should be straightforward

155
00:32:12,172 --> 00:32:15,052
expression, no sarcasm.

156
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:23,432
There’s no intelligence in sarcasm.

157
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:35,702
Saying something nice to others is a great
art.

158
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:46,102
Have we developed that art of saying something
nice to others?

159
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:55,932
This art is to be developed by Sahaja Yogis,
how to say something sweet and nice to others.

160
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:12,531
If you can develop the gentle method of saying
nice things, then later on you will see you

161
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:18,751
will be able to do nice things for others
- little, little things here and there.

162
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:24,202
Like the little girl bringing beautiful pink
flowers one after another.

163
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:36,271
You are nice to Me no doubt, but to each other
and to others who come to us?

164
00:33:36,271 --> 00:33:48,332
So how to say nice things, what to say, when
to say, this we must learn.

165
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:52,842
And so we can establish communication.

166
00:33:52,842 --> 00:34:00,182
Self-consciousness, self-opinionatedness can
never give you that.

167
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:05,092
“I don’t care, all right let him be angry,
so what do I care?”

168
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:11,312
Very common expression.

169
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:14,291
But if you say to the person, “Why are you
angry?

170
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,872
I do care when you are angry.

171
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,462
What’s the problem?

172
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:20,222
Can I not help you there?”

173
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:21,291
Finished.

174
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:29,262
He’ll say, “What sort of a angel I’m
meeting here?”

175
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:34,412
Like yesterday the fellow was very aggressive
and he asked Me about heaven and hell and

176
00:34:34,412 --> 00:34:35,412
all that.

177
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:38,812
I was least bothered.

178
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:42,461
He was neutralized.

179
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:46,102
You must learn, this is an art which one has
to learn.

180
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:51,231
Don’t be proud of your harsh tongues and
your hot tempers.

181
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,231
Don’t be proud.

182
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,082
“I’m angry with him.”

183
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:57,342
So what, is it a very good thing to be angry
with others?

184
00:34:57,342 --> 00:35:03,612
“I got very angry,” you see, with very
great pride they will tell Me.

185
00:35:03,612 --> 00:35:09,852
“I got very angry for that.”

186
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:10,892
‘Why?

187
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:16,822
As Christ has said, only one anger is allowed:
if somebody says something against your Mother

188
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:18,712
that He’s not going to tolerate.

189
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:23,072
But that, too, controlled.

190
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:25,812
Yesterday many were angry but it was all right.

191
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:32,332
I know how to manage things.

192
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:42,491
So we have to learn also to tell ourselves,
“Let us not be so self-opinionated.”

193
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:46,092
We have to learn a lot.

194
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:53,912
There is so much to be seen, so much to be
learnt, so much to be understood, outside

195
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:58,002
also.

196
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:05,112
Like British are absolutely insular by temperament.

197
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:10,612
Another matching with them are Japanese, equal
type.

198
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:16,892
Japanese also don’t talk much but don’t
absorb anything whatsoever.

199
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:22,712
You can imagine three hundred years English
were in India, they learnt nothing.

200
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:24,502
Can you imagine?

201
00:36:24,502 --> 00:36:26,902
Can you believe it?

202
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:34,481
Three hundred years, generations, seven-eight
generations they were in India.

203
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:40,022
While here, when the Indians come, they too
have no personality.

204
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:43,511
They pick up your dresses, they pick up your
language, they pick up everything.

205
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:49,722
They talk with the same slang and hundred
times they’ll say dirty words in it and

206
00:36:49,722 --> 00:36:56,122
they’ll say, “Yes man, no man, what man”
- to a woman also, unisex.

207
00:36:56,122 --> 00:37:02,462
They have too much absorbage.

208
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:09,622
They absorb everything while you don’t absorb
anything.

209
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:13,832
So these are two extreme cases.

210
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:27,962
So as it is said in Sanskrit that what is
the difference between the swan and hamsa

211
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:28,962
and the crow?

212
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:36,452
No, no sorry, crow is black so I’m sorry
- hamsa and what do you call that?

213
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:37,651
Crane, crane.

214
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:44,742
What is the difference between a crane - yes
it is crane, isn’t it Gavin, in the water?

215
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:45,742
Crane.

216
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:54,652
So what is the difference between the crane
and the swan?

217
00:37:54,652 --> 00:38:04,201
So when they have to discriminate between
water and milk, then you can find out who

218
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:08,761
is the crane and who is the swan.

219
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,912
Nirak shira viveket.

220
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:16,122
Vivek is proper decision.

221
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:23,812
So if you put water mixed with milk before
a swan, the swan will just suck in the milk

222
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:27,472
and the crane will suck the whole.

223
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,712
He wouldn’t know.

224
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:36,072
So that is what is, again we come to the same
point, is discretion that we have to develop.

225
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:37,752
[Shri Mataji interrupts Her talk to point
out people] There are people they are looking

226
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:38,752
out for us.

227
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:40,092
They are lost there.

228
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:44,932
They are Sahaja Yogis.

229
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:48,192
I think they saw us here.

230
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,692
They saw Me.

231
00:38:51,692 --> 00:39:00,022
So it is the discretion that we have to pick
up all that is good, all that is nice, from

232
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:04,392
everywhere, which is such a lot, such a lot.

233
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:10,152
Like I would say, what’s nice about British?

234
00:39:10,152 --> 00:39:17,531
Let’s see.

235
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:42,222
Can you tell Me, who is going to tell Me that?

236
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:50,182
Yogi: They have a great deal of tolerance.

237
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:53,732
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

238
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:54,732
Tolerance.

239
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,292
No, no, not at all.

240
00:39:57,292 --> 00:40:02,652
It has to be a common quality, whether you
are a Sahaja Yogi or not.

241
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:08,082
Tolerance is the least, that’s something
lacking.

242
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:14,632
Yogi: They’re good leaders, Mother.

243
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:20,352
Shri Mataji: You think so?

244
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:25,302
Yogi: Fair play.

245
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:34,792
Shri Mataji: Fair play I don’t know now
- that might have been.

246
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:36,632
They were not very fair with Indians, were
they?

247
00:40:36,632 --> 00:40:42,412
They were not very fair with Chinese, never.

248
00:40:42,412 --> 00:40:44,982
Still go further.

249
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:50,732
Yogi: Talking about the weather.

250
00:40:50,732 --> 00:40:56,021
Shri Mataji: That would be bad weather.

251
00:40:56,021 --> 00:41:02,642
Yes, I mean superficiality, but that’s not
a good thing.

252
00:41:02,642 --> 00:41:07,862
Yogi: Shri Mataji, they have very sharp minds.

253
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:10,472
Shri Mataji: Sharp what?

254
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,782
Sharp minds.

255
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:13,082
Yogi: Intelligence.

256
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:16,962
Shri Mataji: You’re near, but not there.

257
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:19,362
Yogi: Inventions, Mother.

258
00:41:19,362 --> 00:41:26,541
Shri Mataji: Not so much, Americans are better.

259
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:29,172
Yogi: Subtle.

260
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:33,122
Shri Mataji: Subtle.

261
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:40,271
I wouldn’t say that.

262
00:41:40,271 --> 00:41:42,252
Not that, not so much.

263
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:48,972
Yogi: They want to help others.

264
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:52,332
Shri Mataji: Seldom.

265
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,572
Yogi: Manipulative

266
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:59,062
Shri Mataji: That’s bad.

267
00:41:59,062 --> 00:42:02,422
Yogi: Loyal, Mother.

268
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:05,782
Shri Mataji: Loyal?

269
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:10,271
They create disloyalties, problems.

270
00:42:10,271 --> 00:42:12,122
They make people fight.

271
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:24,112
Yogi: Once they find something good Mother
they will stick onto it.

272
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:28,402
Shri Mataji: I wish they could.

273
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:31,682
I wish they could, but the way they disappeared,
every time we had programs after that what

274
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,952
I find everything disappeared.

275
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,662
Sticking on quality is missing.

276
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:39,932
Now is all right everybody has said?

277
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,222
I wish you had all those qualities, you could,
why not?

278
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:49,542
So all the qualities that are desired have
been expressed, but what really are?

279
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:53,202
Should I tell you?

280
00:42:53,202 --> 00:42:54,202
Scholarship.

281
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:55,202
Scholarship.

282
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:56,872
Sahaja Yoga?

283
00:42:56,872 --> 00:42:58,702
Read everything.

284
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:06,532
Sahaja Yoga means Kundalini, means this, that,
go to the library, find out everything.

285
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:09,252
Just know it.

286
00:43:09,252 --> 00:43:10,252
Scholarship.

287
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:12,891
That’s their quality.

288
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:19,982
And this has to spread all over.

289
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:24,572
You agree there?

290
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:35,422
The scholarship in Sahaja Yoga has to spread
all over the world.

291
00:43:35,422 --> 00:43:40,192
The women specially want to compete with men
here.

292
00:43:40,192 --> 00:43:43,092
Very difficult, English women, not easy.

293
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,021
Not all, but some.

294
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:49,402
They should become scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

295
00:43:49,402 --> 00:44:00,272
I’m surprised people like Derek or people
like Hesta could not see the point.

296
00:44:00,272 --> 00:44:07,332
Scholarship is the thing and that’s why
they’re honored everywhere.

297
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:09,872
They are scholars.

298
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:15,352
And see now, heart becoming a scholar.

299
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:27,281
That’s the integration of the brain and
the heart.

300
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:31,271
We have so many scholars of Sahaja Yoga in
England.

301
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:34,872
We might get one there and one here and there.

302
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:40,122
Like we can say in Switzerland we’ve got
Gregoire and Arneau.

303
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:49,122
Scholarship - how many are there?

304
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:54,132
And very deep scholarship.

305
00:44:54,132 --> 00:45:05,142
And that is what you have to develop more,
specially the ladies have to learn a lot,

306
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:08,731
is knowledge.

307
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:20,292
To understand all the intricacies, all the
delicacies, and to work it out in that scholarly

308
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:30,532
way, is the way you will really do greatest
service to Sahaja Yoga.

309
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:38,902
And is such a honorable thing to be a scholar
and once you are a scholar, this knowledge

310
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:44,572
goes into your head goes to your heart also.

311
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:49,382
Scholarship in every subject.

312
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:51,332
Scholars are different from inventive people.

313
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:57,742
They may know very little and can invent something,
that’s a different thing.

314
00:45:57,742 --> 00:46:04,262
But that doesn’t mean you go and read Vivekananda
and all that, doesn’t mean that.

315
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:15,372
But you go in every library, every place and
discover the Truth.

316
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:28,052
Blake - scholar, so many scholars in this
country, most of them were Realized Souls.

317
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:34,052
In England we have the maximum number, in
the West I’m saying, maximum number of scholars,

318
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:44,032
who were Realized Souls, in such a small,
little country like that.

319
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:51,012
In India of course we had saints who were
scholars, saints who were not scholars.

320
00:46:51,012 --> 00:47:00,691
So the scholarship part is your responsibility,
and like a scholar you have to be above many

321
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:01,691
things.

322
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:05,582
A scholar doesn’t stoop down to nonsense.

323
00:47:05,582 --> 00:47:08,572
He doesn’t take to superficial thing.

324
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:16,282
It’s below his dignity to behave in childish
manner or to take to sex and all this nonsensical

325
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:19,572
ideas.

326
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:25,302
But the basic quality you have got which is
something so great I feel, because heart becoming

327
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,942
a scholar is something very great.

328
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:38,982
It’s a balance, it’s a real balance, and
that’s the steel, that is the steel of England,

329
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,702
the scholarship.

330
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:48,852
That’s how a New Jerusalem has to be built
in, not the old one where they were only faithfuls

331
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:57,891
just going down singing songs and hymns, nothing
- but scholarship, the complete knowledge.

332
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:02,362
They know everything about Kundalini, they
know all about chakras, they know all details

333
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:10,802
about it and, if you may please, your Mother
has spoken in England the maximum number of

334
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:20,262
lectures, because there are scholars.

335
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:28,871
So preserve that, develop that, then only
you will have all other qualities which you

336
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,572
have described just now.

337
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:36,332
But remember that you are yogis, but scholars
in your subject.

338
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:40,522
Take any subject that you are dealing with
- even ordinary thing, we can say if you are

339
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:46,671
a carpenter you must know everything about
wood.

340
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:51,862
What is this wood, from where it comes, what
is it, what can be used for, what is the density

341
00:48:51,862 --> 00:49:03,022
of this wood, what is the chemical composition,
everything you must know about it.

342
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:14,221
And this is what you have to give to other
people of the world.

343
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:21,112
Once you start doing all this, you will give
up all the malpractices which British have

344
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:22,112
taken to.

345
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:27,282
First of all they are the worst of all, is
to create problems between two persons - they

346
00:49:27,282 --> 00:49:30,961
are good at it.

347
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:38,461
Like, now you see now in South Africa what
they did, create problem between one shade

348
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:41,652
of black with another shade of black.

349
00:49:41,652 --> 00:49:45,411
Very clever.

350
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:49,401
Now when this scholarship was perverted they
were the ones, you know they were the ones

351
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:52,971
who started this idea that the blacks are
primitive.

352
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:56,282
They are the ones who introduced this idea.

353
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:58,782
The same scholarship used for bad purposes.

354
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:07,992
Who gave these ideas were about four or five
writers who said they were primitive.

355
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:19,602
Very nice - brand them as primitive, because
scholars after all can brand anything as anything.

356
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:24,362
So it is necessary for us to bring goodness.

357
00:50:24,362 --> 00:50:35,842
To bring benevolence in this world we must
write benevolent things, write something idealistic,

358
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:49,042
something higher, something hopeful, something
which gives them a new dimension of understanding.

359
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:53,201
All the Sahaja Yogis must start writing.

360
00:50:53,201 --> 00:50:56,971
Ramdas Swami has said that, “Every day you
must write something.”

361
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:11,391
Write diaries, write novels, write articles,
do what you like - poems, poetry.

362
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:21,522
All kinds of things you can do if you just
know that you have to be yogi scholars, but

363
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:25,272
not intellectuals.

364
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:32,742
Intellectuals have the knowledge of others,
but scholars built up their knowledge on the

365
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:34,231
true knowledge of others.

366
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:42,492
That’s the difference between a scholar
and an intellectual.

367
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:49,202
Intellectual has nothing of his own, he’s
a confused person and he doesn’t want to

368
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:54,882
say, because he’s so frightened that if
he says anything that “This is what I think,”

369
00:51:54,882 --> 00:52:06,691
then people might say that he is a man of
domination or something like that.

370
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:14,072
You need not be a graduate, you need not be
anything, but that quality is built within

371
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:20,252
you, which is a very big thing and is very
much connected.

372
00:52:20,252 --> 00:52:33,282
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know that the heart
is surrounded by seven main auras and these

373
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:38,552
come from the brain, which is the seat.

374
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:47,342
Now in the center, at the Brahmarandra we
have got the Heart Chakra, all right?

375
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:57,981
The heart is here and around it are all these
auras, if you see in the brain.

376
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:05,812
In the same way they are surrounding the heart.

377
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:17,302
So if you know about them, it will circulate,
the knowledge will circulate, but circulate

378
00:53:17,302 --> 00:53:28,691
with love, without any aggressiveness, without
any showing off, without any cunning, without

379
00:53:28,691 --> 00:53:42,522
any sarcasm, in a full, straightforward, loving
manner.

380
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:49,981
But for that we have to remember that we have
developed lots of antidotes in England.

381
00:53:49,981 --> 00:54:01,072
Like the words I have seen people use very
common is: “That may be too much; it may

382
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:03,022
be too much.”

383
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,662
They’re frightened.

384
00:54:05,662 --> 00:54:12,272
“One shouldn’t say too much.”

385
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:13,272
You should!

386
00:54:13,272 --> 00:54:20,522
When you say too much at least little bit
will go into their heads.

387
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:28,371
So you have to say too much, say what you
want.

388
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:38,692
There should be exuberance, exuberance of
your ideas so that something goes into their

389
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:42,921
heads, they know that you are sincere, you’re
saying it sincerely, you cannot contain within

390
00:54:42,921 --> 00:54:47,342
yourself, emphatically you have to say things.

391
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:50,532
That’s what everybody did.

392
00:54:50,532 --> 00:54:59,192
All those who were great incarnations said
it with such concern, with such force.

393
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:05,151
In the same way you have to say, without any
fear.

394
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:08,992
“Oh that may be too much, Mother it was
too much for him.”

395
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:13,262
Let him be blasted.

396
00:55:13,262 --> 00:55:15,402
Doesn’t matter.

397
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:22,481
Say everything that you have to say absolutely
with full heart.

398
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:34,322
But when people come to Sahaja Yoga, when
they come for, say, a workshop or something,

399
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:45,141
we try to be the same party people, like in
the party you see, “What will you have?”

400
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:53,302
Then they will say, “All right, let me think
what did I have yesterday, so I’ll have

401
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:54,471
today this thing.”

402
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:58,782
It’s like a shopping going on.

403
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:06,231
No, you have to say, “We have this and please
have it now, otherwise you won’t have it.”

404
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:17,631
This is the time, let them say what they like.

405
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,911
Is important.

406
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:29,641
I see sometimes your SDP conferences and all
this, baap re baap [note: this is an expression

407
00:56:29,641 --> 00:56:32,282
in Hindi to express disappointment], the way
they speak, they just blast you, I mean hammer

408
00:56:32,282 --> 00:56:33,282
in your head.

409
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:38,401
And why should we not when this is the truth?

410
00:56:38,401 --> 00:56:44,092
Why should we not tell them, and talk to them
in that manner?

411
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:52,631
We think by being gentle - all right gentleness
is different, but I mean to say by saying

412
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:57,792
less than I see, understatement is typical
English statement.

413
00:56:57,792 --> 00:57:00,191
“That might be too much.”

414
00:57:00,191 --> 00:57:08,142
In Sahaja Yoga it is such a lot that how much
are you going to pour out?

415
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:10,622
Can never be too much, so be careful on that.

416
00:57:10,622 --> 00:57:15,431
When you have to say it, say it in a very
blasty way, doesn’t matter.

417
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,431
What are they going to do?

418
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:20,322
They can’t crucify Me this time, can they?

419
00:57:20,322 --> 00:57:23,161
They dare not.

420
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:27,312
Otherwise perfectly all right, nothing can
touch Me, and even crucifixion cannot touch

421
00:57:27,312 --> 00:57:31,492
Me, you know that.

422
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:36,342
So you better say what you have found out
in a big way and tell them in a big way.

423
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:42,592
Of course loving and gentle manner, but tell
them, the concern should be there.

424
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:45,961
All right?

425
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:53,002
Now this is what it is, one has to understand,
that there is nothing “Say little bit.”

426
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:58,252
Then they think he is a shaky man.

427
00:57:58,252 --> 00:58:03,522
But when they sing horrible songs on the mike,
eating the mike I say, calling, “eating

428
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,522
the mike music.”

429
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:14,992
They go on, you see, aggressing on the mike
and people go mad with it, they like it.

430
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:21,431
I don’t say you aggress, but don’t say
anything less, understatement is not needed.

431
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:29,242
There should be not be any balancing in that.

432
00:58:29,242 --> 00:58:39,802
Those people who will be appeased by that
will not be good Sahaja Yogis.

433
00:58:39,802 --> 00:58:42,371
They cannot come in the Kingdom of God.

434
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:54,092
We don’t have to be begging of them but
we have to honor them, we have to respect

435
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:56,532
them, we have to be kind to them.

436
00:58:56,532 --> 00:59:00,022
But we have to give them what we have.

437
00:59:00,022 --> 00:59:04,931
Like in the family you go, you get everything
from the fridge and give it to them, they’ll

438
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:06,352
be very happy - take it whatever you like.

439
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:10,092
What a spread.

440
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:21,621
But if you put one little fish and two eggs
for ten people with one chili to say that

441
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:31,651
it is Sahaja Yoga, maybe a lemon, they will
think, “What’s this going on here?

442
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,651
Wishy-washy stuff.”

443
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:40,681
Now that’s one thing.

444
00:59:40,681 --> 00:59:49,981
Secondly there are words that people use very
commonly: “That is very fussy.”

445
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:52,671
That shows your fears.

446
00:59:52,671 --> 01:00:02,553
In Sahaja Yoga nothing is fussy, nothing is
fussy.

447
01:00:02,553 --> 01:00:03,553
Always it is so.

448
01:00:03,553 --> 01:00:08,022
“It is very fussy, it is this is fussy that
is fussy.”

449
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:16,242
It is coming to such an extent that people
now like beggarish existence; they want to

450
01:00:16,242 --> 01:00:26,262
dress up like beggars, rustic, nonsensical
things, worn-out clothes, worn-out faces.

451
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:29,231
I was telling Gavin the other day, “Why
do you all like sand color?

452
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:30,231
There’s no sand here.

453
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,981
Is something Arabic in you that you like all
sand everywhere?”

454
01:00:32,981 --> 01:00:48,382
As it is the hair are blonde, face is sand-like,
clothes are sand.

455
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:56,292
Mountains of sand, walking around.

456
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:59,691
Why not be colorful?

457
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:03,032
Why not wear colors?

458
01:01:03,032 --> 01:01:06,072
Sahaja Yogis must wear colors.

459
01:01:06,072 --> 01:01:07,451
Of course you should not be dandies.

460
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:14,622
I must tell you that, otherwise you will be
dandies, you see, like wearing shocking pinks

461
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:17,322
by men, and sort of thing.

462
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:18,481
I don’t mean that.

463
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:24,421
But you shouldn’t just go about with sand
color and a grey color.

464
01:01:24,421 --> 01:01:30,632
If you start wearing something nice, they
will also produce.

465
01:01:30,632 --> 01:01:34,092
I wanted to buy a sweater for Gavin in green
color.

466
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:35,911
I couldn’t get one light green.

467
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:37,421
I said, “Let’s have one.”

468
01:01:37,421 --> 01:01:38,632
I said, “You look.”

469
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:40,302
No, couldn’t get one for him.

470
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:42,042
They don’t make it - only sand.

471
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:47,822
And I got it.

472
01:01:47,822 --> 01:01:49,762
Or else grey.

473
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:57,522
Already the sky is grey, faces are grey, dresses
are grey, they wear grey suits, the horses

474
01:01:57,522 --> 01:02:00,312
are grey, the world is around grey – all
horrible.

475
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:05,572
And then wear a grey dress to match with it.

476
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:15,552
So, there’s nothing like fussy in Sahaja
Yoga but you should not be childish, frivolous,

477
01:02:15,552 --> 01:02:16,552
stupid.

478
01:02:16,552 --> 01:02:21,572
And you should not be also dandyish, showing
off.

479
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:28,802
Like I have seen people painting their car
with gold and all that nonsense, or wearing

480
01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:39,842
a bow tie and a dinner jacket and walking
on the streets of Oxford Street to match with

481
01:02:39,842 --> 01:02:49,691
these horrible Hare Ramas there, to make a
contrast to them.

482
01:02:49,691 --> 01:02:54,181
That’s not necessary.

483
01:02:54,181 --> 01:03:03,072
On this also you could be scholars, you can
find out.

484
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:11,592
About children, I’m very much worried now,
much more since I heard about this three-year-old

485
01:03:11,592 --> 01:03:14,862
girl.

486
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:20,282
And I have to say that your children are precious,
they’re wonderful people.

487
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:26,412
In the beginning they have suffered because
of you, but they come out of it, and they

488
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:27,492
become so great.

489
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:33,342
But you must learn one thing, is to be very
attentive to your children, don’t neglect

490
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,342
them.

491
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:39,822
Teach them habits by which they do not learn
things which will destroy them.

492
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:46,382
Like every child picks up everything, puts
it in the mouth.

493
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:51,502
We too here in England or anywhere in the
West, people just put their fingers in the

494
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:54,641
mouth like that they will go.

495
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:57,332
Anything they’ll just - supposing they are
opening a can.

496
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:04,782
Now the can spills out some jam, so they put
it in the fingers inside.

497
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:05,782
No.

498
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:09,342
That jam can, might be having some germs.

499
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:13,402
So anything that is to be put in the mouth
you must wash.

500
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:20,812
That’s now has to be the law for Sahaja
Yogis, because so many germs, so many things,

501
01:04:20,812 --> 01:04:23,172
and for children specially they must be told.

502
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:27,622
If anything falls on the ground it’s a very
mundane thing but you must learn how we tell

503
01:04:27,622 --> 01:04:28,711
our children.

504
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:31,492
Anything falls on the ground, immediately
you’ll pick up and throw away somewhere

505
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,492
and wash our hands.

506
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:35,961
We’ll just say, “No, no, no, no, no, no,
not that.”

507
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:42,981
Even from the mouth, if something falls out
you are not to pick up.

508
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:48,921
Unless and until you really fanatically do
that, your children cannot be saved from all

509
01:04:48,921 --> 01:04:53,302
kinds of infections that are around.

510
01:04:53,302 --> 01:04:58,171
India is full of parasites and we have many
more, I mean we are the country where we breed

511
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:01,231
and look after them and cherish them I think.

512
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:11,441
All kinds of parasites we have had, politically
also many parasites on us, but all said and

513
01:05:11,441 --> 01:05:21,062
done, we know how to keep out of them, you
see, and that’s how we have to really condition

514
01:05:21,062 --> 01:05:22,891
our children.

515
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:27,012
Secondly, never to leave your child alone
anywhere.

516
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:30,971
Learn a lesson.

517
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:34,421
At any cost you should not leave the child
alone.

518
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:40,171
You can leave it with somebody who can look
after the child, who can run a crèche, who

519
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:43,032
can do something of that kind.

520
01:05:43,032 --> 01:05:50,842
But pay attention to this point that there
should be no loneliness for a child.

521
01:05:50,842 --> 01:05:57,532
Child must be made to sleep in your room,
maybe another cot, maybe crib.

522
01:05:57,532 --> 01:06:03,832
When slightly grown up, still should be with
you, if there’s a grown-up another child

523
01:06:03,832 --> 01:06:08,772
you can make, or some aunt or somebody sleeping
with.

524
01:06:08,772 --> 01:06:13,262
But don’t make children feel that they are
lonely.

525
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:18,052
Psychologically it will affect, and also physically
there could be a problem.

526
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:23,492
We never, never, never allow our children
to be alone, do you know that, in India?

527
01:06:23,492 --> 01:06:28,822
I mean we are ourselves surprised how the
children just go out.

528
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:33,652
Now supposing some child, say about five-year-old
says, “I’m going to a candy shop.”

529
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:34,652
Nothing doing.

530
01:06:34,652 --> 01:06:39,431
Mother will say, “All right, when I go you
will buy it, candy.”

531
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:46,502
I mean when My daughters were not married,
till then they never went out alone, can you

532
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,721
believe it?

533
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:48,721
Never.

534
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:52,111
Even to school if they were going, they were
in the car with the driver.

535
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:55,692
Even if they were going to colleges they were
going in the car with the driver.

536
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:56,692
Never alone.

537
01:06:56,692 --> 01:07:03,421
And if they were going, say, by buses or anything,
later on when they went to higher education,

538
01:07:03,421 --> 01:07:10,471
they were going with friends.

539
01:07:10,471 --> 01:07:16,151
Safety of children has to be looked after
in this negative atmosphere everywhere.

540
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:21,671
We are very good because we have this challenge
all the time, so we are very careful, and

541
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:27,971
you people have to be now made more aware
towards your children.

542
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:31,842
But don’t spoil them, you spoil your children
too much.

543
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:36,141
I know they are very joy-giving because they
are Realized Souls.

544
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:40,762
But tell them, “You are Realized Souls and
you cannot be dishonorable.”

545
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:41,981
But not at the time.

546
01:07:41,981 --> 01:07:46,492
I’ve seen that you correct your children
when they’ll misbehave, “Don’t do that!”

547
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:47,812
That’s not the way.

548
01:07:47,812 --> 01:07:49,062
Then you dishonor.

549
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:52,121
You sit down with them, have a conference.

550
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:54,602
“We’ll have a conference now,” you tell
them.

551
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:56,121
“We’ll sit down.”

552
01:07:56,121 --> 01:08:05,992
So let them feel, let them sit on their chairs
like a conference hall, and tell them, “Now

553
01:08:05,992 --> 01:08:07,902
see we are all Sahaja Yogis.

554
01:08:07,902 --> 01:08:11,481
You are Sahaja Yogis, too, and the whole world
is watching you.

555
01:08:11,481 --> 01:08:13,701
You have to be honorable children.

556
01:08:13,701 --> 01:08:17,072
You have to behave yourself, you have to do
this way.

557
01:08:17,072 --> 01:08:21,641
We have to share our things otherwise they
will say you are not Sahaja Yogi.

558
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:22,641
You have to have dignity.”

559
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:29,192
You talk to them, develop their personality
that way, so that they know they have to be

560
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:31,211
majestic, they have to be regal.

561
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:35,231
They cannot be cheapish like others.

562
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:39,651
Because all the time we say, “Don’t touch
that, don’t do that.”

563
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:42,161
They don’t know, they are confused.

564
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:49,422
Talk to them, sit down, talk to them - what
is to be done, how we have to behave, how

565
01:08:49,422 --> 01:08:59,151
to say nice things, how to help others, how
to share your things, how to give your toys,

566
01:08:59,151 --> 01:09:02,122
how to keep your things, how to be neat, how
to be tidy.

567
01:09:02,122 --> 01:09:06,542
It’s a training, that’s what you have
to do.

568
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:10,971
And children also learn from your own behavior.

569
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:15,951
Now you tell your children not to drink and
if you drink like a fish, then how will they

570
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:16,951
listen to you?

571
01:09:16,951 --> 01:09:22,221
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also, you do
not meditate, you are not disciplined, you

572
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:29,891
live in a very untidy manner, you are extremely
careless, you do not honor people, your tongue

573
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:35,932
is very loose, or you are very sharp, children
pick up.

574
01:09:35,932 --> 01:09:38,072
They absorb these things so quickly.

575
01:09:38,072 --> 01:09:39,072
It’s amazing how children absorb.

576
01:09:39,072 --> 01:09:41,131
Once I had taken a child to a circus just
- he was a very good child, a Realized Soul.

577
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:42,362
We went there and the joker, you see, he took
out his upper pant just while going on a swing,

578
01:09:42,362 --> 01:09:43,362
so it was a big feat, you see, a joker.

579
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:44,362
So we came home, he also took out his pant.

580
01:09:44,362 --> 01:09:45,362
I said, “Why?”

581
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:46,362
He said, “In the circus how he did I’m
going to do the same way.”

582
01:09:46,362 --> 01:09:47,621
Imagine, that’s the only thing he picked
up.

583
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:52,992
I said, “But that was a joker, you are not
a joker are you?”

584
01:09:52,992 --> 01:09:55,111
“No I’m not.”

585
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:58,651
“And better wear your pant.”

586
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:06,742
So children pick up wrong things because easy
to pick up that.

587
01:10:06,742 --> 01:10:08,611
So don’t do anything wrong.

588
01:10:08,611 --> 01:10:13,502
Another is husband/wife should never quarrel
in the presence of children.

589
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:18,471
If you want to quarrel I can even lend you
some sticks, you can fight.

590
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:23,542
Fight in your bedrooms, do what you like.

591
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:31,721
You can break the heads or break the hearts
or do what you like, but outside your rooms

592
01:10:31,721 --> 01:10:34,502
you are wonderful husband and wife.

593
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:40,572
At least let your children be good, enjoying
husband and wife.

594
01:10:40,572 --> 01:10:49,851
Actually it is stupid to fight because you
must learn how to enjoy each other.

595
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:56,802
So we come from scholarship to the scholarship
about children.

596
01:10:56,802 --> 01:10:59,322
Some people have to take it up seriously.

597
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:05,901
Of course there is a little book which Louise
has nicely done up, but is not sufficient.

598
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:12,181
Some three-four people have to sit down, or
some ladies could do it with some doctor there

599
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:13,522
or something.

600
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:20,191
Sit down with the full compiling of the ideas
of Sahaja Yoga about children.

601
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:28,951
Another one can do the education, because
Sahaja Yoga will be boring for you.

602
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,721
What will you do?

603
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:36,191
So much to be done about the education of
the children.

604
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:42,471
Is very important because every time I go
to a place, there’s a school being started,

605
01:11:42,471 --> 01:11:44,322
“What have we to do for the school?

606
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:45,961
How are we to conduct?”

607
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:52,851
Now why not you people make some research
and give Me the ideas and I’ll put it through?

608
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:59,111
I’m good at correcting than creating, I
think nowadays, because so much I have created.

609
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:04,691
Whatever I have created is to be rearranged
and consolidated.

610
01:12:04,691 --> 01:12:11,112
So I can consolidate whatever you give Me,
I can consolidate, I can put right, I can

611
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:12,112
correct it.

612
01:12:12,112 --> 01:12:15,812
So best thing is now to form a committee for
this.

613
01:12:15,812 --> 01:12:22,441
One for children, one for book on children,
on Sahaja Yoga.

614
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:25,762
What Mother has to say about, you can use
My quotations.

615
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:31,181
Then a book about the education of children.

616
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:33,542
Third book has to be about the married life.

617
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:40,072
That’s how you can go on compiling, about
the social life, about the politics, has to

618
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:41,941
come from England.

619
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:50,971
A series, so much to be done in England.

620
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:56,471
Because people read that, it can be always
translated from one to another.

621
01:12:56,471 --> 01:12:58,002
Is very easy.

622
01:12:58,002 --> 01:13:02,351
So I would request you all to put your mind
to this whatever are your interests you should

623
01:13:02,351 --> 01:13:07,052
work it out and put it in the language of
Sahaja Yoga.

624
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:14,851
Every sort - sports, you can take to gardening,
or anything, even machinery.

625
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:19,042
Bring it to the level of Sahaja Yoga.

626
01:13:19,042 --> 01:13:23,542
Like computer, now all the developing countries
want to develop computers.

627
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:29,022
Now we must find out what are the problems
of computerization, then how it is going to

628
01:13:29,022 --> 01:13:34,921
affect socially, deeply, in the future, what
can happen if we just develop computers and

629
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:41,242
nothing else, how if it is one-sided movement
then how the whole suffers.

630
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:50,612
Like that a new dimension, a new all-pervading,
solution of everything can be done.

631
01:13:50,612 --> 01:13:58,842
And that can be a quite a big eye-opener to
people who do not want to commit the same

632
01:13:58,842 --> 01:14:01,101
mistakes that you have committed.

633
01:14:01,101 --> 01:14:06,542
I must say this Affluent Society and all these
books that Galbraith wrote was very helpful

634
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:11,621
to some people, and that’s how it should
be.

635
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:18,012
So you can guide people who want to be like
you, and you can guide the people who are

636
01:14:18,012 --> 01:14:22,121
like you and who have to change.

637
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:24,191
It should be your idea.

638
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:29,161
Drama - what’s wrong with our drama, what’s
wrong with that and how we can improve it.

639
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:33,431
Everyone of you is capable of contributing
something like that.

640
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:37,822
So those who are interested in different,
various type of things, in this seminar you

641
01:14:37,822 --> 01:14:42,952
can decide what one likes and what another
thing - like even racial discrimination we

642
01:14:42,952 --> 01:14:45,782
can take a subject like that somebody can
work it out.

643
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:50,572
Why racial discrimination has come, what are
the bad effects of racial discrimination?

644
01:14:50,572 --> 01:14:56,532
If it comes from English, they will say, “What
generous, good people there are, how they

645
01:14:56,532 --> 01:15:02,772
understand the feelings and how they …” That
will be very soothing if it comes on the other

646
01:15:02,772 --> 01:15:03,772
side.

647
01:15:03,772 --> 01:15:08,111
Then now we have a problem of women asking
for their rights and all that what you call

648
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:12,502
feminist movement - what is wrong with the
feminist movement, how they have gone wrong,

649
01:15:12,502 --> 01:15:13,802
and all those things.

650
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:20,142
In every subject, even in economics and everything,
you can go forward with the scholarly ideas.

651
01:15:20,142 --> 01:15:24,312
You can take help from other countries also
who - we have scholars everywhere.

652
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:27,562
But we have maximum number of scholars here.

653
01:15:27,562 --> 01:15:31,661
And this is what we have to do in this land
of She-field.

654
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:38,572
May God bless you all.

655
01:15:38,572 --> 01:15:45,701
Should we meditate for about say, ten minutes?

656
01:15:45,701 --> 01:15:56,772
Will be good idea, just to meditate and to
find out what chakras are catching, to find

657
01:15:56,772 --> 01:15:58,341
out what side is weak.

658
01:15:58,341 --> 01:16:04,312
Now if your left side is weak, put your left
hand towards Me and right hand towards the

659
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:05,312
Mother Earth.

660
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:10,862
If the right side is weak you put the right
hand towards Me and the left hand up there.

661
01:16:10,862 --> 01:16:17,512
Now if both are all right, when they normalize
you put both of them towards Me, all right?

662
01:16:17,512 --> 01:16:26,901
For example, now you can tell because you
are in east end, what’s the problem of east

663
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:30,752
end is.

664
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,611
Survey it.

665
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:36,882
You should find out the problems of east end.

666
01:16:36,882 --> 01:16:44,951
I remember you told Me about some Sikhs, what
they were doing, drinking so much and doing

667
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:48,432
all these things which is against, against
Nanak Sahib.

668
01:16:48,432 --> 01:16:54,742
And all these things if you tell, the way
they run after white skin.

669
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:58,992
Yes, that’s what it is.

670
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:02,701
So face-to-face let us see what is wrong with
us.

671
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:03,802
What is wrong with you?

672
01:17:03,802 --> 01:17:05,542
With what is wrong with others?

673
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:10,562
Let us see as a witness, not identified with
anything.

674
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:20,742
So if you tell all those things you see - what
is that, what makes people that way?

675
01:17:20,742 --> 01:17:28,532
You go into it from both the sides, and you
can give real good solutions, you can give

676
01:17:28,532 --> 01:17:29,532
solutions.

677
01:17:29,532 --> 01:17:39,112
For example there are doctors who can make
a book with the divine knowledge related to

678
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,292
the medicine.

679
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:46,481
There are psychologists, they can make a book
- Gregoire I think, Rustom has done a good

680
01:17:46,481 --> 01:17:47,481
job, I don’t know.

681
01:17:47,481 --> 01:17:59,211
Now by the way I must ask who has got Rustom’s
book?

682
01:17:59,211 --> 01:18:01,901
You have got?

683
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:08,872
Derek you have?

684
01:18:08,872 --> 01:18:20,492
Yogi: No I haven’t, Mother.

685
01:18:20,492 --> 01:18:29,792
I haven’t seen it.

686
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:38,152
Shri Mataji: Somebody who is not here may
be having.

687
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:43,352
Who else?

688
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:48,552
Ask Maureen.

689
01:18:48,552 --> 01:18:49,552
Is she here?

690
01:18:49,552 --> 01:18:50,552
Maureen?

691
01:18:50,552 --> 01:18:51,552
She’s not here?

692
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:52,552
Ask her maybe.

693
01:18:52,552 --> 01:18:57,871
Do you think so, Maureen may be having?

694
01:18:57,871 --> 01:19:00,911
No.

695
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:13,072
I just don’t understand.

696
01:19:13,072 --> 01:19:27,422
I think you better see in your office maybe,
Gavin, just have a look, no?

697
01:19:27,422 --> 01:19:34,451
Because I gave it to someone, because it’s
not there in the house, can’t find it.

698
01:19:34,451 --> 01:19:41,982
We had found his book, isn’t it?

699
01:19:41,982 --> 01:19:43,052
No.

700
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:50,632
All right, he’s a scholar, no doubt, and
I wanted Derek, you to read that because really,

701
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:52,372
it’s really dynamic.

702
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:55,862
Dynamic is the word for that.

703
01:19:55,862 --> 01:20:04,392
You can blast all the Jungians and all the
psychologists together.

704
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:10,762
I must find it out, otherwise somebody should
write to him that God knows where it is Mother

705
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:11,762
is very anxious.

706
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:13,212
I must publish that book.

707
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:20,702
So now if you come out with sensible good
books authentic, worked out, you have to work

708
01:20:20,702 --> 01:20:25,772
for a book, you cannot just write anything
off hand.

709
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:40,712
Like William Blake and Sahaja Yoga, relate
it to Sahaja Yoga.

710
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:46,642
Now before meditation any questions, is there?

711
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:49,632
Did you ask any questions there?

712
01:20:49,632 --> 01:20:53,271
No one?

713
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:54,271
Any question?

714
01:20:54,271 --> 01:21:02,882
Yes, what is it?

715
01:21:02,882 --> 01:21:18,062
[Yogi’s question is inaudible]

716
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:19,062
Shri Mataji: Loud.

717
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:20,062
It’s so fast that it’s like Portuguese
to Me.

718
01:21:20,062 --> 01:21:21,062
Can you tell Me Gavin?

719
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:22,062
Yogi: He is saying there should be some organization
by which it’s known whether any particular

720
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:23,062
one of Your speeches is being or has been
transcribed, so that there’s no duplication.

721
01:21:23,062 --> 01:21:24,062
Shri Mataji: There’s no…?

722
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:25,062
Yogi: Duplication of effort.

723
01:21:25,062 --> 01:21:26,062
Because he wants for Your speeches to be transcribed
from the tapes and he doesn’t want to do

724
01:21:26,062 --> 01:21:27,062
one and it’s already been transcribed.

725
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:28,062
Shri Mataji: Are you doing some… you’re
transcribing.

726
01:21:28,062 --> 01:21:29,062
Yogi: Not at the moment Shri Mataji.

727
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:30,062
I used to worry – every time Shri Mataji
has a very nice speech sometimes I just felt

728
01:21:30,062 --> 01:21:33,152
like transcribing it but I was worried maybe
someone is doing it already.

729
01:21:33,152 --> 01:21:34,662
Shri Mataji: What’s it…

730
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:52,042
Yogi: He’s worried that if he does the transcript
somebody else may be doing the transcription

731
01:21:52,042 --> 01:22:06,922
so it would be a wasted effort.

732
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:13,302
Shri Mataji: Agreed.

733
01:22:13,302 --> 01:22:20,732
Now who are transcribing - they form a group.

734
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:24,642
You are transcribing?

735
01:22:24,642 --> 01:22:33,942
Who else, will you stand up, you also stand
up please.

736
01:22:33,942 --> 01:22:37,282
Now you know each other don’t you?

737
01:22:37,282 --> 01:22:45,472
Yogi: Mother I’m quite prepared to take
a list because I’ve got a computer.

738
01:22:45,472 --> 01:22:46,812
Shri Mataji: What is it?

739
01:22:46,812 --> 01:22:49,772
Yogi: He said he can make the list on his
computer.

740
01:22:49,772 --> 01:22:50,852
To make a list…

741
01:22:50,852 --> 01:22:56,802
Shri Mataji: Yes I think amongst these four
who are transcribing, all right.

742
01:22:56,802 --> 01:22:58,472
You decide among yourselves.

743
01:22:58,472 --> 01:23:12,222
Yogi: But there are many more internationally
Shri Mataji and it should be advised to all

744
01:23:12,222 --> 01:23:13,222
centers.

745
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:14,222
Shri Mataji: You see in other languages, which
are being translated.

746
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,222
Yogi: Even in English

747
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:17,192
Shri Mataji: Like say Australia - whatever
I have said there in Australia they should

748
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,272
transcribe.

749
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:24,532
That what I have said in England they should,
in every country whatever I’ve said should

750
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,902
be transcribed by that country, is better
to make it systematic.

751
01:23:28,902 --> 01:23:30,922
All right?

752
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,092
Is all right now?

753
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:38,672
So four of you here should transcribe whatever
I’ve said in England, which is going to

754
01:23:38,672 --> 01:23:40,262
be a hard task.

755
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:52,522
Some more people should raise their hands,
who would like to do transcribing.

756
01:23:52,522 --> 01:24:02,552
Please stand up, Derek and Louise, you take
down their names, take down their names.

757
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:09,302
You give your names, write in on a chit of
paper.

758
01:24:09,302 --> 01:24:17,722
And now you form a group and tell them how
to transcribe.

759
01:24:17,722 --> 01:24:21,922
What else?

760
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:34,322
First of all you must understand My Indian
English, otherwise you can’t, or they call

761
01:24:34,322 --> 01:24:38,862
it King’s English I don’t know why but
they say so.

762
01:24:38,862 --> 01:24:41,234
Shri Mataji: Yes, how are you?

763
01:24:41,234 --> 01:24:42,902
Yogi: Getting better I hope Mother.

764
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:49,382
Shri Mataji: That’s good you look better,
thank you.

765
01:24:49,382 --> 01:24:52,652
May God bless you.

766
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:57,592
What is the next?

767
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:11,902
It’s very, very constructive.

768
01:25:11,902 --> 01:25:25,032
Now editing, once you have transcribed somebody
has to edit it also.

769
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:31,162
Not like Indians - whatever when I speak I
say sometimes, “You see,” “Do you understand?”

770
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:36,222
All these things need not be there but they
think that nothing should be missed of Mother.

771
01:25:36,222 --> 01:25:38,432
But I would say that something is needed.

772
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:44,902
I mean, you cannot go on just adding these
things after all, so we can remove some of

773
01:25:44,902 --> 01:25:50,842
these things, this type of pauses that I’ve
used.

774
01:25:50,842 --> 01:25:52,652
Because talking is different from writing.

775
01:25:52,652 --> 01:26:05,262
But in any case when you do it I’ll have
to go through them, before we publish them.

776
01:26:05,262 --> 01:26:16,902
But so many lectures of Mine have duplicates,
repetitions.

777
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:23,562
So once you have done, transcription then
we can see that, we can adjust.

778
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:30,522
Sometimes certain things are to be said once,
sometimes twice, and sometimes hundred and

779
01:26:30,522 --> 01:26:32,612
eight times.

780
01:26:32,612 --> 01:26:40,412
For example, “I am not guilty.”

781
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:46,332
All right, so any other thing?

782
01:26:46,332 --> 01:26:48,022
This was very constructive I must say.

783
01:26:48,022 --> 01:26:49,022
Yes?

784
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:50,022
Yogi: Mother in one of the Nirmala Yogas there’s
a little diagram which You have drawn of the

785
01:26:50,022 --> 01:26:51,022
Kundalini coming up through the chakras and
going round two circles and then coming up

786
01:26:51,022 --> 01:26:52,022
to the next one.

787
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:55,502
I can’t find from it if the Kundalini is
coming up and going round and then continuing

788
01:26:55,502 --> 01:27:02,542
up the same side or if it’s crossing over
at each junction.

789
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:12,522
Supposing I am doing the right side, is it
coming up and going round and continuing up

790
01:27:12,522 --> 01:27:23,672
the right side every time, or does it come
up the right side, go round twice and go to

791
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:27,782
the left, go round and come up.

792
01:27:27,782 --> 01:27:35,432
Shri Mataji: No it goes in a spiral way and
cuts it at a point, and makes a chakra.

793
01:27:35,432 --> 01:27:40,332
You see it’s a sympathetic nervous system
which is left and right.

794
01:27:40,332 --> 01:27:43,422
It goes in a spiral, all right?

795
01:27:43,422 --> 01:27:49,362
And it cuts it at a point because it goes
in a spiral - that’s the chakra.

796
01:27:49,362 --> 01:27:54,782
But I think we have done that in one of the
speeches, is so.

797
01:27:54,782 --> 01:27:58,912
Once this is transcribed, that will be a source.

798
01:27:58,912 --> 01:28:03,382
Then everything I’ve said, all these things,
I’ve said it in very great details, you

799
01:28:03,382 --> 01:28:07,252
will have to locate it.

800
01:28:07,252 --> 01:28:22,632
What else now?

801
01:28:22,632 --> 01:28:23,632
What is it?

802
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:24,632
Yes, Gavin you tell Me?

803
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:27,572
Yogi: What is to be done with the water that
is used in puja, afterwards?

804
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:35,502
When we wash the Feet, what use is to be made
of the water, how is it to be dispersed?

805
01:28:35,502 --> 01:28:45,372
Say at home when we do a little puja and we
just wash Your Feet in the photograph, what’s

806
01:28:45,372 --> 01:28:49,012
the proper way to dispose of it?

807
01:28:49,012 --> 01:28:51,402
Shri Mataji: The photograph or Feet?

808
01:28:51,402 --> 01:28:57,992
Photograph, you see, that becomes vibrated
water, you can use for any purpose, you can

809
01:28:57,992 --> 01:29:03,862
put it for trees, you can do all these things
external use, you can use for anything.

810
01:29:03,862 --> 01:29:08,922
But if you have cleaned the photograph and
all that and if it is a clean photograph then

811
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:13,422
you can use it for drinking also, is all right,
can be used for drinking also.

812
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:18,612
Because vibrations are such that they kill
all germs, everything.

813
01:29:18,612 --> 01:29:21,642
Because now for Ganges water we just drink
like that, no problem.

814
01:29:21,642 --> 01:29:23,072
It never gets spoilt.

815
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:26,502
You keep it for months together never gets
spoilt.

816
01:29:26,502 --> 01:29:33,012
Because falling from the head of Shiva never
gets spoilt, that’s the sign of the River

817
01:29:33,012 --> 01:29:34,222
Ganges.

818
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:45,142
Yogi: He’s asking what is Your advice about
fasting?

819
01:29:45,142 --> 01:29:51,052
Shri Mataji: No, you can fast but not in the
name of God.

820
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:54,112
If you want to fast you can fast but not in
the name of God.

821
01:29:54,112 --> 01:29:55,472
God doesn’t want you to fast.

822
01:29:55,472 --> 01:30:01,932
Nor does He want you to eat like a glutton
but, He wants you to enjoy the food, whatever

823
01:30:01,932 --> 01:30:03,452
He has given you.

824
01:30:03,452 --> 01:30:08,692
It should be: you should pray over the thing,
you should give vibrations to your food and

825
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:09,692
enjoy.

826
01:30:09,692 --> 01:30:13,592
God has given you everything and you should
eat what is needed for you.

827
01:30:13,592 --> 01:30:16,922
But you should not starve, you should not
fast in the name of God.

828
01:30:16,922 --> 01:30:19,042
Don’t torture yourself in the name of God.

829
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:21,562
That’s very anti-God activity, I think.

830
01:30:21,562 --> 01:30:25,022
Like poor fellow yesterday that Vivekananda
tortured him, imagine?

831
01:30:25,022 --> 01:30:31,822
He’s gone through all that for four years,
too much.

832
01:30:31,822 --> 01:30:37,902
It makes Me really very sad that people are
tortured in the name of God.

833
01:30:37,902 --> 01:30:55,042
Yogi: Should there be a magazine with all
the poems?

834
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:56,502
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have a magazine?

835
01:30:56,502 --> 01:30:58,492
Yogi: He’s saying, “Could we have one?”

836
01:30:58,492 --> 01:31:00,392
Shri Mataji: With the poems?

837
01:31:00,392 --> 01:31:09,702
Only thing I’ll say, poems are to be very
much still to be put right.

838
01:31:09,702 --> 01:31:16,052
Magazine for Sahaja Yogis is all right, but
if you have to put it out, then they have

839
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:24,533
to be little bit, brought up-to-date, I mean
in the sense that they have to be more, sort

840
01:31:24,533 --> 01:31:32,012
of, edited, and one has to work on them.

841
01:31:32,012 --> 01:31:39,462
And the poems should be brought out as magazines
but they have to go through proper understanding

842
01:31:39,462 --> 01:31:40,462
and things.

843
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:48,342
Even sometimes people write funny, funny types
of poems also, like somebody will say, “Sahaja

844
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:56,272
Yoga is my rice and Sahaja Yoga is my daal,
and Sahaja Yoga is my meat and Sahaja Yoga

845
01:31:56,272 --> 01:31:57,902
is my fish.”

846
01:31:57,902 --> 01:32:05,192
And I said, “Next will be and Mataji is
my food.”

847
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:14,132
You see they mean that it is everything, but
the way they express is sometimes really crude.

848
01:32:14,132 --> 01:32:29,052
Yes, there was a poem like that I tell you,
and I got a fright of My life you see.

849
01:32:29,052 --> 01:32:35,112
So, I would say that one has to be little
careful.

850
01:32:35,112 --> 01:32:43,292
You see there are two things always in expression.

851
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:47,622
First is creativity.

852
01:32:47,622 --> 01:32:59,652
Of course, you have to be a creative person
but you must have the technique.

853
01:32:59,652 --> 01:33:08,342
If you don’t have the technique, then this
creativity looks bizarre.

854
01:33:08,342 --> 01:33:18,332
So even if you have ideas, very poetic ideas,
you must have the technique of putting it

855
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:20,862
in.

856
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:25,702
Prose poetry can be also very beautiful but
you must know the technique, you must know

857
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:29,622
the way how to put it across.

858
01:33:29,622 --> 01:33:41,362
Like you may be a great artist as a creative
artist, but you must know how to put technically.

859
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:45,902
Supposing I am a great artist but I don’t
know how to handle a brush, how will I do

860
01:33:45,902 --> 01:33:49,902
it?

861
01:33:49,902 --> 01:33:54,032
So both things have to be there and that’s
what I think, that because of Sahaja Yoga

862
01:33:54,032 --> 01:33:57,902
people are getting very creative and they
are feeling the exuberance and they want to

863
01:33:57,902 --> 01:34:06,672
express themselves but the technique part
of it is lacking, and the subtleties are lacking.

864
01:34:06,672 --> 01:34:11,402
So whatever poems you are writing is very
good idea, like some of them are very good,

865
01:34:11,402 --> 01:34:18,482
but still I think there should not be any
crudeness in it, all right?

866
01:34:18,482 --> 01:34:36,392
So all those who are writing poems, who would
like to write, stand up.

867
01:34:36,392 --> 01:34:39,372
So nice to see so many poets around.

868
01:34:39,372 --> 01:34:51,302
All right so now, who will look after?

869
01:34:51,302 --> 01:34:53,272
You?

870
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:57,202
All right.

871
01:34:57,202 --> 01:35:07,002
You all know them, give your names to him
and send all your poems to him, all right?

872
01:35:07,002 --> 01:35:10,282
That’s it.

873
01:35:10,282 --> 01:35:20,332
There should be nothing childish, cheapish
or anything like that.

874
01:35:20,332 --> 01:35:35,502
Then for art, all those who want to produce
pictures and paintings, drawings, please stand

875
01:35:35,502 --> 01:35:42,672
up, even the children.

876
01:35:42,672 --> 01:35:56,992
Chris, you’re going to do that, good, and
your wife too, she’s very good.

877
01:35:56,992 --> 01:36:02,072
So let’s have Chris there.

878
01:36:02,072 --> 01:36:11,762
Chris will you be in charge?

879
01:36:11,762 --> 01:36:16,612
Please be seated.

880
01:36:16,612 --> 01:36:21,122
So it comes to that we have also two types
of people.

881
01:36:21,122 --> 01:36:29,282
We have people who are intellectuals - easy
chair Sahaja Yogis - as we have politicians.

882
01:36:29,282 --> 01:36:31,342
They good at knowledge, scholarship.

883
01:36:31,342 --> 01:36:33,532
They know about Sahaja Yoga.

884
01:36:33,532 --> 01:36:35,092
They write well.

885
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:46,732
But there are others who are active, very
active, the young, extremely active, they

886
01:36:46,732 --> 01:36:49,192
can work hard, they can do anything.

887
01:36:49,192 --> 01:37:05,652
That’s a very good thing, but I think we
should try to imbibe one quality that is lacking

888
01:37:05,652 --> 01:37:08,042
in us.

889
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:15,592
Like a person who is an intellectual, or a
person who is a scholar, should try to do

890
01:37:15,592 --> 01:37:20,992
other things also, like postering now.

891
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:26,402
So for postering they will not go, those who
are intellectuals.

892
01:37:26,402 --> 01:37:28,892
That’s not good.

893
01:37:28,892 --> 01:37:30,522
Or anything like that.

894
01:37:30,522 --> 01:37:38,062
Those who are painting, they’ll paint but
not poster it, or they would not like to write

895
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:39,062
the addresses.

896
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,752
We should be able to do everything because
we are integrated personalities.

897
01:37:41,752 --> 01:37:47,782
I mean I can give lectures, I can cook food
and I can wash utensils and I can clean My

898
01:37:47,782 --> 01:37:48,782
house.

899
01:37:48,782 --> 01:37:51,442
I can wash your clothes and whatever you say.

900
01:37:51,442 --> 01:37:59,002
Perhaps may be something I may not be able
to do I should say, many things.

901
01:37:59,002 --> 01:38:00,772
I tell you so many things I can’t do.

902
01:38:00,772 --> 01:38:03,242
You don’t know My weaknesses, there are
lots of things.

903
01:38:03,242 --> 01:38:11,522
I’m very bad at signing checks, useless
for banks.

904
01:38:11,522 --> 01:38:18,692
Always the banks put Me into trouble, I don’t
know what they’re up to, and thank God Gavin

905
01:38:18,692 --> 01:38:20,772
is quite aware of My weaknesses.

906
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:28,812
So looks after that part otherwise I would
be sunk, bad at money.

907
01:38:28,812 --> 01:38:34,853
Very good at remembering if somebody has taken
money from Me, but if I have given something

908
01:38:34,853 --> 01:38:38,452
to someone I don’t remember, very bad.

909
01:38:38,452 --> 01:38:44,002
I give something to someone and then I don’t
remember I’ve given it and I appreciate

910
01:38:44,002 --> 01:38:45,692
it, it’s very bad too.

911
01:38:45,692 --> 01:38:47,392
I do it very often.

912
01:38:47,392 --> 01:38:51,602
I’m so frightened now I don’t want to
praise anything because mostly it is given

913
01:38:51,602 --> 01:38:52,602
by Me - it’s horrid.

914
01:38:52,602 --> 01:39:01,362
It looks very funny isn’t it?

915
01:39:01,362 --> 01:39:06,072
That’s one side missing completely in Me.

916
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:13,342
I’m very bad at say passports and things
like that and … what?

917
01:39:13,342 --> 01:39:22,912
Also, I don’t know about ticketing, all
these things I’m very bad at all these things,

918
01:39:22,912 --> 01:39:23,912
you see.

919
01:39:23,912 --> 01:39:28,992
So that’s how you look after Me in that
part, is really I just don’t know.

920
01:39:28,992 --> 01:39:33,112
I’m very bad at time, now I don’t know
what’s the time now.

921
01:39:33,112 --> 01:39:37,742
Very bad at watch, it’s always upside down.

922
01:39:37,742 --> 01:39:50,862
But there’s one thing good, that I know
Myself very well, and I know how to laugh

923
01:39:50,862 --> 01:40:00,652
at Myself, so I never feel guilty, I know
how to laugh at Myself.

924
01:40:00,652 --> 01:40:02,742
I can’t learn now, these things.

925
01:40:02,742 --> 01:40:07,892
I’ve learnt lots of human things but now
I can’t learn how to sign a check, where

926
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:10,482
to sign, what to sign, I’m very bad.

927
01:40:10,482 --> 01:40:13,312
You can get signature on My death warrant
also.

928
01:40:13,312 --> 01:40:17,282
See I’m like that, I don’t know I just
sign I trust and works out.

929
01:40:17,282 --> 01:40:22,832
So far nothing has gone wrong as such, much,
but this is what it is.

930
01:40:22,832 --> 01:40:28,872
So doesn’t matter, one can manage.

931
01:40:28,872 --> 01:40:33,892
And that is how one should look at oneself
- not to feel guilty but some things are missing.

932
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:41,752
But if you can acquire, other qualities also,
will be a good idea.

933
01:40:41,752 --> 01:40:49,312
And that’s what I think should be the attitude
towards Sahaja Yoga, that no work is below

934
01:40:49,312 --> 01:40:50,312
our dignity.

935
01:40:50,312 --> 01:40:54,872
For some people have such ego, “Oh I’m
coming there why not I have a room?”

936
01:40:54,872 --> 01:40:58,324
Such stupid people have nothing to do with
Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

937
01:40:58,324 --> 01:41:01,792
“I must have a special room, why shouldn’t
I have this?”

938
01:41:01,792 --> 01:41:08,563
This is absolute sign of a stupid fellow,
is absolutely a sign of a person who has never

939
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:17,922
known what is comfort, never known what is
money, never known what is luxury.

940
01:41:17,922 --> 01:41:25,092
Is something cheapish like a beggar who just
starts demanding, “Give me five shillings,”

941
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:30,512
then he asks for one hundred shillings and
this and that.

942
01:41:30,512 --> 01:41:34,942
All these things - the one who asks for things,
is not a king.

943
01:41:34,942 --> 01:41:47,352
The one who accepts whatever comes their way
is the real king because he’s mastered it.

944
01:41:47,352 --> 01:41:49,672
This is what is the right attitude.

945
01:41:49,672 --> 01:41:52,532
That’s what a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

946
01:41:52,532 --> 01:42:01,532
Who goes on grudging, grumbling about small,
small things is not a Sahaja Yogi.

947
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:55,752
Sahaja Yogi is a king, he gives, gives Realization,
the utmost, the highest, all right?

948
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:58,282
What’s it?

949
01:42:58,282 --> 01:43:14,702
[Shri Mataji speaks with an Indian yogini
in Marathi - UNKNOWN MARATHI WORDS] She’s

950
01:43:14,702 --> 01:43:17,782
giving a very subtle point about puja.

951
01:43:17,782 --> 01:43:23,472
That when we are doing the puja, say of the
photograph also, then we should have all these

952
01:43:23,472 --> 01:43:29,182
things like a kalasha and all those things
there, we should not just do the puja of the

953
01:43:29,182 --> 01:43:30,182
thing - pratibha.

954
01:43:30,182 --> 01:43:31,182
So I’ve said.

955
01:43:31,182 --> 01:43:33,002
“You’ve come here all the way over here
to tell them these things they don’t know.”

956
01:43:33,002 --> 01:43:39,192
So all you see the deepam and all these things
should be there properly done, for the photograph

957
01:43:39,192 --> 01:43:40,222
also, that’s in the protocol.

958
01:43:40,222 --> 01:43:45,582
So certain things of protocol - now Gavin
is becoming a big pundit you know.

959
01:43:45,582 --> 01:43:50,912
He’s getting a scholarship in puja business.

960
01:43:50,912 --> 01:43:52,092
So you better talk to Gavin, those who have
problems about puja, better ask Gavin.

961
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:57,762
Yogi: Mother I was going to ask those who
know something about Puja should come and

962
01:43:57,762 --> 01:43:59,512
tell me.

963
01:43:59,512 --> 01:44:05,112
Shri Mataji: All right some of you should…
they have to tell something you better go

964
01:44:05,112 --> 01:44:07,382
and tell him also.

965
01:44:07,382 --> 01:44:09,262
Yes, good idea.

966
01:44:09,262 --> 01:44:11,722
Chhaaya has not come today?

967
01:44:11,722 --> 01:44:12,952
No.

968
01:44:12,952 --> 01:44:16,732
She has told lot, then we have got… now
she has come.

969
01:44:16,732 --> 01:44:22,672
Shakuntala is here then we have got this lady,
we have so many who can tell you about this

970
01:44:22,672 --> 01:44:26,142
and you can work it out.

971
01:44:26,142 --> 01:44:28,042
That’s good.

972
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:38,152
So scholarship of puja that should be, and
those who want to do puja now, stand up.

973
01:44:38,152 --> 01:44:42,262
That’s too much.

974
01:44:42,262 --> 01:44:46,162
To know about puja, all right?

975
01:44:46,162 --> 01:44:47,492
Good idea.

976
01:44:47,492 --> 01:44:53,042
You ask Gavin, we should really have about
different marriages, how we perform, what

977
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:56,972
are the mantras, what does it mean.

978
01:44:56,972 --> 01:45:01,572
All those things I think we should really
compile a book on that, good idea.

979
01:45:01,572 --> 01:45:04,652
All of you should support.

980
01:45:04,652 --> 01:45:07,652
Give your ideas, all right.

981
01:45:07,652 --> 01:45:08,652
Thank you.

982
01:45:08,652 --> 01:45:11,492
I mean in the sense you ask a question, “What
should be done?

983
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:12,722
What is to be done?

984
01:45:12,722 --> 01:45:13,782
What is good?”

985
01:45:13,782 --> 01:45:17,442
So that he works on that and we find out a
common point.

986
01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:18,452
All right.

987
01:45:18,452 --> 01:45:21,282
May God bless you.

988
01:45:21,282 --> 01:45:26,572
Sit down, sit down.

989
01:45:26,572 --> 01:45:27,572
Any other aspect.

990
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:28,572
Yes?

991
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:35,132
Yogi: Shri Mataji, I was wondering what was
going to happening about building work in

992
01:45:35,132 --> 01:45:38,992
Sahaja Yoga, sometime ago we discussed Golden
Builders.

993
01:45:38,992 --> 01:45:46,492
Shri Mataji: You have, you are a registered
society, aren’t you?

994
01:45:46,492 --> 01:45:52,142
Have you registered yourself as Golden Builders?

995
01:45:52,142 --> 01:46:01,162
All right, all those who are interested in
buildings and decoration and maintenance,

996
01:46:01,162 --> 01:46:02,162
please stand up.

997
01:46:02,162 --> 01:46:05,322
Vicky, what do you build?

998
01:46:05,322 --> 01:46:14,542
Yogi: Mother, the decoration side, if that’s
suitable and can be integrated into the building,

999
01:46:14,542 --> 01:46:18,612
the decoration side…

1000
01:46:18,612 --> 01:46:29,182
Shri Mataji: Really, then better give your
names to Vicky, all of you.

1001
01:46:29,182 --> 01:46:35,562
Let’s have it because, you see, also I tell
you John, I gave him a good advice to John.

1002
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:41,412
I told him, “Take photographs of My house
and use it for advertising for saying that

1003
01:46:41,412 --> 01:46:42,992
this is the house we have done.

1004
01:46:42,992 --> 01:46:44,352
This is what we have done.”

1005
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:49,142
For example, you can do it by showing your
film the way that I have taken the photograph.

1006
01:46:49,142 --> 01:46:56,872
I mean I have done this, all that you see,
and can use it as an advertising thing.

1007
01:46:56,872 --> 01:47:06,412
So that’s how you can carry album and say
that we are working with Golden Builders.

1008
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:16,552
Yogi: One other area Shri Mataji, music.

1009
01:47:16,552 --> 01:47:22,352
Shri Mataji: All right.

1010
01:47:22,352 --> 01:47:25,212
For music please stand up.

1011
01:47:25,212 --> 01:47:34,892
We don’t have Banam here.

1012
01:47:34,892 --> 01:47:37,612
Is he here?

1013
01:47:37,612 --> 01:47:41,522
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

1014
01:47:41,522 --> 01:47:46,732
Shri Mataji: All right.

1015
01:47:46,732 --> 01:47:51,722
Because I have already asked him to do one
thing.

1016
01:47:51,722 --> 01:47:59,402
So will you look after, all right?

1017
01:47:59,402 --> 01:48:04,872
Can you all contact him?

1018
01:48:04,872 --> 01:48:12,412
Whatever is to be done about music, all right?

1019
01:48:12,412 --> 01:48:14,332
Please be seated.

1020
01:48:14,332 --> 01:48:19,992
Now there’s one another aspect is photography.

1021
01:48:19,992 --> 01:48:27,772
Photos, is should not be all filed.

1022
01:48:27,772 --> 01:48:29,742
Remember what we have done.

1023
01:48:29,742 --> 01:48:34,502
Gavin you have to get all the names of the
people who have… you should give to your

1024
01:48:34,502 --> 01:48:36,032
leaders all right all of you.

1025
01:48:36,032 --> 01:48:40,972
Whatever you have said it, without hesitation
I would like to see.

1026
01:48:40,972 --> 01:48:49,722
Now photography – those who take photographs
stand up.

1027
01:48:49,722 --> 01:48:57,492
No, more.

1028
01:48:57,492 --> 01:48:59,972
More people for photographs.

1029
01:48:59,972 --> 01:49:08,722
Many more.

1030
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:09,902
Those who have…what are you saying?

1031
01:49:09,902 --> 01:49:15,942
Yogi: Those who have taken nice photographs
of Mother, I thought they would stand up.

1032
01:49:15,942 --> 01:49:19,302
Shri Mataji: Some of them?

1033
01:49:19,302 --> 01:49:23,982
All right.

1034
01:49:23,982 --> 01:49:28,002
Where is Don?

1035
01:49:28,002 --> 01:49:37,442
Yogi: He is making tea, Shri Mataji.

1036
01:49:37,442 --> 01:49:41,642
Shri Mataji: He is making what?

1037
01:49:41,642 --> 01:49:42,642
Yogi: Tea.

1038
01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:43,642
Shri Mataji: So, all right.

1039
01:49:43,642 --> 01:49:45,862
So Don … Harris will look after that.

1040
01:49:45,862 --> 01:49:49,322
Ray.

1041
01:49:49,322 --> 01:49:50,552
You all should contact Ray.

1042
01:49:50,552 --> 01:49:55,712
Give him your names.

1043
01:49:55,712 --> 01:50:05,052
All right?

1044
01:50:05,052 --> 01:50:09,912
Legal side is very important.

1045
01:50:09,912 --> 01:50:20,522
So lawyers and administrators, just stand
up.

1046
01:50:20,522 --> 01:50:25,462
No we have here, what about you?

1047
01:50:25,462 --> 01:50:28,352
You are a Custom Officer isn’t it?

1048
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:33,052
Better stand up.

1049
01:50:33,052 --> 01:50:47,982
Anybody police officer, those who are dealing
with government?

1050
01:50:47,982 --> 01:50:54,082
Yes, good.

1051
01:50:54,082 --> 01:50:55,082
All right, you look after that.

1052
01:50:55,082 --> 01:50:56,082
Good.

1053
01:50:56,082 --> 01:50:57,082
You know him or not?

1054
01:50:57,082 --> 01:50:58,082
All right.

1055
01:50:58,082 --> 01:50:59,082
Yogi: Mother may I ask you one thing about
the important side of perhaps purchasing property

1056
01:50:59,082 --> 01:51:00,082
through Sahaja Yoga and maybe the benefits
that could be obtained through use of the

1057
01:51:00,082 --> 01:51:01,082
charity.

1058
01:51:01,082 --> 01:51:02,082
We don’t have any knowledge about it at
the moment, but in Birmingham at the moment,

1059
01:51:02,082 --> 01:51:03,082
we have made some inquiries and now Ray from
Derby, he deals with the legal side of many

1060
01:51:03,082 --> 01:51:04,082
things connected with local government…

1061
01:51:04,082 --> 01:51:05,082
Shri Mataji: Can you stand up.

1062
01:51:05,082 --> 01:51:06,082
Yogi: …and he’s been most helpful in sorting
out our details referring to mortgages and

1063
01:51:06,082 --> 01:51:23,232
so on for us and has come up with certain
information.

1064
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:33,982
But also we’re anxious to know what benefits
may be accrued by Sahaja Yogis if we can use

1065
01:51:33,982 --> 01:51:36,672
a charity to do such things.

1066
01:51:36,672 --> 01:51:56,552
It seems that there may be some financial
benefits here and if we can get together some

1067
01:51:56,552 --> 01:51:57,552
information.

1068
01:51:57,552 --> 01:51:59,932
Shri Mataji: All right.

1069
01:51:59,932 --> 01:52:03,992
For this part I would say David Prall.

1070
01:52:03,992 --> 01:52:05,012
Where is he?

1071
01:52:05,012 --> 01:52:06,012
Stand up.

1072
01:52:06,012 --> 01:52:12,312
Those who are interested, buying properties
and charitable things and all that, who are

1073
01:52:12,312 --> 01:52:13,312
interested?

1074
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:15,312
Just get up.

1075
01:52:15,312 --> 01:52:22,012
Where is Ian?

1076
01:52:22,012 --> 01:52:37,402
Yogi: Mother we have got some details about
the covenant thing from our accountant…

1077
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:38,662
Shri Mataji: What, details about?

1078
01:52:38,662 --> 01:52:39,932
Yogi: Getting money on covenant.

1079
01:52:39,932 --> 01:52:41,452
It’s very much beneficial, tax benefits…

1080
01:52:41,452 --> 01:52:42,472
Shri Mataji: All right.

1081
01:52:42,472 --> 01:52:49,392
So David Prall is to be informed about whatever
information you get, and to get from him all

1082
01:52:49,392 --> 01:52:58,632
the information that is needed, and through
him we’ll deal in property problems.

1083
01:52:58,632 --> 01:52:59,632
All right?

1084
01:52:59,632 --> 01:53:06,512
So let us have a collective thing, all of
you should give your names to him, and everyone

1085
01:53:06,512 --> 01:53:12,282
who is now appointed as the person in charge
should give us a full idea.

1086
01:53:12,282 --> 01:53:17,512
Any problem with your properties should go
to this committee.

1087
01:53:17,512 --> 01:53:19,872
All right?

1088
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:31,372
Now, there’s one more aspect which is the
most important and the greatest headache,

1089
01:53:31,372 --> 01:53:39,842
is marriages.

1090
01:53:39,842 --> 01:53:58,092
So this has to be somebody international and…You
are in that photograph group, all right?

1091
01:53:58,092 --> 01:54:01,702
Who is in charge of photographs, Ray Harris.

1092
01:54:01,702 --> 01:54:02,742
All right?

1093
01:54:02,742 --> 01:54:04,232
You contact him.

1094
01:54:04,232 --> 01:54:10,712
Now make something positive, some plans positive,
make it something, let Me know.

1095
01:54:10,712 --> 01:54:15,182
There are photographs and photographs and
you don’t know where they are compiled,

1096
01:54:15,182 --> 01:54:18,172
who has taken them, where are the copies – nothing.

1097
01:54:18,172 --> 01:54:22,442
It’s all just, everywhere, all right?

1098
01:54:22,442 --> 01:54:28,322
So proper filing has to be done, proper understanding
has to be done.

1099
01:54:28,322 --> 01:54:49,912
For marriages Warren is the best I think.

1100
01:54:49,912 --> 01:54:58,972
Now Warren you should stand up and now those
who want to help in making marriages successful,

1101
01:54:58,972 --> 01:55:05,282
in the sense in advising people, in making
them understand, talking to them, and also

1102
01:55:05,282 --> 01:55:13,292
organizing marriages, future marriages, of
people – like a marriage bureau – those

1103
01:55:13,292 --> 01:55:15,572
who would like to help.

1104
01:55:15,572 --> 01:55:18,282
Some elderly people should come out for this.

1105
01:55:18,282 --> 01:55:23,182
I would like to have.

1106
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:24,182
What do you think Manta?

1107
01:55:24,182 --> 01:55:29,362
You not stood for anything, come along.

1108
01:55:29,362 --> 01:55:32,432
Pat, where’s Pat?

1109
01:55:32,432 --> 01:55:34,492
Who else?

1110
01:55:34,492 --> 01:55:40,122
They should be happily married people, in
a way.

1111
01:55:40,122 --> 01:55:45,782
Yes, good, Sarah.

1112
01:55:45,782 --> 01:55:49,552
Yes, good.

1113
01:55:49,552 --> 01:55:52,492
There are outside also.

1114
01:55:52,492 --> 01:55:54,072
That’s for children.

1115
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,072
They will be for children.

1116
01:55:55,072 --> 01:55:57,872
Those who are outside will be for children.

1117
01:55:57,872 --> 01:56:06,972
All right, so here they are, now please send
your names to him today.

1118
01:56:06,972 --> 01:56:12,172
All these names must be given today, in this
seminar, all right?

1119
01:56:12,172 --> 01:56:20,532
Now for children, last and the most important.

1120
01:56:20,532 --> 01:56:31,602
Call them.

1121
01:56:31,602 --> 01:56:33,752
You are a teacher, isn’t it?

1122
01:56:33,752 --> 01:56:45,552
You are teaching in a school.

1123
01:56:45,552 --> 01:56:53,262
But just now we are thinking of starting a
school in Hounslow.

1124
01:56:53,262 --> 01:56:55,672
But where do you live?

1125
01:56:55,672 --> 01:57:03,012
It’s too far away.

1126
01:57:03,012 --> 01:57:06,682
All right.

1127
01:57:06,682 --> 01:57:17,282
Now how many of you who have children, small
children, and interested in them?

1128
01:57:17,282 --> 01:57:18,992
Let’s see.

1129
01:57:18,992 --> 01:57:21,542
Now get up.

1130
01:57:21,542 --> 01:57:34,352
All those parents who have small children,
all those parents who have very small children.

1131
01:57:34,352 --> 01:57:52,822
Get him please, get him.

1132
01:57:52,822 --> 01:57:55,072
I think David is the best for this.

1133
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:57,472
David will you take over?

1134
01:57:57,472 --> 01:57:58,912
Let David handle.

1135
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:06,642
All of you should contact David about it.

1136
01:58:06,642 --> 01:58:14,872
Now all of you should sit down and only David
should stand so they should know.

1137
01:58:14,872 --> 01:58:22,432
You’ll have to also deal with problem children.

1138
01:58:22,432 --> 01:58:24,462
There are problem children.

1139
01:58:24,462 --> 01:58:34,582
Now we have to find out something where we
can deal with problem children.

1140
01:58:34,582 --> 01:58:37,782
And about that I’ll talk to you.

1141
01:58:37,782 --> 01:58:42,052
Those who have problem children, please get
up.

1142
01:58:42,052 --> 01:58:51,092
She’s better, much better now.

1143
01:58:51,092 --> 01:58:52,732
But what about you?

1144
01:58:52,732 --> 01:58:59,702
[Question from a yogi: is deafness a problem?]

1145
01:58:59,702 --> 01:59:06,082
In a way, in a way it is, because it is to
be treated, all right?

1146
01:59:06,082 --> 01:59:12,162
So, those who have problem children, also
must be dealt with.

1147
01:59:12,162 --> 01:59:18,402
So you can have two things: where there are
problem children and where there are not.

1148
01:59:18,402 --> 01:59:24,682
If they are catching, if they are still not
enjoying life, if they have little problems

1149
01:59:24,682 --> 01:59:33,402
with them, or if they are catching from parents,
all these things are to be dealt with.

1150
01:59:33,402 --> 01:59:42,552
So on this point I have to say one thing,
when we have problem children is sometimes

1151
01:59:42,552 --> 01:59:48,512
the fault of the parents also or may be some
defect in them, or some sort of a wrong thing.

1152
01:59:48,512 --> 01:59:56,122
Now under these circumstances, we have to
understand that it is the right approach of

1153
01:59:56,122 --> 02:00:00,072
the parents can only help the children to
get all right.

1154
02:00:00,072 --> 02:00:04,952
So whatever is suggested to them and told
to them, they are not to feel bad about it,

1155
02:00:04,952 --> 02:00:09,222
but to accept it and correct their ways and
methods and things will work out.

1156
02:00:09,222 --> 02:00:10,702
All right, so that’s a promise.

1157
02:00:10,702 --> 02:00:13,092
Nobody’s going to feel bad about it.

1158
02:00:13,092 --> 02:00:18,472
Is going to take it up as a very good advice,
whatever we have to tell them, so because

1159
02:00:18,472 --> 02:00:21,622
we have to pay special attention to this.

1160
02:00:21,622 --> 02:00:25,772
Specially with ladies I have seen if you tell
them anything, they start crying.

1161
02:00:25,772 --> 02:00:29,412
It’s a water power which I cannot overcome.

1162
02:00:29,412 --> 02:00:33,353
I don’t cry so much do I?

1163
02:00:33,353 --> 02:00:39,862
I don’t know why people should cry so much
and upset everybody.

1164
02:00:39,862 --> 02:00:42,802
So such people will not be allowed to cry.

1165
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:48,592
If they are to correct their children, first
thing they are not to cry and weep and sulk.

1166
02:00:48,592 --> 02:00:51,522
Then only we can solve the problem, all right?

1167
02:00:51,522 --> 02:00:52,522
So, done.

1168
02:00:52,522 --> 02:00:53,522
This is also done.

1169
02:00:53,522 --> 02:00:59,782
All right, let the children go out.

1170
02:00:59,782 --> 02:01:02,382
Because the children still are not peaceful.

1171
02:01:02,382 --> 02:01:03,552
We can see that.

1172
02:01:03,552 --> 02:01:04,732
They are very noisy.

1173
02:01:04,732 --> 02:01:09,102
They are not normal, so you can take the children
out.

1174
02:01:09,102 --> 02:01:29,992
I think most of them are problem children,
because they cannot feel the vibrations.

1175
02:01:29,992 --> 02:01:31,232
You could feel, you see.

1176
02:01:31,232 --> 02:01:34,712
Did you feel that when they came in, the heaviness?

1177
02:01:34,712 --> 02:01:39,242
It was very sad.

1178
02:01:39,242 --> 02:01:45,302
Those who were supposed to do great jobs are
sick now.

1179
02:01:45,302 --> 02:01:57,802
That’s because of the parents.

1180
02:01:57,802 --> 02:02:08,202
I think now I can go or what’s the next
program?

1181
02:02:08,202 --> 02:02:31,062
Yogi: Mother this evening we wanted to sing
something for You, some books.

1182
02:02:31,062 --> 02:02:38,092
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

1183
02:02:38,092 --> 02:02:42,412
Can you hand it over to Me.

1184
02:02:42,412 --> 02:02:48,432
What a very sweet thing you…what a sweet
thing.

1185
02:02:48,432 --> 02:02:49,432
Thank you.

1186
02:02:49,432 --> 02:02:50,432
Lunch?

1187
02:02:50,432 --> 02:02:51,432
I don’t know.

1188
02:02:51,432 --> 02:02:52,432
Am I supposed to eat lunch?

1189
02:02:52,432 --> 02:02:55,752
That’s another thing you see.

1190
02:02:55,752 --> 02:03:07,872
I have not had lunch so far, I think so, you
know.

1191
02:03:07,872 --> 02:03:15,032
So what song Gavin?

1192
02:03:15,032 --> 02:03:28,732
Why not have I’m Your Rakhi Brother?

1193
02:03:28,732 --> 02:03:47,232
Yogi: There’s quite a big job to be done
on taping…big job to be done on getting

1194
02:03:47,232 --> 02:03:50,322
all Your tapes transferred onto permanent
tapes.

1195
02:03:50,322 --> 02:03:56,902
Did You want to appoint somebody to help Germail
with that?

1196
02:03:56,902 --> 02:03:57,902
Shri Mataji: Where is Germail?

1197
02:03:57,902 --> 02:04:01,652
I didn’t see him.

1198
02:04:01,652 --> 02:04:06,372
Yogi: He’s coming in the afternoon.

1199
02:04:06,372 --> 02:04:12,662
We need people who are technically well who
are able to spare time each week to copy many

1200
02:04:12,662 --> 02:04:13,662
of Your old tapes.

1201
02:04:13,662 --> 02:04:27,552
Shri Mataji: Those who want to copy My old
tapes and help, please stand up who know technical

1202
02:04:27,552 --> 02:04:34,422
ways of doing it.

1203
02:04:34,422 --> 02:04:38,472
But we have only one machine.

1204
02:04:38,472 --> 02:04:46,922
Can we buy another?

1205
02:04:46,922 --> 02:04:51,352
Yogi: The machinery is adequate, Mother.

1206
02:04:51,352 --> 02:04:53,302
They’ve got enough machinery now.

1207
02:04:53,302 --> 02:04:54,662
Shri Mataji: Only one.

1208
02:04:54,662 --> 02:04:57,372
Yogi: Germail is well set up for copying.

1209
02:04:57,372 --> 02:04:59,132
It’s the people we need.

1210
02:04:59,132 --> 02:05:03,502
Shri Mataji: You have to come, distribute
among yourselves and [MARATHI] and there’s

1211
02:05:03,502 --> 02:05:05,512
no Hindi speaking people here?

1212
02:05:05,512 --> 02:05:07,622
Chhaya can do Hindi.

1213
02:05:07,622 --> 02:05:12,922
They can go there to the ashram and do it.

1214
02:05:12,922 --> 02:05:20,802
[MARATHI] So Ian is not going to be here permanently
but Germail.

1215
02:05:20,802 --> 02:05:26,072
You must contact Germail, offer your services
to him and tell him that you would like to

1216
02:05:26,072 --> 02:05:27,072
do that.

1217
02:05:27,072 --> 02:05:28,792
How many there are, who can spare?

1218
02:05:28,792 --> 02:05:30,112
Derek you got up also.

1219
02:05:30,112 --> 02:05:32,182
Can you come to the ashram sometimes?

1220
02:05:32,182 --> 02:05:36,822
Yogi: I’ve got copying facilities in Cambridge,
Mother.

1221
02:05:36,822 --> 02:05:44,952
They send me single tapes and I copy twenty
or forty at a time.

1222
02:05:44,952 --> 02:05:47,272
Shri Mataji: All right.

1223
02:05:47,272 --> 02:05:48,272
Some people who can spare a day.

1224
02:05:48,272 --> 02:05:49,272
Yogi: One day each week.

1225
02:05:49,272 --> 02:06:00,812
Come on, there should be a lot of people who
can do it, in London, at Chelsham Road.

1226
02:06:00,812 --> 02:06:06,602
Shri Mataji: Will you give your names to Germail?

1227
02:06:06,602 --> 02:06:07,702
Some more people should come round.

1228
02:06:07,702 --> 02:06:08,842
It’s a tremendous task, you see.

1229
02:06:08,842 --> 02:06:09,842
Yogi: All go back to 1974.

1230
02:06:09,842 --> 02:06:10,842
They are all deteriorating and Mother’s
tapes are going to be lost if we don’t do

1231
02:06:10,842 --> 02:06:11,842
it quickly.

1232
02:06:11,842 --> 02:06:17,342
We also need to spend money on a digital recorder
to make it permanent.

1233
02:06:17,342 --> 02:06:23,792
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

1234
02:06:23,792 --> 02:06:41,472
It’s very important.

1235
02:06:41,472 --> 02:06:47,352
Children are in a bad shape Left Nahbi is
catching.

1236
02:06:47,352 --> 02:06:56,202
Wrong with, something wrong with the mothers.

1237
02:06:56,202 --> 02:06:57,822
What is it?

1238
02:06:57,822 --> 02:07:06,782
Now what I’m saying, this is to be done
when I am gone, all of you, should give your

1239
02:07:06,782 --> 02:07:09,092
names to…remember, I hope you remember.

1240
02:07:09,092 --> 02:07:13,882
Because you stood up and sat down, stood up
and sat down, but now remember when you stood

1241
02:07:13,882 --> 02:07:15,772
up, you see.

1242
02:07:15,772 --> 02:07:17,672
One may forget.

1243
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:27,792
Yogi: He’s saying that there must be some
people who would be prepared to write articles

1244
02:07:27,792 --> 02:07:45,182
about Sahaja Yoga for publication in the magazines
and newspapers, and we should make an effort

1245
02:07:45,182 --> 02:07:47,972
on that line.

1246
02:07:47,972 --> 02:07:48,972
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1247
02:07:48,972 --> 02:07:49,972
That’s one side of it.

1248
02:07:49,972 --> 02:07:56,052
Newspaper cuttings and things now, I was thinking
of John Noyce if he’s here, I don’t know.

1249
02:07:56,052 --> 02:07:57,052
Are you?

1250
02:07:57,052 --> 02:08:00,422
He’s the one who should be in charge of
that, John Noyce.

1251
02:08:00,422 --> 02:08:01,712
Will you stand up?

1252
02:08:01,712 --> 02:08:04,872
Now will you stand up all those who want to
do that?

1253
02:08:04,872 --> 02:08:16,492
Is compiling of all newspaper cuttings, from
all over the world, compiling all articles

1254
02:08:16,492 --> 02:08:19,232
which are to be published.

1255
02:08:19,232 --> 02:08:24,912
You mean to say in the magazines?

1256
02:08:24,912 --> 02:08:36,592
What did he say?

1257
02:08:36,592 --> 02:08:45,782
Yogi: He’s saying that people should start
writing now, for publication and that it should

1258
02:08:45,782 --> 02:08:46,782
all be edited and sent in.

1259
02:08:46,782 --> 02:08:47,782
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1260
02:08:47,782 --> 02:08:48,782
That’s it.

1261
02:08:48,782 --> 02:08:53,492
But also we have newspaper cuttings everywhere
which are to be put into one file and to be

1262
02:08:53,492 --> 02:08:54,512
studied and marked.

1263
02:08:54,512 --> 02:08:59,892
Yogi: That’s one job which is very good
for John to do.

1264
02:08:59,892 --> 02:09:02,122
He’s very good at that.

1265
02:09:02,122 --> 02:09:04,362
Another team with David perhaps.

1266
02:09:04,362 --> 02:09:05,712
Shri Mataji: Now.

1267
02:09:05,712 --> 02:09:11,472
For David is for property and all that we’ve
given him one job, is sufficient to kill him

1268
02:09:11,472 --> 02:09:12,512
with one job.

1269
02:09:12,512 --> 02:09:17,532
But you can join him in this, I mean in the
sense you can belong to that party as well.

1270
02:09:17,532 --> 02:09:23,412
So now those who want to compile all that
is interviewed, all the newspapers, every

1271
02:09:23,412 --> 02:09:29,052
cutting and also your own contributions, please
stand up.

1272
02:09:29,052 --> 02:09:33,622
This is not only writing, but compiling.

1273
02:09:33,622 --> 02:09:34,742
That’s good.

1274
02:09:34,742 --> 02:09:36,242
Valerie is good.

1275
02:09:36,242 --> 02:09:48,702
For example also we can say what we can do,
how to have our pamphlets and brochures and

1276
02:09:48,702 --> 02:09:50,932
these are to be done up to that point.

1277
02:09:50,932 --> 02:09:52,252
All right?

1278
02:09:52,252 --> 02:09:53,562
That’s one.

1279
02:09:53,562 --> 02:09:58,302
So we come to another very delicate thing
is contacts.

1280
02:09:58,302 --> 02:09:59,682
Now so?

1281
02:09:59,682 --> 02:10:01,852
That’s it.

1282
02:10:01,852 --> 02:10:10,782
Contacts with the television, and other publicity
things.

1283
02:10:10,782 --> 02:10:18,162
Now whatever is our own publicity should be
done by John Noyce but to contact others and

1284
02:10:18,162 --> 02:10:19,162
all that.

1285
02:10:19,162 --> 02:10:20,162
Valerie?

1286
02:10:20,162 --> 02:10:22,212
Yogi: What about John Glover, Mother?

1287
02:10:22,212 --> 02:10:26,132
Shri Mataji: Oh, where is John Glover?

1288
02:10:26,132 --> 02:10:31,422
No that’s for something else.

1289
02:10:31,422 --> 02:10:34,232
But I was thinking Valerie is better for this.

1290
02:10:34,232 --> 02:10:35,232
Will you take over?

1291
02:10:35,232 --> 02:10:36,552
Please stand up.

1292
02:10:36,552 --> 02:10:44,562
Now those who want to go to the programs,
if we arrange some sort of a drama, something

1293
02:10:44,562 --> 02:10:56,992
or we arrange anything related to the - for
the television or publicity anywhere else

1294
02:10:56,992 --> 02:11:05,162
outside, through other agencies, please stand
up.

1295
02:11:05,162 --> 02:11:11,122
Good.

1296
02:11:11,122 --> 02:11:13,562
Bogdan and John Noyce.

1297
02:11:13,562 --> 02:11:18,252
I didn’t see Bogdan, where is he?

1298
02:11:18,252 --> 02:11:20,322
All right.

1299
02:11:20,322 --> 02:11:25,932
So you be one of the parties with them, but
leader is Valerie.

1300
02:11:25,932 --> 02:11:27,812
All right?

1301
02:11:27,812 --> 02:11:33,482
Please be seated.

1302
02:11:33,482 --> 02:11:38,312
But remember that you have promised all these
things in My presence.

1303
02:11:38,312 --> 02:11:42,992
Practically we have covered lots of things.

1304
02:11:42,992 --> 02:11:44,962
Let’s see how much we achieve.

1305
02:11:44,962 --> 02:11:49,372
So Paul what are you in charge?

1306
02:11:49,372 --> 02:11:50,372
Computerization of everything.

1307
02:11:50,372 --> 02:11:52,042
Yogi: Not at the moment, Mother.

1308
02:11:52,042 --> 02:11:55,652
Shri Mataji: All right.

1309
02:11:55,652 --> 02:11:57,072
You stand up for that.

1310
02:11:57,072 --> 02:11:58,072
Now here is Paul.

1311
02:11:58,072 --> 02:12:03,002
Yogi: I’m pleased to say, Mother, that the
equipment we make is selling very well in

1312
02:12:03,002 --> 02:12:04,152
India.

1313
02:12:04,152 --> 02:12:13,322
We’re selling Marathi, Gujrati, Bengali,
Tamil systems, everything.

1314
02:12:13,322 --> 02:12:23,482
Shri Mataji: So all that sort of typing, of
computerizing, Paul is in charge.

1315
02:12:23,482 --> 02:12:25,512
Now those who want to help him in that, who
are good at computerizing, giving ideas on

1316
02:12:25,512 --> 02:12:26,512
that please stand up.

1317
02:12:26,512 --> 02:12:27,512
All right.

1318
02:12:27,512 --> 02:12:28,512
Who else?

1319
02:12:28,512 --> 02:12:29,512
Germail, also Germail.

1320
02:12:29,512 --> 02:12:30,512
Good.

1321
02:12:30,512 --> 02:12:46,142
So now please write down all their names in
one paper.

1322
02:12:46,142 --> 02:12:48,042
That you can tell later.

1323
02:12:48,042 --> 02:12:49,472
All right?

1324
02:12:49,472 --> 02:12:51,912
Brian has done a good job.

1325
02:12:51,912 --> 02:13:03,492
There’s a series of seekers and actually
in one of the programs one boy gets Realization

1326
02:13:03,492 --> 02:13:13,832
in front of My photograph and they show My
photograph on the television.

1327
02:13:13,832 --> 02:13:23,912
But that is in Auckland.

1328
02:13:23,912 --> 02:13:30,262
That is in New Zealand where we have a very
great dynamic Prime Minister.

1329
02:13:30,262 --> 02:13:36,862
I think after Sadat, I feel he is another
person who is a Realized soul.

1330
02:13:36,862 --> 02:13:43,202
I hope the Prime Minister here also gets Realization
or we get somebody who is a Realized soul,

1331
02:13:43,202 --> 02:13:46,662
one of the two.

1332
02:13:46,662 --> 02:13:50,372
I hope she gets it.

1333
02:13:50,372 --> 02:13:59,082
Pray for it.

1334
02:13:59,082 --> 02:14:01,942
So can we go now?

1335
02:14:01,942 --> 02:14:06,762
What’s the lunchtime business?

1336
02:14:06,762 --> 02:14:14,002
Yogi: Lunch is coming, Shri Mataji.

1337
02:14:14,002 --> 02:14:17,622
Shri Mataji: Here?

1338
02:14:17,622 --> 02:14:18,672
And nobody’s going to eat now.

1339
02:14:18,672 --> 02:14:20,222
I’m the only person who is going to eat?

1340
02:14:20,222 --> 02:14:21,542
[Yogi says something inaudible]

1341
02:14:21,542 --> 02:14:23,192
Shri Mataji: All of us.

1342
02:14:23,192 --> 02:14:24,502
Then it’s all right.

1343
02:14:24,502 --> 02:14:26,612
What’s that Gavin?

1344
02:14:26,612 --> 02:14:33,562
[Yogi says something inaudible]

1345
02:14:33,562 --> 02:14:40,512
Shri Mataji: Just … [laughter]

1346
02:14:40,512 --> 02:14:47,472
Thank you very much.

1347
02:14:47,472 --> 02:14:52,682
That’s quite heavy.

1348
02:14:52,682 --> 02:14:56,162
All right.

1349
02:14:56,162 --> 02:15:03,112
May God bless you.

1350
02:15:03,112 --> 02:15:06,002
You can open it and show them.

1351
02:15:06,002 --> 02:15:11,572
That’s what they make here, and I mean there
was no need but they said I have to remember.

1352
02:15:11,572 --> 02:15:21,082
I would in any case remember and but now that’s
their idea, what am I to do?

1353
02:15:21,082 --> 02:15:33,742
Something that they make here.

1354
02:15:33,742 --> 02:15:46,942
That’s it.

1355
02:15:46,942 --> 02:15:53,542
See.

1356
02:15:53,542 --> 02:16:22,602
Oh what a beautiful design.

1357
02:16:22,602 --> 02:16:23,602
Is in Sheffield?

1358
02:16:23,602 --> 02:16:24,972
Yogi: Yes, made in Sheffield.

1359
02:16:24,972 --> 02:16:28,252
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful design, isn’t
it?

1360
02:16:28,252 --> 02:16:33,682
It’s better than what you showed Me.

1361
02:16:33,682 --> 02:16:36,782
That’s the third one.

1362
02:16:36,782 --> 02:16:39,352
Now we put it here.

1363
02:16:39,352 --> 02:16:43,872
It’s beautiful and this I will see every
day, morning.

1364
02:16:43,872 --> 02:16:45,972
It’s beautiful.

1365
02:16:45,972 --> 02:16:49,332
Very beautiful design I must say.

1366
02:16:49,332 --> 02:17:00,122
You know we copied this in the… we have
got this design, we use it in Calcutta.

1367
02:17:00,122 --> 02:17:02,542
Really.

1368
02:17:02,542 --> 02:17:07,382
Believe Me.

1369
02:17:07,382 --> 02:17:12,222
It’s beautiful.

1370
02:17:12,222 --> 02:17:23,052
What a beauty.

1371
02:17:23,052 --> 02:17:26,362
Four pieces you got.

1372
02:17:26,362 --> 02:17:29,132
It’s beautiful.

1373
02:17:29,132 --> 02:17:33,272
Look at that.

1374
02:17:33,272 --> 02:17:40,192
[applause] Thank you very much.

1375
02:17:40,192 --> 02:17:42,952
Thank you.

1376
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:58,870
I thank all the Sheffield Sahaja Yogis for
such a beautiful gift and this I will have

1377
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:00,360
every day.

1378
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:02,010
Thank you very much.

1379
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:07,010
May God bless you.

1380
02:18:07,010 --> 02:18:09,690
You better keep it back into the box I think,
properly done.

1381
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,950
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

1382
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:12,560
You all can have a look.

1383
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:13,760
Let them see.

1384
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,810
The design is very nice and delicate.

1385
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:18,370
Who’s got it?

1386
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:19,930
Warren, you did.

1387
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:24,580
Yogi: I got it with [INAUDIBLE] this morning.

1388
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:26,630
Shri Mataji: Really?

1389
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:30,040
No this I didn’t see.

1390
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:35,130
The one I saw was, it has that design you
know.

1391
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:37,220
That didn’t have any design.

1392
02:18:41,037 --> 02:18:45,126
Yogi: They couldn’t get the one You wanted
so this is the replacement.

1393
02:18:45,230 --> 02:18:47,841
This is cheaper.

1394
02:18:52,530 --> 02:18:54,023
Shri Mataji: Really.

1395
02:18:55,355 --> 02:18:56,355
Sahaj.

1396
02:19:02,399 --> 02:19:04,238
It’s from the same shop.

1397
02:19:08,807 --> 02:19:10,577
It’s such a beautiful thing.

1398
02:19:10,602 --> 02:19:12,612
And also very sensibly-sized you see.

1399
02:19:12,612 --> 02:19:14,992
That one was a jumbo one.

1400
02:19:14,992 --> 02:19:16,012
All right.

1401
02:19:16,012 --> 02:19:19,172
So should we have some music?

1402
02:19:19,172 --> 02:19:25,052
And, Gavin if you want I’ll eat, otherwise
I better go.

1403
02:19:25,052 --> 02:19:30,902
I don’t want to trouble you people because
I had a meal.

1404
02:19:30,902 --> 02:19:34,472
No because … why to bother.

1405
02:19:34,472 --> 02:19:36,262
All right.

1406
02:19:36,262 --> 02:19:40,742
So, let’s have this one.

1407
02:19:40,742 --> 02:19:57,082
But

1408
02:19:57,082 --> 02:19:58,082
what a nice thing.

1409
02:19:58,082 --> 02:20:05,402
I want to see the design.

1410
02:20:05,402 --> 02:20:32,342
[TAPE CONTINUES WITH CONVERSATION AND SINGING
THEN:]

1411
02:20:32,342 --> 02:20:38,922
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.

1412
02:20:38,922 --> 02:20:45,512
Now, your suggestion.

1413
02:20:45,512 --> 02:21:57,432
Can

1414
02:21:57,432 --> 02:22:13,042
you bring it?

1415
02:22:13,042 --> 02:22:28,602
All right.

1416
02:22:28,602 --> 02:23:24,342
Will you please go and get it?

1417
02:23:24,342 --> 02:24:02,712
Yes, yes that’s great.

1418
02:24:02,712 --> 02:24:04,452
Just go.

1419
02:24:04,452 --> 02:24:16,872
Those who have their instruments should go
and get it.

1420
02:24:16,872 --> 02:24:29,242
Pat has come I think.

1421
02:24:29,242 --> 02:24:33,772
He is sitting outside.

1422
02:24:33,772 --> 02:24:37,172
What’s the matter?

1423
02:24:37,172 --> 02:24:39,492
What are you doing there?

1424
02:24:39,492 --> 02:24:45,782
Well, you better join our company.

1425
02:24:45,782 --> 02:25:09,612
Take him in the builders.

1426
02:25:09,612 --> 02:25:40,092
[Marathi] Please get your musical instruments
if they are outside.

1427
02:25:40,092 --> 02:25:46,182
The faces of Sahaja Yogis are so different
you know.

1428
02:25:46,182 --> 02:25:49,152
They look so different.

1429
02:25:49,152 --> 02:25:54,382
Every one is a piece of art I think.

1430
02:25:54,382 --> 02:25:57,812
So beautiful.

1431
02:25:57,812 --> 02:26:02,962
What’s she saying?

1432
02:26:02,962 --> 02:26:12,692
Yogi: There’s a new song written by Diane
from Sheffield.

1433
02:26:12,692 --> 02:26:15,302
Shri Mataji: Really?

1434
02:26:15,302 --> 02:26:16,302
Great.

1435
02:26:16,302 --> 02:26:17,922
Let’s hear.

1436
02:26:17,922 --> 02:26:19,122
Now bring it along.

1437
02:26:19,122 --> 02:26:20,292
Yes why not?

1438
02:26:20,292 --> 02:26:24,042
From Sheffield we should have.

1439
02:26:24,042 --> 02:26:51,521
[MARATHI] She’s written a Marathi poem,
so I’ll translate it to you.

1440
02:26:51,521 --> 02:27:21,052
She says that, “My child who is a Sahaja
Yogi is telling you, is manifesting knowledge.

1441
02:27:21,052 --> 02:27:31,261
I request you, everyone, that’s Me, request
you all of you, that I am the mother of this

1442
02:27:31,261 --> 02:27:36,612
child, and you pay attention to him.”

1443
02:27:36,612 --> 02:27:47,832
This is a typical, you see, a Indian, what
we call a kautuk, is the one where you handle

1444
02:27:47,832 --> 02:27:51,562
the child with fondness.

1445
02:27:51,562 --> 02:27:54,812
You express the fondness for the child.

1446
02:27:54,812 --> 02:28:01,442
Now so she’s describing the fondness for
the child, I have.

1447
02:28:01,442 --> 02:28:07,141
My little child sonu they call it, is the
golden child.

1448
02:28:07,141 --> 02:28:29,481
My golden child speaks with such affection,
sweet, what you say to the child’s talk

1449
02:28:29,481 --> 02:28:34,302
– chattel?

1450
02:28:34,302 --> 02:28:35,592
Is it a good word?

1451
02:28:35,592 --> 02:28:41,172
I mean Sahaja Yogis having chattels.

1452
02:28:41,172 --> 02:28:43,782
We can say the beautiful talk of a child.

1453
02:28:43,782 --> 02:28:46,761
You see child here meaning the innocence.

1454
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:56,622
He speaks to you with innocence, and listening
to him, I’m saying, to the people, listening

1455
02:28:56,622 --> 02:29:01,302
to him, your attention will enter inside.

1456
02:29:01,302 --> 02:29:06,601
It will leave all that is outside and will
enter inside.

1457
02:29:06,601 --> 02:29:19,321
And
to tell [MARATHI] Nirupan is the explanation

1458
02:29:19,321 --> 02:29:26,021
of the Divine, but is said, it goes with My
word Niru, Niru is My name.

1459
02:29:26,021 --> 02:29:34,641
So it’s a pun on the word Nirupan – pana
means the abstract of Niru.

1460
02:29:34,641 --> 02:29:36,802
To talk about that.

1461
02:29:36,802 --> 02:29:39,492
So there’s a word, Nirupan has double word.

1462
02:29:39,492 --> 02:29:51,721
It also means to explain the abstract of Mother,
and Nirupana also means explanation of Divine.

1463
02:29:51,721 --> 02:30:00,552
“Oh God, give him the blessings, I say.

1464
02:30:00,552 --> 02:30:10,432
He is also in this world living like a ordinary
householder, as well as he has achieved a

1465
02:30:10,432 --> 02:30:12,472
Sahaja samadhi.

1466
02:30:12,472 --> 02:30:22,932
He has achieved the Sahaja, samadhi as you
know is the enlightened awareness.

1467
02:30:22,932 --> 02:30:27,662
But he lives in the world, not given up anything.

1468
02:30:27,662 --> 02:30:44,941
For the people who are ignorant, he has taken
the help of chaitanya.

1469
02:30:44,941 --> 02:30:57,562
He is [MARATHI] It goes beyond English.

1470
02:30:57,562 --> 02:31:02,781
[MARATHI] Let Me try.

1471
02:31:02,781 --> 02:31:13,722
You

1472
02:31:13,722 --> 02:31:24,432
see you go on conquering, one after another
challenge to the ambrosia of Mother’s talks.

1473
02:31:24,432 --> 02:31:31,071
Take Her name and you can do it.

1474
02:31:31,071 --> 02:31:36,691
It’s very poetic.

1475
02:31:36,691 --> 02:32:03,451
[MARATHI] In the eyes there’s light, enlightened,
and with that all the lights get enlightened,

1476
02:32:03,451 --> 02:32:09,521
and the Siddhapurushas, the ones who have
achieved the Siddhata, the ones who are very

1477
02:32:09,521 --> 02:32:19,592
great, higher souls have come on this Earth
now to see Mahayoga.

1478
02:32:19,592 --> 02:32:20,592
They are watching.

1479
02:32:20,592 --> 02:32:29,122
Their spirits are watching this Mahayoga of
the children, of children that are Mine.

1480
02:32:29,122 --> 02:32:30,122
All right?

1481
02:32:30,122 --> 02:32:31,122
It’s about.

1482
02:32:31,122 --> 02:32:33,172
I am not so good now I must say.

1483
02:32:33,172 --> 02:32:34,352
We’ll have to sit down.

1484
02:32:34,352 --> 02:32:36,462
But Marathi language is very, very deep.

1485
02:32:36,462 --> 02:32:42,861
To bring it out is very difficult but I have
tried.

1486
02:32:42,861 --> 02:33:02,771
[MARATHI] Just put it for her little bit.

1487
02:33:02,771 --> 02:33:20,322
[MARATHI - Poet sings in Marathi.]

1488
02:33:20,322 --> 02:33:40,862
Shri Mataji: Now the last bit I just missed
the point.

1489
02:33:40,862 --> 02:35:00,142
[MARATHI] the eyes lit in eyes of my children,
they’re the eyes you see, there’s a twinkle

1490
02:35:00,142 --> 02:35:37,312
in your eye.

1491
02:35:37,312 --> 02:36:08,812
The light lit in your eyes is that of knowledge,
and when it illumines the [MARATHI] What are

1492
02:36:08,812 --> 02:36:12,941
they called?

1493
02:36:12,941 --> 02:36:17,401
What are called clusters of lights in the
Heavens?

1494
02:36:17,401 --> 02:36:21,201
What do you call them?

1495
02:36:21,201 --> 02:36:22,201
Constellations?

1496
02:36:22,201 --> 02:36:25,002
Yes, yes, constellations, yes.

1497
02:36:25,002 --> 02:36:35,331
And when these lights are enlightened the
constellations, as the great evolved souls

1498
02:36:35,331 --> 02:36:43,161
have come on this earth as constellations
because the twinkle in the eyes they see and

1499
02:36:43,161 --> 02:38:30,972
all of them have come on this Earth to see
the Mahayoga that is working through

1500
02:38:30,972 --> 02:38:33,602
you people.

1501
02:38:33,602 --> 02:38:39,562
That’s a good one.

1502
02:38:39,562 --> 02:38:47,052
Very beautiful.

1503
02:38:47,052 --> 02:38:54,401
Thank-you.

1504
02:38:54,401 --> 02:39:34,241
[Applause]
You read it from there, on the…that’s

1505
02:39:34,241 --> 02:39:35,241
better.

1506
02:39:35,241 --> 02:39:59,952
Yogi: This song’s been written originally
by me but I had a lot of help from brother

1507
02:39:59,952 --> 02:40:15,682
Sahaja Yogis in Sheffield and I need Gareth
Reynolds on the guitar.

1508
02:40:15,682 --> 02:40:36,252
[Yogini sings You are the

1509
02:40:36,252 --> 02:40:37,252
Ocean.]

1510
02:40:37,252 --> 02:40:46,742
Shri Mataji: Well done.

1511
02:40:46,742 --> 02:40:54,992
[Applause] It’s a good one.

1512
02:40:54,992 --> 02:40:55,992
Very beautiful.

1513
02:40:55,992 --> 02:40:57,462
Very good one.

1514
02:40:57,462 --> 02:41:43,052
Very well composed and very well done
and it’s really, I must say, also musically

1515
02:41:43,052 --> 02:41:52,071
it’s very well composed.

1516
02:41:52,071 --> 02:42:07,882
May God bless you.

1517
02:42:07,882 --> 02:42:11,832
Beautiful.

1518
02:42:11,832 --> 02:42:17,502
That’s the quality.

1519
02:42:17,502 --> 02:42:20,842
It’s beautiful.

1520
02:42:20,842 --> 02:42:25,861
That is Sheffield.

1521
02:42:25,861 --> 02:42:31,552
[Applause] Are you going to sing?

1522
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:35,892
You’d better go and eat, and if you want
I can eat also.

1523
02:42:35,892 --> 02:42:37,552
It’s all right.

1524
02:42:37,552 --> 02:42:39,791
So then music comes to a termination.

1525
02:42:39,791 --> 02:42:45,142
I’m sorry, because they have to eat and
I have to go back to London.

1526
02:42:45,142 --> 02:42:51,292
Hope to meet you again sometime, I hope so
before I go to India, I don’t know what

1527
02:42:51,292 --> 02:43:02,382
is the thing but Gavin is trying to arrange
a big program somewhere, again, hoping that

1528
02:43:02,382 --> 02:43:13,682
in London we’ll do better and some people
will have some sticking plasters with them.

1529
02:43:13,682 --> 02:43:14,892
So let’s eat.

1530
02:43:14,892 --> 02:43:17,332
May God bless you.

1531
02:43:17,332 --> 02:43:22,212
What a thing you’ve found I must say.

1532
02:43:22,212 --> 02:43:23,212
That company is the same as the one we saw
is it?

1533
02:43:23,212 --> 02:43:24,212
Same style, is it the same style?

1534
02:43:24,212 --> 02:43:25,212
Similar.

1535
02:43:25,212 --> 02:43:26,212
Ah.

1536
02:43:26,212 --> 02:43:27,212
But they had no guarantee, nothing and no
design.

1537
02:43:27,212 --> 02:43:28,212
This has guarantee?

1538
02:43:28,212 --> 02:43:30,821
It has.

1539
02:43:30,821 --> 02:43:40,932
For how many years?
