1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,590
… that the source of joy is within your
Self.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:15,160
Unless and until you seek your Self you cannot
seek God.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,029
They have all talked about the second birth.

4
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:36,960
What we call the baptism is also the same
where you have to be born again.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,690
Is not just a formal one that is done by unauthorized
people.

6
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:59,830
Even the word “Musalman”, Mohammed Sahib
has again and again talked of a rebirth.

7
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:06,190
You have to find your Self.

8
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,190
How do we find our Selves is the problem.

9
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,190
Is there something like “Self”?

10
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:21,070
Is there really something like “God” or
it’s all a myth?

11
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:36,120
Is there any fact in following the religious
holy life that you get your salvation?

12
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:43,820
So far, we have had no proof of it.

13
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,850
Naturally, in this scientific world today
you have to give the proof of everything to

14
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,720
convince people so that they seek them Selves.

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:08,970
But the science tells us that we were evolved
from a little amoeba to a human being.

16
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,290
Why?

17
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,310
Why God took so much trouble?

18
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,220
If you don’t believe in God you can say
nature.

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:24,470
Why nature worked so hard to create a human
being out of a small little amoeba?

20
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:32,550
Supposing we assemble some screws, and we
try to work out something, a passer-by would

21
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,550
ask, “Why?

22
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,020
What are you going to make out of this instrument?

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,060
What are you doing?”

24
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:55,840
There must be some reason why we have become
human beings after so much of evolution.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,960
But science doesn’t think of “why."

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,090
It just tells you, “This is."

27
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,240
And whatever is not there, it says, “We
can’t explain."

28
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:19,879
The instrument, whatever it is, supposing
has to work on electrical energy or on any

29
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:29,560
energy whatsoever will come into force or
will start working out when it is connected

30
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,099
to the mains.

31
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:43,510
Otherwise it is still in the making process
or you can say it is in transition.

32
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,330
Human being as such is in transition.

33
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,390
It has not found its own meaning.

34
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:02,650
He does not know why he exists, what is the
purpose of his life.

35
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,319
It’s a meaningless life.

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,350
So, you have to be connected to the mains.

37
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:18,061
That’s what everybody has been saying that
you have to be reborn, you have to become

38
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,220
that.

39
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,650
Now, those who talked of this were born on
the tenth storey.

40
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,300
The rest of them are on this earth.

41
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,820
When they talked it all went over their heads.

42
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,330
You have to at least reach the first or second
storey to understand that there is something

43
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,560
beyond this human consciousness, this human
awareness.

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,330
There’s something more to this awareness.

45
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,730
There’s a more opening.

46
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:02,640
There’s a greater dimension which one has
to achieve to understand your own meaning.

47
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,910
About Kundalini all the scriptures, I must
say, have described, all the scriptures without

48
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,910
exception.

49
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:28,030
Of course, in India there has been a very
deep meditation tendency thousands of years

50
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:43,480
back and some of the seers long time back
found out about Kundalini, and even in [Dhirenja

51
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Sangita?]

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Kundalini is described.

53
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,670
That’s as old, I should say, about Vedas.

54
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,280
We cannot say the origin of these books.

55
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,680
Kundalini has been described in them.

56
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,070
Kundalini has been again and again described
and also abused and misused and misrepresented.

57
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,330
All sorts of things have been done about Kundalini.

58
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:19,440
In the Bible Kundalini has been described
in such a manner that it is not called as

59
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,830
Kundalini, but they call it as “Tree of
Fire,” “Tongues of Flames."

60
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,690
Many such adjectives, descriptions are used,
but they have not used the word Kundalini

61
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,400
itself because it is not written in Sanskrit
language.

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,639
So, there must be some mechanism within us
by which we are reborn, no doubt.

63
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,960
There has to be some mechanism.

64
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:58,759
If I’m speaking through this mike to you,
there must be some mechanism which is doing

65
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,000
the job.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,370
In every seed there is a premule, the mechanism
which germinates and creates a big tree out

67
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,440
of it.

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:21,700
In the same way we have a mechanism placed
within us.

69
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,949
But this is a very subtle thing while human
beings are absolutely gross.

70
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:35,460
In this Kali Yuga, modern times, they are
even worse, extremely gross and they cannot

71
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,830
think of something subtle.

72
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,350
If I tell you there is an energy which thinks,
organizes, loves, you cannot think of such

73
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,350
an energy.

74
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,229
But how do we organize?

75
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,520
How do we think?

76
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
How do we love?

77
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,930
From where do we get that energy?

78
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,949
Why shouldn’t we think about it?

79
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:02,530
But as I said that modern man doesn’t think
of “how,” he takes it for granted.

80
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:09,410
So, today I want to tell you about this mechanism
that exists within you.

81
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,210
It should not be just a mental feat with you.

82
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,210
No!

83
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:22,000
It should not be the so-called knowledge of
Kundalini from outside but it’s a happening

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,650
where the Kundalini rises and you get that
whatever is promised in all the scriptures.

85
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:40,560
Today the time has come to prove the existence
of the Divine Power of God all around us.

86
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,490
We have been going and praying to God.

87
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,679
Does He listen to us?

88
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,679
Are we connected to Him?

89
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:55,199
We do namaz, we spread our hands towards God
Almighty, are we connected with Him or we

90
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:58,339
are just doing a mechanical thing?

91
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,839
Even so many people are doing Hatha Yoga.

92
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,759
They think they are doing it in the name of
God.

93
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,449
Is it a correct method?

94
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:11,689
Can we do anything about it?

95
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:20,120
If it is a living process, if it is an evolutionary
process, we must think we have done nothing

96
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,240
for our own evolution so far.

97
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:31,600
From amoeba to this stage we have come without
doing anything about it.

98
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,759
We have taken our human life for granted.

99
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,489
So what can we do about it?

100
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:50,730
If it is a living process, it has to be spontaneous,
it has to work by itself, like a seed which

101
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,800
is planted germinates by itself.

102
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,480
At the most a gardener can pour little water.

103
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:08,569
I can pour the water of My love on your seed
– at the most but the seed has to germinate

104
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,410
by itself spontaneously.

105
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,529
It is a living process and not the mechanical
process.

106
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:18,749
Perhaps we never realize what is a living
process because we take it for granted.

107
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:24,860
You see so many flowers turning into fruits
but we never think how it happens.

108
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,499
We have no idea of spontaneity.

109
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:31,319
We think by doing something we are being spontaneous.

110
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:40,350
So one has to be effortless because Kundalini
is born with you.

111
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,360
‘Sahaja’: ‘born with you’.

112
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,610
‘Saha’ means ‘with’.

113
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,869
Born with you.

114
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:50,129
‘Ja’ means ‘born’.

115
00:10:50,129 --> 00:11:03,959
So awakening is a happening which happens
to you when somebody who is awakened, like

116
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:15,949
an enlightened light or a candle, comes near
other lights which are not yet enlightened

117
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:18,990
and enlightens it spontaneously.

118
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,690
Now you cannot argue it out, you cannot.

119
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:32,360
You cannot rationalize it because rationality
is a limited thing.

120
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,360
You have to go to something that is unlimited.

121
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,420
How can you do it with a limited mind?

122
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,709
This is beyond mind you have to rise.

123
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:50,959
If you argue it out, you are going to be away
from it.

124
00:11:50,959 --> 00:12:02,049
But in science we have found out many things
which indicate, which actually prepares the

125
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:11,790
stage for Sahaja Yoga, which prepares us to
know that there’s something beyond.

126
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:23,529
We have accepted in the medical science that
we have autonomous nervous system which works

127
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:24,699
by itself.

128
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,790
We call it ‘auto’: souayam [somatic-?],
chyme.

129
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,120
Who is this “auto”?

130
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,649
Who is this “one”?

131
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:40,379
The one who beats your heart, the one who
digests your food?

132
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:48,059
When we said that it is done by a system,
you just give it a name.

133
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,989
But how do you explain?

134
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,369
You cannot do it.

135
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:58,939
You may be able to increase the rate of your
heart beat but you cannot decrease it.

136
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:02,410
It happens spontaneously, automatically.

137
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,879
How does it happen?

138
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,089
By giving it a name you do not explain.

139
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:22,439
In psychology people have found out that there
is something like a universal Unconscious.

140
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:30,519
There is that “sarvavyapi achetan” [all-pervasive
action] which gives symbolic suggestions in

141
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,009
the dreams which are universally the same.

142
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:38,019
They’ve accepted this.

143
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:47,600
They have proved it by experiments that there
is a universal unconscious, so many of them.

144
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:55,259
I shouldn’t say all of them because, you
see, after all there will be always a controversy

145
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,999
till you reach the truth.

146
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,120
Human mind must have something to eat.

147
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:09,800
But they have, they talk of it.

148
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:19,269
Scientists cannot explain many things.

149
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:23,329
There is another thing which science cannot
explain is why certain things act differently

150
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,889
in a human body.

151
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,290
For example there are two chemicals known
as adrenaline and acetylcholine.

152
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,129
They have certain chemical reaction.

153
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:37,720
But in the body they react differently.

154
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,199
They cannot explain, they just say the mood
of action of these chemicals in the human

155
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:47,769
body cannot be explained.

156
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,480
Finished.

157
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,949
In the human body or in any body as such whichever
is living, any foreign matter is thrown out.

158
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:11,839
But when a mother conceives a child in the
womb it is not thrown out, but it is nurtured

159
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,350
and looked after.

160
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,869
Who does that?

161
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:21,509
Who understands that this is not a foreign
matter, but is a future child?

162
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:28,649
Is there somebody thinking inside your uterus
or something that is controlling, who takes

163
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,169
the decision?

164
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:40,459
There must be someone or for [you], at least
minimum of a human level who thinks for you?

165
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:53,519
So already there are questions for scientists
to ask and they all can be answered.

166
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:07,490
Because the knowledge of science is analytical,
is in different corners, it gives you part-knowledge.

167
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:15,920
Now Kundalini can be seen, you can see it.

168
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,089
The pulsation of the Kundalini you can see
at least.

169
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:19,089
Many doctors have seen it now.

170
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:21,449
In Delhi of course we don’t have any doctors
so far.

171
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,749
I don’t know if among you there are any
doctors.

172
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:29,339
But you can see with your own eyes the pulsation
of the Kundalini very clearly.

173
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:38,149
If you have a stethoscope you can even feel
it, the rising of the anahata, means the throbbing.

174
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,019
It can be done.

175
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:55,689
But how long are we going to sit asking for
proof of a Kundalini?

176
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,720
Let us now see.

177
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:05,010
As I told you this morning you must accept
this as the hypothesis.

178
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:11,429
Modern times are the worst times for one reason
that you have to explain everything which

179
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:16,339
is a very simple thing as far as religion
is concerned.

180
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,970
As far as other things are concerned you don’t
have to explain, people just accept.

181
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,179
For example, if you have to put on this light
I have to just tell you that you go and switch

182
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:29,179
on.

183
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,830
That’s all, nobody argues.

184
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,870
But today in the morning I told somebody to
put his hands towards Me like this, he started

185
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,000
arguing on this point only, “Why should
I do it?”

186
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,100
Now I said, “I have to tell you the whole
thing, why it is to be done?”

187
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,269
Is a simple gesture he could not do.

188
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:51,200
And he has come here for the Kundalini rising,
you know, with all the rights on Me.

189
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,510
You can’t even put your hands towards Me?

190
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,660
Arguments have brought you nowhere.

191
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,750
You must understand.

192
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,450
This talking “bla, bla” has led you nowhere.

193
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,259
What have you achieved in that?

194
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:12,389
You think you have done this job, built this
building you’ve done.

195
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:16,179
It’s all dead, all dead things, dead converted
into another dead.

196
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,760
What living work have you done so far?

197
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,759
What have you done so far that you can call
as living?

198
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:38,980
You cannot do even a seed sprout!

199
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:46,100
The One who does millions and millions of
such things, billions and billions of these

200
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:55,390
seeds sprouted, when we have to know Him,
at least let us have the humility to know

201
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:03,330
that through your rationality and so-called
intellect you are not going to know Him.

202
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,700
A little drop wants to know the whole of the
ocean!

203
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:13,320
How can you explain to an ant the human civilization
and the human problems, and how can you explain

204
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:23,159
to a human being the working of the subtle,
divine forces.

205
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,210
God has been challenged by man.

206
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,970
See the greatness!

207
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:46,920
That’s why in all the scriptures it is written,
“Humble down yourself in your heart."

208
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,480
That doesn’t mean that you give up your
intellect, doesn’t mean at all, but you

209
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,000
must have the balance of your heart also.

210
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:08,470
So, with all these apologetic words and introduction,
I am now telling you about the Kundalini,

211
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,929
where It exists, because now don’t start
from the very beginning doubting.

212
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:16,539
Please keep your mind open.

213
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:22,250
Later on when you get your realization through
Sahaja Yoga, when you practice it … Now

214
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,029
we have many here who have got it.

215
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:31,360
And they have seen the working of the Kundalini
and have confirmed what I’ve been saying

216
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
about it.

217
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,600
But to you it will be quite shocking.

218
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:45,630
I know it will be because you cannot believe
that such a thing can be inside us.

219
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:51,669
Of course the mechanism has been simplified
because this is just a, I should say, a primary

220
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,820
class, the first standard.

221
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,460
So, it has not been that complicated as it
is.

222
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,080
I’ll try to make it simpler and simpler.

223
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,200
But you must know that it is a subtle thing
which you have not seen yourself, you’ve

224
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,220
not felt it, you’ve not known it so far.

225
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:22,880
It’s something out of the blue for you and
in this so called scientifically enlightened

226
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,279
world it may sound quite foolish to you that
I’m saying these things.

227
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,510
But it is like this.

228
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,909
Do not be fanatic about things.

229
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,399
Even there are scientists who are real fanatics.

230
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:50,600
Science is another obsession which has really
killed their foresight.

231
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,340
Can you see from here?

232
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,020
Now, this is the picture.

233
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,809
As they say man is made in the image of God.

234
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:07,110
We can say now, let us see, ‘Liver’s Tone’
means ‘the Object of which you are the reflection’.

235
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:18,580
So we’ll start from the top.

236
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:32,419
When the child is in the womb of the mother,
the energy which you do not know, the energy

237
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:42,789
that is all pervading called as Chaitanya,
is the divine power of love of God which is

238
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:43,789
all around us.

239
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:47,490
This sounds quite poetic only to people; [for]
many people is just a poetry.

240
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,320
But it is not, it’s a fact.

241
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,000
Because we have never tried this power before,
we only know the power of hatred.

242
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:04,760
So this power of divine love of God which
is all pervading, which is all around us,

243
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,740
descends within us.

244
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:18,261
Yes, it does in the human beings also, when
the child is in the womb of the mother.

245
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:29,880
The brain of the man is evolved in such a
manner that it gets a shape of a prism, of

246
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:39,240
a prism which has got three sides and a base.

247
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:55,159
When this energy enters into the brain, then
it passes into all the surfaces of the brain,

248
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:02,549
and some passes through the center on top
here.

249
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:15,360
You can say not the center but the apex as
shown here.

250
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:23,789
At the back it passes through the brain straight
into the medulla oblongata that is in the

251
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:36,330
spinal chord and forms your central nervous
system, as you call it as C.N.S.

252
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:47,429
On the other side of the brain, left side
of the brain, it comes down this way but when

253
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:55,299
it has to pass through the brain it goes into
the fraction because of different densities

254
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:01,720
and then passes into the medulla oblongata
loosing some of its resultant on the side

255
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,639
into the spinal chord through the medulla
oblongata.

256
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:17,220
Another one which falls on the right hand
side goes to the left hand side through the

257
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
refraction.

258
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,530
Again it looses some of its outside as a resultant,
is divided into two, one going down, and one

259
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:34,309
this way and goes down in the medulla oblongata.

260
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:47,409
The one which falls on the apex of the brain
passes through the center, and part of it,

261
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:54,590
quite a part of it, escapes into the triangular
bone as Kundalini.

262
00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:01,679
This is the arrangement made when you are
born by God.

263
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,690
I call it God because it is so.

264
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,190
Of course, if there is God or not that we’ll
see later on.

265
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:12,120
That proof I have to give you but not just
now.

266
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:21,990
This happens in a very subtle manner because
as I told you, is a subtle energy but is expressed

267
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:31,590
in the gross way in our being as three autonomous
nervous systems.

268
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,670
The central one is known as the parasympathetic
nervous system, is expressed as the parasympathetic

269
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,670
nervous system.

270
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:44,990
There 
are two sympathetic nervous systems, left

271
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,450
and right.

272
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:54,240
But in the subtle form – which Kabira has
described, Kabira has described very clearly

273
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:06,330
– in the subtle form the channels that are
carrying those subtle energies are: in the

274
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:15,460
center the channel is called as Sushumna Nadi,
on the right hand side one channel it is called

275
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:23,259
as the Pingala Nadi and the left hand side
one is called as the Ida Nadi.

276
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:33,549
These are the subtle things which are existing
inside the medulla oblongata, not outside.

277
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,360
So, you see, when the doctor opens the medulla
oblongata the person dies.

278
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,639
How can you see?

279
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,169
How can you see a subtle form of energy through
your eyes?

280
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:47,619
You cannot see even your electricity through
your eyes unless and until there is a lamp

281
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:51,320
which is enlightened.

282
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,909
So, you cannot see those energies which are
at work inside in a subtle form but you can

283
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:02,899
see the expression of it in the gross form
outside.

284
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:27,419
Now these three energies are like the breath
which flows through a flute.

285
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:33,610
The breath that flows through a flute passes
through seven holes.

286
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,929
In the same way there are seven chakras, basically,
main.

287
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,620
When we say seven holes, actually there are
more.

288
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,159
Basically I am saying.

289
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,639
I will tell you about the other ones later
on.

290
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:57,110
Just now I am telling you the, absolutely,
as I told you in the primary, first standard

291
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,110
class.

292
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,830
I am telling you the basic things.

293
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,879
So these chakras, the centers that are placed
within our being which are there, existing

294
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:16,350
there and acting there, and which are in a
subtle form are expressed outside as plexuses

295
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,179
which doctors know.

296
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,100
Is there any doctor in this room?

297
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,220
All right.

298
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,980
They are expressed as plexus and doctors know
about the plexuses because they can see the

299
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,259
plexuses outside.

300
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,499
But what are the centers that are controlled
them?

301
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:39,409
I do not know if the medical science has gone
that far to accept that there are centers

302
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:43,860
inside the medulla oblongata which is controlling
these centers.

303
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,710
I don’t know.

304
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:51,580
I have done medicine for the same reason because
I had to talk to these doctors and scientists

305
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
later on.

306
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
So, I’ve done it.

307
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,950
But at that time it was not so.

308
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,640
Even in My nomenclature, you see, I’ll be
using those old terminologies which I learned

309
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,570
in My young age, and if there’s any difference
you shouldn’t mind because it, you people

310
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:10,700
are changing your nomenclature every now and
then.

311
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:23,559
So, these subtle centers that are placed inside
the medulla oblongata act on the gross plexuses

312
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,360
that are outside.

313
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:33,059
Doctors will accept that much, I know.

314
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,186
They won’t have an objection to that but
little further they will not go.

315
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:40,186
They cannot.

316
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:43,919
They should not as doctors but as Sahaja Yogis
they will.

317
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,929
Once you have the experience and once you
have found out, then why will you say, “No."

318
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:56,830
But one thing we must know that if there is
no microscope how can you see something that

319
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,960
is in a cell??

320
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,619
With these eyes you may not be able to see
something.

321
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:08,679
But supposing you get those eyes which are
microscopic, and if you tell others, they

322
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,840
are not going to believe because they must
also get the microscopic eyes.

323
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:24,929
This is a little problem of Sahaja Yoga that
it has to happen to you, that you could see

324
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,139
all these things what I’m talking about.

325
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:33,669
Now, let us see what are these centers.

326
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:35,580
Now when I describe them you need not get
a fright.

327
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
You need not accept.

328
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,740
Again and again I’m trying to describe that.

329
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,710
You see, with children, it is very difficult.

330
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,850
You have to take them this way, that way.

331
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,419
God knows where their mind will just slip
out.

332
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,500
You see they will find out some loophole somewhere
and just disappear.

333
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,110
So, I have to take your attention properly,
so that you get the sap that you are here

334
00:31:54,110 --> 00:32:03,309
for, that you get what you have within yourself,
you get your own powers so that you know your

335
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:04,309
Self.

336
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:08,950
So, I have to, you see, “child” to you
and look after you and manage you very well,

337
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,749
so that there is no problem.

338
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:19,559
Don’t allow your attention to just capture
you, your mind to take you away, you see,

339
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,940
because your mind will be playing tricks with
you.

340
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,340
So be careful.

341
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:31,470
Of course, you should not also get brainwashed
by what I’m saying.

342
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:41,580
You can judge Me very well whether whatever
I’m saying is correct or not.

343
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Now, the lowest chakra.

344
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,379
This chakra, this center which is a subtle,
again I’m saying, it is a subtle center,

345
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:59,509
is not a gross center, is a subtle center
placed outside the human body and the subtle

346
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:02,379
is not localized at a point.

347
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:13,990
You see, it’s an energy outside the spinal
chord in the prostrate gland, and is known.

348
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:20,549
And now somebody might say that if the prostrate
gland is removed then it exists still but

349
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:21,549
it has…

350
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:24,230
Supposing there’s a chair I’m sitting
on it, I say, ”She’s sitting on the chair."

351
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,399
Now the chair is removed, I’m not removed.

352
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:34,409
Or if the, they say that men have prostrate
glands, so what about the women.

353
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:36,249
You see, like that the questions can come
up.

354
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:38,340
So I’m saying it’s a living subtle center.

355
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,649
So you don’t worry about their chairs.

356
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:47,549
I’m just giving you a little location which
may not be the same for everyone.

357
00:33:47,549 --> 00:34:03,460
And it acts on the pelvic plexus which we
call as Mooladhara Chakra in the Sanskrit

358
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,340
language, because that time there was no English
language.

359
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,629
That doesn’t mean that I’m preaching anything
Hinduism or anything like that.

360
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:12,940
All the saints, I will tell you.

361
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,210
I will also tell you about Christ where He
exists.

362
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,490
I’ll also tell you about Mohammed Sahib
where He exists, about all of them.

363
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,480
So it is no question of one religion or anything.

364
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,389
But these are different things which came
in the evolutionary process of man, and all

365
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:35,280
the evolution that took place in every human
being is within himself, is recorded, and

366
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,440
he’s standing on that.

367
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,589
For example as you come up to first storey
you should know that the whole first storey

368
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,690
is there, second storey, it exists, third
storey, it exists.

369
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:52,270
In the same way all these storeys that you
have climbed in your own evolutionary process

370
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,780
are on these seven steps which I’m telling
you.

371
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:02,099
So, the first step is that of Mooladhara Chakra
which is controlled by a deity, is a symbol.

372
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:18,320
Same from the universal unconscious I’m
telling is a symbol, and this symbol is that

373
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,100
of Shri Ganesha.

374
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,660
This is going to shock everyone.

375
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,890
They are very few, they will have a photograph
of Shri Ganesha, no doubt, but we’ll believe

376
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:34,079
that this is a living symbol that exists within
us on this point.

377
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,970
It does.

378
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,010
What is the proof and everything I will tell
you.

379
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,859
But first now, just now you see for yourself.

380
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:44,829
Is Shri Ganesha.

381
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:51,220
And then if I tell you the same Shri Ganesha
which is a symbol here has incarnated on this

382
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,069
earth as Jesus Christ.

383
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:06,870
He is the symbol of eternal childhood, of
holiness.

384
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:24,600
And as you know that this center controls
the sex also, this symbol suggests that in

385
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:35,930
religion you must have innocence of Shri Ganesh.

386
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:41,760
Those who say that sex can be sublimated,
tantrikas who use sex for sublimation are

387
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,720
the greatest sinners on this earth.

388
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,310
Sex has to be sanctified and holy.

389
00:36:50,310 --> 00:37:00,210
If you do not have a sanctified and holy sex
you cannot get your realization, I’m sorry.

390
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,500
Those who talk of liberation at sex must realize
this: they are ruining their Kundalini completely

391
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,730
because Kundalini is like a mother, Gauri
who is sitting inside them.

392
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:18,650
And for Indians it is very easy to understand
that you cannot have sex with your mother.

393
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:28,540
Those who talk of exciting sex for Realization
are the greatest sinners because this is the

394
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,000
greatest sin.

395
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And those who excite their own ideas about
sex by accepting all these licentious and

396
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,780
permissive things about their sex which is
the holiest of holy are killing their tabernacle.

397
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,660
They are completely finishing off themselves.

398
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,150
There is no saving for such people.

399
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,730
Is going to be very, very hard for them.

400
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:09,000
One has to work very hard for these people.

401
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,980
And if you come to My London center they will
tell you what happens, how difficult it is.

402
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:22,390
One shudders to see how we have played foolishly
with ourselves by experimentations.

403
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,270
Will you experiment yourself with these electrical
appliances?

404
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,990
Let me see anybody who puts their hands into
the oven to experiment!

405
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:37,150
Without holiness you cannot talk of God.

406
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,410
Take it from Me.

407
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,410
You may not like it.

408
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,410
No.

409
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,490
Many won’t like it.

410
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,809
Because their guru must sit down here and
say, “Yes, yes, you must do."

411
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,140
You need a guru also for such a thing, imagine.

412
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:00,010
Human beings as they are they keep a guru
who says, “This is the greatest dharmic

413
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,140
thing you must do."

414
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Imagine.

415
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:11,950
Tomorrow you have to face God remember, even
if you do not get your Realization.

416
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,359
Those who try these tricks are punished in
this life time.

417
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:22,339
They don’t have to take course to any other
life or after death.

418
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:30,770
In this life time, you have to have a sanctified
holy married life.

419
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:38,270
Marriage institutions according to human beings
it is made by human beings.

420
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,470
It is not.

421
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,940
It is made by God.

422
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,290
I’m not here to please you.

423
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:53,300
I have to tell you the fact and the truth
of life.

424
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:01,760
One has to lead a very holy life.

425
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,579
That is the essential part.

426
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:12,200
And I’m very sorry for one thing that Christ
who was the incarnation of that holiness,

427
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:19,700
who is worshipped in those countries is being
insulted completely by those people.

428
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:28,339
He was a celibate person throughout and today
they are making a picture on the sex life

429
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,339
of Christ.

430
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,900
In India is not possible.

431
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,290
Thank God, here it is not possible.

432
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,349
They dare not talk like this, shamelessly
and vulgarly.

433
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:40,770
There is no shame about it in those people.

434
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,690
They have forgotten God.

435
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:53,990
And that’s why when I talk of Shri Ganesha,
you must know that you have to be like a child

436
00:40:53,990 --> 00:41:01,170
when you want to have the blessings of Kundalini
because She’s your mother and She’s all

437
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,530
the time following you.

438
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,039
She’s born again and again within you and
She’s watching you and She’s recording

439
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,920
all that you have been doing.

440
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,730
And who is doing the recording?

441
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:25,190
In the heart you find there is the flicker
of Spirit, of Atma which is the reflection

442
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,560
of God Almighty.

443
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,200
That is the Spirit which records because it
witnesses.

444
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,340
It’s a “sakshi”, it’s a witness whatever
you are doing in life.

445
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:46,660
And is all recorded in the Kundalini, and
at the time of Kundalini awakening She shows.

446
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,910
Many people ask Me, “Mother, how do you
know?”

447
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,190
Because the Kundalini is My part, She tells
Me all that.

448
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,660
And I know about their problems because She
tells Me.

449
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:05,250
It’s all recorded like a tape recorder you
have got the cassette, the spindle, it is

450
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,240
there.

451
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:22,220
And the Kundalini is in the form of Gauri
who is a virgin just married to Shiva.

452
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:30,339
It’s a symbolic expression, is a poetic
expression that She’s sitting and having

453
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:35,900
Her bath before meeting Her Lord.

454
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:44,039
And Shiva is in the heart the Atma.

455
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:50,349
And Ganesha She creates out of Her vibrations.

456
00:42:50,349 --> 00:43:01,020
On Her own being She takes out the mala as
they call it, the dirt, and makes a Ganesha.

457
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:15,520
Ganesha is created by Mother, as Christ was
created by Mother Herself.

458
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:26,840
And She places Him behind the bathroom, you
can say, to safeguard Her lajja, you can say

459
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,950
‘Her chastity’.

460
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:35,280
So, He looks after Her protocol.

461
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,970
Nobody can enter through that side, it is
prohibited.

462
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:53,190
Who can rise to the status of Shri Ganesha
who is beyond all contamination, who is holiness

463
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,190
personified?

464
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,740
He’s like a lotus born out of the mud.

465
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:08,400
We worship Ganesha in the house and we do
all kinds of things with ourselves.

466
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:18,789
We are not bothered about holiness, about
keeping our dignity.

467
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:22,829
How can He be pleased here?

468
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:29,420
But Ganesha doesn’t come in the Kundalini
rising because Kundalini is placed higher.

469
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,849
Already She is placed higher in all of us.

470
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:33,680
We are already sublimated.

471
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,289
So, He’s the only one who sanctions.

472
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:43,210
He’s in charge.

473
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:55,210
Then you find a very white round center which
is called as the Nabhi Chakra.

474
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:59,890
Those who understand Hindi or Marathi or Sanskrit
know what is Nabhi.

475
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:06,540
Is the navel, you can call it the navel Chakra.

476
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,200
Then the Nabhi Chakra is also called as Manipur
Chakra in the Sanskrit language.

477
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
But for our practical purposes name does not
matter.

478
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,430
Is the Nabhi Chakra we can say, everybody
understand what is a nabhi.

479
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:30,349
But it is not here in the nabhi, it is at
the back, in the medulla oblongata it is placed.

480
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:43,060
Now, this Nabhi Chakra or the Manipur Chakra
is the center which controls the solar plexus

481
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,460
in the human beings.

482
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:53,569
This is the center, is the center of dharma,
of religion.

483
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:59,420
When I talk of religion, everybody will say,
“Oh, Mataji believes in religion."

484
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,390
Now, you must understand what is the word
‘dharma’ means.

485
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:10,630
‘Dharma’ means ‘Dharayati sa dharma’,
‘your sustenance’.

486
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,770
Carbon has four valances.

487
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:23,119
Every element has got a different property
that is the dharma of every element.

488
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:31,609
Every animal has got a certain quality, that
is the dharma of an animal.

489
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:39,069
Human beings also have some sustaining qualities.

490
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:40,069
They are human beings.

491
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:47,060
Otherwise they are pischachas or rakshasas
or devils or satanic or they are sub-human.

492
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:53,800
To be a human being minimum of minimum you
must have those ten qualities, ten dharmas

493
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
within yourself.

494
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,140
If you do not have, you are not a human being.

495
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,300
You become satanic.

496
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,900
You become sub-human.

497
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,339
Your awareness goes down, it’s lowered.

498
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:11,220
These are above the ten commandments I should
say, above because there are certain things

499
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,079
which are not mentioned in them clearly, in
the Bible.

500
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:23,630
These are the ten basic qualities in a human
being one should have, and if you do not have

501
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:24,890
then there are problems.

502
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:29,920
For example, we should not shock people – means
drinking.

503
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,359
People say, “What’s wrong in drinking,
Mataji?”

504
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:38,799
Simple thing, it goes against your awareness.

505
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:43,859
See these drinks and all these alcohols they
are not created for drinking at all.

506
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,779
They were created by God no doubt, but for
polishing.

507
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:51,359
You see if you want to polish a diamond, you
have to use gin.

508
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,130
Gin is not meant for drinking, for human consumption.

509
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,250
It is not meant.

510
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:00,839
This is human brain, you know, is such a wonderful
thing that it is using gin for their stomach

511
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,589
which spoils their liver, gives them cancer.

512
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:10,240
And you blame God for all these calamities
of the world.

513
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:16,040
Smoking, now of course, many are saying smoking
causes cancer.

514
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,700
Thank God.

515
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,220
What is tobacco meant for?

516
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,869
Is for insecticide, it’s an insecticide.

517
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,369
I’m telling the truth.

518
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:34,109
But ‘you’ use it for intoxication or what
you call, I don’t know.

519
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:45,430
Now when all the gurus, even Moses, they told
about this.

520
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,390
All the gurus have told.

521
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,890
Incarnations have not but gurus have.

522
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,079
I mean the real ones.

523
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:53,940
I’m not saying these fake ones that are
these days, modern days are just making a

524
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,880
business proposition of everything.

525
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:05,859
I’m not talking about them but the real
ones, who are all born in this void – the

526
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:10,520
void described by the Zen system of religion
– all the ten gurus.

527
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:24,400
We can say the same there again the ten gurus
are incarnated, they tell us about the dharma.

528
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:36,089
The center Nabhi Chakra is governed by the
deity called as Vishnu and His power is Lakshmi.

529
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:46,660
Now, if your Nabhi Chakra is caught whatever
you may try you cannot get the blessings of

530
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,780
Lakshmi.

531
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,910
You cannot get.

532
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:53,690
And even if you have lakshmi it will disappear.

533
00:49:53,690 --> 00:50:00,640
It’s a fact which can be proved.

534
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:09,540
This Nabhi Chakra is controlled by a deity,
Vishnu, which is the sustaining aspect of

535
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,910
God.

536
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:18,980
Vishnu gives the different dharmas to us.

537
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:24,240
That’s how He has evolved us from amoeba
to human beings.

538
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,720
He Himself has incarnated as a leader many
a times.

539
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:38,390
We call it Dashavatara and He has led us through
these incarnations.

540
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:49,400
And His power is Lakshmi, is the Goddess of
welfare they say, or you can call it is wealth.

541
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
It is not.

542
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,140
It’s a very subtle thing, very subtle.

543
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:03,109
That’s a symbol one should understand because
is concerned with us.

544
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:11,770
Lakshmi has got a womanly figure, a mother’s
figure.

545
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,849
She doesn’t have an actresses figure, you
see.

546
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:20,810
They show of actresses and this beauty what
you call ‘beauty contests’, are not good

547
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,470
vibrations at all.

548
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,970
They do not emit any vibrations.

549
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:30,190
On the contrary they emit very dirty vibrations,
I must say, very vulgar, very filthy.

550
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,230
Lakshmi is a mother.

551
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:36,559
She doesn’t use Her body for provocating
expressions.

552
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,559
No.

553
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:38,559
She’s a mother.

554
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:48,560
So, a lakshmipathi, a man who is supposed
to be adorned by a lakshmi, a rich man, should

555
00:51:48,560 --> 00:52:04,710
have the personality of a mother, a one who
is lajjasheela as we call it, who is chaste,

556
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:16,160
who respects the chastity, who is loving,
generous, affectionate like a mother.

557
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,799
Mother tolerates all the nonsense of the people,
of the children.

558
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:30,840
Then in Her two hands She has two beautiful
pink colored lotuses, two flowers of lotuses.

559
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:37,110
The lotus expresses the Shri.

560
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:38,470
‘Shri’ means ‘the grace’.

561
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,890
If I say ‘beauty’, immediately your eyes
will go to those beauty contests.

562
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,349
I do not mean they are not beautiful.

563
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,819
‘Beautiful’ is not a word which these
days means ‘provocating’.

564
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:49,819
No.

565
00:52:49,819 --> 00:53:02,250
Beauty means the complete personality that
emits vibrations, which is a form or is the

566
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:10,930
same as joy and ananda, that we call ananda,
joy and also consciousness.

567
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,339
That is a very complicated thing.

568
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:23,240
So, I would just say that is the form that
emits the vibrations of joy.

569
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:31,410
In Her hands are two lotus flowers which are
pink.

570
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:37,920
Means such a person has to be a warm person,
has to be a cozy personality, and his house

571
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,609
should be as cozy.

572
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:43,359
It should not be all polished and varnished.

573
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:47,660
And if somebody comes in the house, he drops
anything, flowers there, the woman starts

574
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,960
getting angry or the man says, “Oh, you
have dirtied my house.

575
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,910
Will you please clean it."

576
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,950
Such a house is not a home.

577
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,630
It has to be a home for all the people.

578
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:59,690
Such a man is lakshmipathi.

579
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,559
Otherwise morning till evening the fighting
going on between husband and wife, “You

580
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,559
didn’t keep the house clean.

581
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,089
You must clean this and you must sweep that."

582
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:09,680
As if the cleanliness has become the main
part of human life.

583
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,829
I can understand a basic cleanliness should
be there.

584
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:15,581
For Indians we should not tell this because
they lack that completely.

585
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:18,490
They are the other extreme, “Raste me chalet
chalet jaha deko thook dhena ka."

586
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,990
Of course.

587
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,490
But another extreme also is not good that
all the time the divorces are taking place

588
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:33,950
because of cleanliness so fussy that you can’t
live together.

589
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,780
You develop a sort of a mania or sort of … You
become abnormal people.

590
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,460
You suffer from the sickness of cleanliness
morning till evening.

591
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,269
Afraid, “This is to be done, otherwise it
will be dirty."

592
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:47,819
You think ten steps forward march that the
place should not be dirty.

593
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:50,810
Of course it should not be dirty, is a simple
thing.

594
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:55,730
But it should not be that much worked out
that the home becomes a hospital.

595
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,510
Home is a home.

596
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,180
Children must feel it’s a home.

597
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,849
Let them play, let them spoil.

598
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:06,430
In London you’ll be surprised my husband’s
secretary told Me that, “My children were

599
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,710
coming, that aren’t You worried?”

600
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:08,710
I said, “Why?”

601
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,970
She said, “Your house will be all spoiled."

602
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,970
I said, “What?

603
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,440
My children are coming, My grand-children
are coming, I’m looking forward for everything

604
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,609
that I can do for them.

605
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:20,260
How did it come into your head that My house
will be spoiled?”

606
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,260
It can be cleaned.

607
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,510
You have so many ways of cleaning the house.

608
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,369
So the house should be cozy and comfortable.

609
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:36,070
And such a person who is rich is not a lakshmipathi.

610
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:51,010
But a lakshmipathi is a rich person, he receives
people with a big heart.

611
00:55:51,010 --> 00:56:00,650
So the coziness of the lotus should be in
that lakshmi.

612
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:10,400
In another hand, in the two other hands, one
hand has this symbol like this, another is

613
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,279
like this.

614
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:16,839
This suggests that such a man must do “dhan”
[altruism].

615
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,510
Now, in English I don’t know what is the
word for ‘dhana’ because nothing is that

616
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,510
dignified.

617
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,079
‘Dhan’ means ‘giving alms’.

618
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,970
But it is not dignified word.

619
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:35,980
Gavin, what word will you say for ‘dhan’,
tell Me in English?

620
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:43,410
‘Charity’ is also little bit, you see,
‘to be charitable’ means you see, you

621
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:48,550
are higher than the person whom you charity.

622
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:52,190
‘Offering’ if you say then it’s a different
meaning in.

623
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:56,450
But, I would say ‘dhan’ means ‘by which
sharing is expressed’, ‘sharing’.

624
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:00,640
‘Generosity’, you think it’s nearest.

625
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,780
All right.

626
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,849
‘Generosity’.

627
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:08,819
But ‘generosity’, you can say at the most
‘generosity’.

628
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:12,920
But ‘giving your generosity’ you can say.

629
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:26,279
And by this is ashraya, means there should
be people depending on such a person.

630
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:35,980
So, you have to be an enlightened person,
so that people should depend on you.

631
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,619
A rich man has to be a dignified person.

632
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,170
But normally it is not.

633
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:47,800
A rich man first of all he will start dressing
up like a teenager.

634
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,670
He might be the age of sixty years.

635
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,880
You find many like that.

636
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,849
Immediately all his dignity is fallen off,
as soon as [he becomes?].

637
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:02,329
Then he must go to races, he must take to
drinks, he must be found on the street, some

638
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:08,059
policeman must… and it must appear in the
paper.

639
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:15,170
Now, I’ve seen some also horrid things about
women who are rich.

640
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,369
I must say that this happened in England.

641
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,369
But it’s funny, for you people it will be
funny, but it’s common there.

642
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:26,730
A ninety year old woman, rich woman, ninety
year old rich woman having a love affair with

643
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:29,079
a nineteen year old boy.

644
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:31,260
She’s a rich woman, you see.

645
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,750
I mean, I do not know what to call this stupidity.

646
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:40,200
They aren’t rich in India, God save.

647
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,640
No enlightenment of any kind they have.

648
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:53,850
If they had there would have been no problems
at all.

649
00:58:53,850 --> 00:59:01,882
So, this is a symbol of Lakshmi at this stage.

650
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:07,500
The sustaining power is the Lakshmi.

651
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,040
The sustenance, what should be the dharma
and all that.

652
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,730
Now I find if I discuss it will be too much.

653
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:17,849
But I told you for example drinking goes against
the dharma of life.

654
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:27,030
It goes against the dharma of man because
it goes against the awareness of man.

655
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:31,750
If you loose your awareness how are you going
to rise to a higher awareness?

656
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:39,220
Now, people know by drinking these things
happen but they will say, “What does it

657
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:43,210
matter, Mataji, if we drink a little bit for
our society?”

658
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:48,400
And what does it matter if I take a little
poison?

659
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,369
You’ll get used to it.

660
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,200
Gradually you’ll start taking poison.

661
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,790
There are so many people, in this country
specially, if they take a little of tobacco

662
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,960
they feel giddy and fall on the ground, this
tobacco.

663
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,640
There must be some in you also.

664
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,109
They cannot even look at tobacco.

665
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:08,109
There must be some.

666
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:14,920
But there are some who can take tons, tons
inside their being.

667
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,529
How is it?

668
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,579
Both are human beings.

669
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:27,119
So, by little and little, those countries
who have accepted this as a social thing have

670
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,119
done the greatest harm to themselves.

671
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:32,740
Because in the beginning they were taking
only little, little.

672
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:35,349
That was I should say about 100 years back,
you can say about 200 years back.

673
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:38,859
But today if you go and see them, they are
alcoholic.

674
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:41,000
They can’t live without.

675
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:56,599
So the pioneers were the little ones and the
sufferers are those now who are fed up with

676
01:00:56,599 --> 01:00:57,599
alcohols.

677
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,300
Because they think it doesn’t mean intoxicate,
so they have taken to drugs also.

678
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:06,710
And they think it is another experiment.

679
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:13,910
So you have more police force, you do all
kinds of things to control it.

680
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,220
It’s not possible.

681
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,480
Mohamed Sahib has clearly said, “No intoxications.

682
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,059
Nothing, nothing at all."

683
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:29,539
Nanak has said the same.

684
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:32,470
They are both the same people you’ll be
surprised.

685
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:37,180
Same people born at different times, same
people teaching the same thing.

686
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:42,880
Nanak said the same thing, “No smoking,
nothing."

687
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,359
But today there are no Sikhs.

688
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:50,349
In the morning they were, Sikhs are fighting
in London that, “We should not wear the

689
01:01:50,349 --> 01:01:51,349
helmet."

690
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:52,349
Imagine.

691
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:53,349
Where is it written?

692
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:58,329
In which book Nanak Sahib has written this,
“I would like to see, that helmet."

693
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:01,720
On the contrary He said, “Vesh ka kya payda
ka”, “What is the use of changing your

694
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,720
dress?”

695
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,861
And they are fighting on this point.

696
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:10,670
But the way the Sikhs drink in London, I mean
the British are ashamed.

697
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:22,609
I mean they think they are no good compared
to Sikhs, the way they can consume.

698
01:02:22,609 --> 01:02:24,220
And they are fighting in the name of religion.

699
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:31,410
Is a fact I’m telling you that the helmet
they cannot wear because they must have a

700
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:37,220
right and freedom to crack their heads on
a scooter.

701
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,220
What is this?

702
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:48,160
And there is a big procession every, I think
every Sunday they take it out “against protecting."

703
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,470
My head off to all these people.

704
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:52,900
That is what they have done out of Nanak Sahib.

705
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,589
And the Muslims, think of them, they have
written poetry on drinking.

706
01:02:57,589 --> 01:03:06,359
Now, if I say you don’t have to drink, they
will think this lady is talking some of about

707
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:07,460
ten thousand years back.

708
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:14,960
But is a fact I’m telling you, it is not
meant for human consumption at all, none of

709
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,960
these.

710
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,839
Now they might say that Christ was drinking
wine.

711
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,920
Now, ‘wine’ never means ‘alcohol’.

712
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,160
I mean grape juice which is fresh, which is
unfermented is different.

713
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:36,519
But the fermented, even molasses, anything
you can ferment, it becomes an alcohol, which

714
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:37,519
is satanic.

715
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:44,240
Is a process only to be used for polishing
things.

716
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:53,029
You are drinking the polish and all your intestines
all are polished off nicely.

717
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,920
And your liver is ruined.

718
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,289
And then you come to Mataji, “Mataji, our
liver is ruined.

719
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:00,289
Now what to do?

720
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:02,190
How to cure it?”

721
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:05,799
Now, if I tell you, “Don’t drink.

722
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:06,810
It’s very bad."

723
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,880
But these days there are gurus like that you
know, they say, “You drink.

724
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,309
Do whatever you like.

725
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:14,890
Only thing, give your purse please behind
me.

726
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,070
You can do whatever thing, can even smuggle”,
you see.

727
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,450
There was a guru who was teaching smuggling,
actually smuggling to people.

728
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,960
And all the Sehasas [Sikhs] were caught in
Jakarta when they were smuggling.

729
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,799
They lost billions and billions of dollars
there.

730
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:28,650
And when I went to Singapore they came to
Me, “This has happened."

731
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,100
I said, “Now where is your guru?”

732
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,859
“She has gone to Switzerland."

733
01:04:32,859 --> 01:04:33,859
I said, “Very nice."

734
01:04:33,859 --> 01:04:34,859
He said, “You do whatever you like.

735
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:35,859
Bring the purse here, that’s all.

736
01:04:35,859 --> 01:04:37,779
If you cannot look after your wife and children
leave them here also.

737
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:43,390
You sacrifice everything in the name of God
and give everything to me, very nicely.

738
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:44,619
You sacrifice."

739
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:47,559
They are many who will support it.

740
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:50,420
They are not gurus.

741
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,970
If I tell you they are rakshasas, they are
demons.

742
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,720
Otherwise nobody can do like this.

743
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,460
These are demonic things.

744
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,420
They are not afraid of anything.

745
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,640
They have no conscience.

746
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,890
Those who have no conscience are devils, are
devils.

747
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:13,760
They are not afraid of God and they are doing
everything in the name of God.

748
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,010
Tomorrow they have to face God.

749
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,010
No doubt.

750
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,630
But you will have to also face.

751
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:24,450
And when God will ask you, “What have you
been doing?,” then you’ll find that you

752
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:25,450
have no answer.

753
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,130
You’ll say, “I have kept a guru there.

754
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:29,790
I was paying money to him.

755
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:30,790
I was looking after him.

756
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:31,790
He did this much."

757
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:32,790
He says, “What about your Kundalini?

758
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:33,880
What about your awakening?

759
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:34,880
What about your Realization?”

760
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,760
You say, “That I don’t know.

761
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,940
I have kept one guru, you see, and I was paying
him."

762
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:44,190
He said, “All right, where the guru has
gone, you also go there."

763
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,569
And you’ll find the guru settled down very
nicely among the worms in the hell, in the

764
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,170
deepest forest of hell.

765
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,460
Take it from Me.

766
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,279
There is no need even for these people to
die.

767
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:00,779
They will face it in this life time.

768
01:06:00,779 --> 01:06:02,970
All such people have faced.

769
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,160
You have seen what has been the condition
of gurus.

770
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:13,470
So this is the center part of void which has
to look after.

771
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:18,140
And another center that you find there is
the center known as Swadishthan Chakra which

772
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:24,869
creates, which is a creative power within
us.

773
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:32,769
By this center we think, we plan, and also
our bodies cater to.

774
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:38,990
Now, other day only I discovered that doctors
do not know what is the reason for diabetes.

775
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,329
I’m surprised.

776
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,180
I’ll tell them.

777
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,180
You can verify.

778
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,839
It’s very easy.

779
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:48,660
This is the center which does two things:
it thinks, plans.

780
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,480
You know in Delhi everybody’s Swadishtan
Chakra is caught.

781
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,480
Why?

782
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,809
Because too much of planning is going on here.

783
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,040
Everybody’s planning like mad.

784
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:04,160
But there has to be certain balance between
your thinking and between your emotions.

785
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,690
You must have also a little balance.

786
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,670
I don’t know whether doctors think of the
balance of the emotions with this.

787
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,140
They do not.

788
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:12,140
So the diabetes is caused because of this
imbalance.

789
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:20,279
You are all the time using this center for
too much thinking, too much planning.

790
01:07:20,279 --> 01:07:31,380
But the same center looks after the upper
part of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and also

791
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:36,519
the uterus, and also the thinking.

792
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:43,380
So if you are thinking too much you are using
the energy on one side, and there is no way

793
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,450
of filling the petrol back.

794
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:49,279
Then what happens that your spleen suffers.

795
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:57,710
It doesn’t get the energy, and you get the
disease known as diabetes which is only known

796
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:00,640
to the people who think too much.

797
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,359
Is not known to the poor people.

798
01:08:02,359 --> 01:08:03,740
They eat such a lot of sugar.

799
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:05,160
They don’t have to stop sugar.

800
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:10,270
They eat such a lot of carbohydrates and such
a lot of sugar, especially sugar but they

801
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:14,329
do not get diabetes because they do not think
too much.

802
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:17,549
Now thinking has become like a disease with
people.

803
01:08:17,549 --> 01:08:19,640
They cannot stop it also.

804
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,900
It goes like a horn in their head I tell you.

805
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:26,340
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
they go mad and they say, “How to stop it?”

806
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:32,440
It can only be stopped when the Kundalini
rises above this: you go beyond thought.

807
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:41,890
And the thinking creates within us on the
left-hand side of the brain through the Pingala

808
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:47,750
Nadi, through the right side channel, it creates
the ego.

809
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:54,200
Is the ego.

810
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,530
All thinking is done through ego.

811
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:02,390
Those which are developed countries have worked
out their developing through their ego.

812
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:10,820
So, the ego developed so much in that country
that they got fed up of it.

813
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,640
So what has happened?

814
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,820
As a reaction the other side of it started
growing.

815
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:27,220
The younger people there started taking to
drugs, taking to sedatives, which created

816
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,490
in them the superego.

817
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:32,350
The ego gave … Douglas is laughing.

818
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,980
Is a fact.

819
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:36,290
He knows.

820
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:43,840
He’s done it and he has crossed it, and
he has overcome it and he has won it.

821
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,220
So he’s laughing.

822
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:50,380
And the superego has risen now to push back
the ego.

823
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,360
For a Westerner always they say, “Oh.

824
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,060
I’m so bad.

825
01:09:56,060 --> 01:09:57,770
I’m no good.

826
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,040
I’m good for nothing."

827
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,250
Is not humility, is the superego.

828
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,520
Is the superego that is acting.

829
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,080
While in India the ego is rising.

830
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Be careful.

831
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,290
You have to be in balance with ego and superego.

832
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,330
If it is in the center then only I can raise
the Kundalini.

833
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:24,410
If there is an imbalance, I have to remove
the imbalance.

834
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:30,750
And it is removed.

835
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:39,910
The center known as the Swadishthan Chakra,
which also controls the aortic plexus outside,

836
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:48,870
is governed by a deity which we know very
well, is Brahmadeva and His power is Saraswati.

837
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,700
He has incarnated only once on this earth
and you’ll be surprised if I tell you who

838
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,310
was that – is Hazrat Ali.

839
01:10:54,310 --> 01:11:00,040
He was the son-in-law of Mohammed Sahib.

840
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:09,380
Mohammed Sahib is the incarnation of the primordial
master or the Adi Guru who incarnated in the

841
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,850
Void, in the Bhavasagara.

842
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,220
And He’s the same as Nanak.

843
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:17,050
But if I tell this to Muslims, they’ll kill
Me, or the Sikhs will kill Me.

844
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:18,050
One of the two.

845
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:20,250
I don’t know who will come first.

846
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:33,230
I don’t think this time they are going to
crucify but they are not going to like it.

847
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:34,420
They are the same people.

848
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,660
There are ten of them born like that.

849
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:42,110
They are the same people born again and again.

850
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:50,300
And they are the people, if you accept them,
in only one incarnation.

851
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:51,810
They are not going to accept it.

852
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:56,060
You have to accept them in all their incarnations.

853
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,800
I’ll give an example.

854
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,570
There was a doctor who was suffering from
the cancer of stomach, Muslim.

855
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:16,630
He met Me in London and when I told him that,
“You have to worship Dattatreya”, he got

856
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:17,850
a shock of his life.

857
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:21,750
He said, “You mean to say I must give up
my religion?”

858
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,030
I said, “Your religion is in imbalance.

859
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:27,170
He was the same as Mohammed Sahib.

860
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:29,560
Actually Dattatreya incarnated as Mohammed
Sahib."

861
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,950
He said, “I cannot do that.

862
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,360
I only believe in Mohammed Sahib."

863
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:38,020
I said, “All right, I cannot cure your cancer
because cancer is because of imbalance.

864
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,150
It’s too much activity on one side."

865
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,680
Over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system
causes cancer.

866
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,510
You write it down today and you can verify
it.

867
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:48,020
And that’s why when people say I’ve cured
cancer, I have.

868
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,020
No doubt.

869
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,500
Not only Me but even this doctor who is here
he has cured cancer.

870
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,380
Cancer is only curable through the balance
of Sahaja Yoga.

871
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,310
Otherwise it’s not possible.

872
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,310
Take it from Me.

873
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:08,560
So the imbalance of this man, he would not
listen but cancer is a great thing that way.

874
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,660
He had to come back, “All right Mother,
I accept."

875
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,170
I said, “All right.

876
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,621
Now will you pray to Dattatreya?”

877
01:13:15,621 --> 01:13:19,040
A Muslim has to become a Hindu and a Hindu
has to become a Muslim.

878
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:28,460
A Sikh has to become a Muslim and a Muslim
has to become a Sikh.

879
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:34,860
How can you divide God into so many ways?

880
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:39,940
This division is like the atom being split.

881
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,290
You are splitting.

882
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:46,250
You are finding all ways and methods of splitting
each other.

883
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:56,170
And what you are gathering is the volcanic
force of destruction within yourself.

884
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:05,140
So, the so-called drunkards who call themselves
Muslims and the so-called drunkards the Sikhs

885
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:11,260
must know that they are very far away from
the gurus whom they worship as their leader.

886
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:18,050
And as Christ said, “You’ll be calling
Me ‘Christ, Christ’ and I won’t recognize

887
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:21,100
who you are”, it’s going to be that.

888
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:31,170
For cancer you have to have balance of understanding
the complete integrated form of God which

889
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:41,010
has come on this earth, incarnated as different
flowers on the same one tree of life, which

890
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,660
has been at different levels.

891
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:49,470
Like in a tree you have sometimes, first you
have leaves, then you have the flowers, then

892
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:51,390
you have the fruits.

893
01:14:51,390 --> 01:15:01,490
But these are the flowers of the same tree,
have been taken away by different people,

894
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:06,410
just to create problem of dead flowers.

895
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:10,750
They are living on the same living tree of
life.

896
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:20,530
So, I have told you already about one chakra
that is Mooladhara Chakra, the Mooladhara

897
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:21,890
where the Kundalini resides.

898
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:26,430
Then about the Nabhi Chakra from where it
rises to Swadishtana Chakra which moves round

899
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,800
and round and creates the Bhavasagra.

900
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:36,200
I’ve also told you about the Spirit, the
flicker of light that exists in the Heart,

901
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:41,260
which is looked after by Shiva.

902
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:47,600
The flicker of light which is the Sakshi,
which is the Witness, it is like a flicker

903
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,560
that you find in a gas light.

904
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,210
Now the gas itself is not enlightened.

905
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:58,520
The gas itself is the energy but is not enlightened.

906
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,010
The flicker is enlightened.

907
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:05,160
When the gas passes over to the flicker it
also gets enlightened.

908
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,410
That is what is Sahaja Yoga is.

909
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:11,160
That is what is the Kundalini awakening when
it touches that flicker.

910
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:18,140
But the flicker has got the seat on top of
the head here, which is known as the seat

911
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,140
of the Sadashiva.

912
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:26,920
And this is the form or aspect of God which
is existence is.

913
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,380
God Shiva is existence.

914
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:35,480
And this is the first form which emerges into
all these forms, like the seed emerges into

915
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:41,420
the whole tree and becomes the seed, and ultimately
at the dissolution point also, it becomes

916
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,420
Shiva.

917
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:44,800
That is why it is known as Shiva, means the
permanent form.

918
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,770
It doesn’t go into any formations.

919
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,400
It doesn’t incarnate.

920
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,660
It is a witness which watches.

921
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:57,660
That’s the aspect of God.

922
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,830
So, you have got three aspects of God.

923
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:08,160
The first one which is the Shiva, which is
the existence, the second one which is the

924
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:17,310
creator, which is Brahmadeva and the third
one which is Vishnu, which is the sustenance,

925
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:26,710
which evolves, which gives evolutionary movement,
which incarnates, which has incarnated ten

926
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,100
times.

927
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:39,520
Now the chakra above that, you see, in the
center, which we call as Sacred Heart, is

928
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:49,850
in the center, is known as the cardiac center,
you can say “Hridaya Chakra."

929
01:17:49,850 --> 01:18:00,470
You all know what is Hridaya, Hridaya Chakra,
is placed here, behind, in the medulla oblongata,

930
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:04,310
but outside also is the cardiac plexus.

931
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:15,140
Now this center, the cardiac center, is governed
by the deity Jagadamba, the Mother of the

932
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,140
Universe.

933
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:33,160
Parvati, wife of Shiva, the power of Shiva
takes Her place here, to help these struggling

934
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:39,600
evolutionary human beings who are trying to
evolve themselves, to protect them from the

935
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,370
satanic, from the demonic forces.

936
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:49,980
She’s known as Lalita.

937
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,380
She’s known by many names.

938
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,260
They say She has been incarnated 108 times.

939
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,580
She has been incarnated many a times.

940
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:06,100
She has incarnated as an Amsha [from Amshavatarana,
partial incarnation] also, as a part of Her

941
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,240
has also being incarnated.

942
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,050
She is the essence of raksha, is the protection.

943
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:23,880
A person who suffers from insecurity gets
this throbbing here, he gets disturbed.

944
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:32,900
People who suffer from fear have this problem
here.

945
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:35,770
She gives us the protection.

946
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:38,050
She’s the protector.

947
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:47,310
And She’s the Mother of this world, Jagadamba.

948
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:55,330
On the right-hand side of the heart exists,
left-hand side I’ve already told you, right-hand

949
01:19:55,330 --> 01:20:04,320
side exist the symbol of Shri Rama, and His
power is Sita.

950
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:15,700
Shri Rama at an evolutionary stage, came as
a leader on this earth, as an incarnation

951
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,000
of Vishnu, 8th incarnation.

952
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:38,350
And He tried to show the political leadership
of a divine nature.

953
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:43,760
He incarnated on this earth twelve thousand
years back.

954
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,890
And at that time in the whole awareness of
human beings the idea of a leader, as a political

955
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:50,870
leader, was born.

956
01:20:50,870 --> 01:21:04,390
He’s responsible for creating the political
awakening within us, twelve thousand years

957
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:07,480
back, in the human awareness.

958
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:13,680
His power was Sita, His wife, who was a very
simple woman.

959
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,270
But She was the form of Adi Shakti.

960
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:23,400
We know She was because at that time the people
were very sensitive, they could see that.

961
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,900
These days people are not.

962
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,630
They cannot make out a Ravana from Sita.

963
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:35,020
See that is what is the condition of our sensitivity.

964
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:42,950
This is the central force, is known as the
force of Mahalakshmi.

965
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:49,290
So, the Lakshmi is born as Sita for the first
time as a human being.

966
01:21:49,290 --> 01:22:16,510
On the left-hand side force is known as the
force 

967
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,540
of Mahakali.

968
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:37,490
[Shri Mataji talks to an Indian lady]

969
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:47,210
So, the left-hand side power is known as Mahakali’s
power, and the right-hand side known as the

970
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:48,750
Mahasaraswati’s power.

971
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:53,190
Now, the central power is for evolution.

972
01:22:53,190 --> 01:23:00,590
The central power, or you can say the central
ascending column is meant for the evolution

973
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,870
of man.

974
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:06,760
So you are born all of us in the Bhavasagara
state.

975
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:13,620
Now you have to ascend from one to another,
to another, to another.

976
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:19,750
The higher one than that is as I told you,
on the right-hand side is that of Shri Rama

977
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:24,570
and His power is Sita.

978
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:34,660
The complete form of Vishnu came to human
beings six thousand years back as Shri Krishna.

979
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:39,940
That is at this chakra known as Vishuddhi
Chakra.

980
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:44,880
Shri Krishna is the complete form.

981
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,900
Why we say the complete?

982
01:23:47,900 --> 01:24:03,710
Because for Him the whole play, the whole
leela was to be just seen, this whole creation

983
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:07,020
was nothing but just a play created.

984
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:13,220
He had reached that state, and He talked of
it.

985
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:20,400
He said, “Nainam Chianti shastrani, nainam
dahati pavaka”, “You cannot be killed

986
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,890
by any instrument or by anything."

987
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,850
And He did samhara.

988
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:32,240
His greatest quality was that He killed a
many demons on this earth.

989
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,930
Now those who talk of non-violence will say,
“Oh, He was a violent man."

990
01:24:35,930 --> 01:24:54,320
There is a divine method which has to be employed
to kill those demons.

991
01:24:54,320 --> 01:25:00,450
That was needed and He did kill.

992
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:03,130
He was the incarnation of a diplomat.

993
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,330
What is a diplomat?

994
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:14,080
Diplomat is a person who is a sakshi, who
is a witness who plays the divine diplomacy.

995
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,780
He played the divine diplomacy, and you are
still in that diplomacy when you read Gita,

996
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,340
very much.

997
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:26,160
I’ll tell you in two sentences how to understand
His diplomacy in Gita, very necessary.

998
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:38,610
He said in the very beginning, at the very
outset that you seek in within yourself.

999
01:25:38,610 --> 01:25:41,410
He told Arjuna, “You seek in within yourself.

1000
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,740
You have to become a sakshi."

1001
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:50,330
Arjuna being a mediocre, asked Him a question
that, “You are saying that, ‘You must

1002
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:53,990
seek in within yourself, you should become
a sakshi, a witness’ and here you are telling

1003
01:25:53,990 --> 01:26:02,350
me to go on the war, to kill people, kill
my own brothers, kill my own relation!”

1004
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:03,910
What He wanted to say that it’s all a play.

1005
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,560
But it only becomes a play when you become
that witness, when you are Realized.

1006
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,350
That’s what He told him.

1007
01:26:10,350 --> 01:26:14,810
But Arjuna was a mediocre in this respect.

1008
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:22,520
So He being a Father, He understood.

1009
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:28,040
Like a father who comes out of his hut and
see his son beating the cart, so he tells

1010
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:33,590
him, “You bring the horse in front of the
cart then only the cart will going to move

1011
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:34,590
on."

1012
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,980
But the child, the son, doesn’t want to
listen to his father.

1013
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:39,550
He says, “No, I am going to beat the cart."

1014
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:43,890
So, He plays the diplomacy, the Father.

1015
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,890
The Mother does not.

1016
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:45,890
Mother tells you the fact.

1017
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:49,980
So, He played the diplomacy there, divine
diplomacy.

1018
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:57,680
He says, “All right you go on beating but
keep your attention on the horse and you will

1019
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,680
go forward."

1020
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,520
That’s an absurd, absurd thing.

1021
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,720
It cannot happen, you know.

1022
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,530
He told something absurd.

1023
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:12,550
So, He says, “All right, do your karmas
but put it at the feet of the Lord."

1024
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,560
You cannot do it.

1025
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,560
It cannot be done.

1026
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,250
This is something an impossibility because
there is the ego in you.

1027
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:21,930
If you do any work and if you think, “Oh,
I’m putting everything at the feet of the

1028
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:23,600
Lord,” you are just deceiving yourself.

1029
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,970
This is His diplomacy He played it here.

1030
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:25,970
You cannot.

1031
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:31,170
Those who believe in such a thing should know
that it’s a deception.

1032
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,370
It can only happen when you become a hollow
personality.

1033
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,770
For these people now, those who are Realized,
you will see them saying, “It’s going,

1034
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:38,770
it’s coming."

1035
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:42,420
They do not say that, “I’m giving, I’m
doing."

1036
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,820
You have to become a hollow thing like this
which just stands and sees and passes through

1037
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:47,820
it.

1038
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:49,460
The Divine has to flow through you.

1039
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:53,420
And about bhakti, about the devotion, dedication,
is another diplomacy.

1040
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:58,160
You see, His words, you see, nobody sees I’m
surprised.

1041
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:01,300
They have written five hundred books on Gita.

1042
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,442
Nobody has seen this simple point that He
has played a diplomacy with you because you

1043
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:09,820
do not know that you are not beyond ego yet.

1044
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,090
You have to go beyond it to be there.

1045
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,700
(End Part 1)

1046
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:19,180
So, He says about bhakti also, “Pushpam,
palam toyam”, “Whatever you give Me, flower,

1047
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:24,820
this, I will accept but while giving,” – you
know, see the diplomacy, one word He plays

1048
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:27,420
– “in devotion you must do Ananya Bhakti."

1049
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:29,240
See the word ‘ananya’.

1050
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:34,990
‘Ananya’ means ‘when you are not the
other, when you are united, when you are one

1051
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:35,990
with it’.

1052
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,260
When you become one?

1053
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,630
When you are realized!

1054
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:43,420
Everybody will say, “Oh, yes, yes you must
do bhakti, take Krishna’s name, ‘Hare

1055
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,360
Rama, Hare Krishna’, develop a cancer of
the throat."

1056
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,940
Yes, they do, all of them, I tell you.

1057
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,520
So many have come to Me for treatment and
I said, “Now what am I to tell them?”

1058
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,230
Because “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna”, you’ll
get to God?

1059
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,560
Very easy method, you know.

1060
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:12,690
You go on jumping on the Oxford Street, you
dance, wear a dhoti which is falling off,

1061
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:13,690
you get to God?

1062
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:14,690
(Mother is laughing.)

1063
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:15,690
What a stupid idea.

1064
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,690
But there are many.

1065
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:17,690
They are now begging in [Gantura?].

1066
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:18,690
I went there.

1067
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:19,690
They’ve settled down nicely, “Hare Rama,
Hare Krishna.

1068
01:29:19,690 --> 01:29:20,690
Everybody, they came to Me, “Are You an
Indian?”

1069
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:21,690
“Yes,” I said, “by chance I am."

1070
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,690
“Will you buy this book?

1071
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,690
Only give me five annas."

1072
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:24,690
It’s all right.

1073
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:25,690
I will not mind five annas.

1074
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:27,700
I said, “Thank you very much."

1075
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,980
And they are near God?

1076
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:37,190
Begging like poor people, they have no shame,
in the name of God.

1077
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:45,260
Taking His name and begging!

1078
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:53,800
‘You have to do Ananya Bhakti’ means you
have to be a Realized soul.

1079
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:59,500
Now how do you know a person is a Realized
bhakti or not?

1080
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,500
Very easy.

1081
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:07,290
A person who speaks of separation, like Surdas,
he was not a Realized soul.

1082
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:12,160
Those who talk of their tortures, “Oh, God,
when are You going to meet me?”

1083
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,390
they are not realized souls.

1084
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:20,570
But those like Kabir and Nanak, like Christ.

1085
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:23,160
Christ was an incarnation.

1086
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:30,380
But those who talk and sing the praise of
meeting are the people who are realized.

1087
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:35,550
I mean a person who has met God why should
he talk of separation?

1088
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:36,740
Very simple thing.

1089
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:45,000
But we like the songs of the people who talk
of their – you see, I don’t know what

1090
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,430
you call that – who killed himself, who
started calling himself, “Oh Lord, Oh Lord

1091
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:53,040
when are you going to meet me?”, broke his
neck there, he broke his head there.

1092
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:59,500
What is the need to do all this?

1093
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,000
They are fasting.

1094
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,690
Why are you fasting?

1095
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:07,010
I don’t understand.

1096
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:08,950
Why do you want to make your body weak?

1097
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:13,920
In this body, the Lord is going to come, and
this body is fasting?

1098
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:22,660
If fasting people have to get God, at least
thirty percent people of this country should

1099
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,460
get it automatically.

1100
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:27,450
They are made to fast.

1101
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:31,050
Some Yogi: [Hindi]
Shri Mataji: Hum?

1102
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:32,050
Dakare?

1103
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:34,050
Sahaja Yogis: About women?

1104
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,840
Shri Mataji: Women?

1105
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,640
“Santoshi Ma” fast?

1106
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:41,070
Any fast, you know, they’ve gone to such
an absurd limit.

1107
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:43,920
And these Brahmins I will put them responsible.

1108
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:49,440
They have given all wrong ideas, absolutely
just opposition.

1109
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,440
How?

1110
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:59,001
On a Sankashti, the day when Shri Ganesh is
born in the family, see, imagine, that day

1111
01:31:59,001 --> 01:32:00,390
you must fast!

1112
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,030
Imagine the argument behind it.

1113
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,030
That day!

1114
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:06,030
You see, supposing somebody is born in your
family.

1115
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,880
I mean you celebrate it, you are so happy.

1116
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,800
[Us din kush raho, shok rehana chayiye?]

1117
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,960
Supposing I come to your house and you are
fasting.

1118
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,290
I run away the next moment.

1119
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:21,910
[Shir Mataji is laughing]
You see, if you write, “Today we are fasting,”

1120
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:24,950
nobody’s going to come to your house.

1121
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:31,960
If you have to share in fasting, you can do,
like “karva chauth”, they share in fasting.

1122
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,540
You should fast on only one day, definitely
you must.

1123
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,890
That is Naraka Chaturdeshi.

1124
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:37,150
That day they will eat.

1125
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:43,720
Because that day Narakasura was killed and
he was put in the “Naraka”, means the

1126
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,720
Hell.

1127
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:45,770
He was put down there.

1128
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:50,590
And the gates of the Hell were opened for
him, and all such people are put on that day

1129
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:52,030
into the Hell.

1130
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:56,190
So, that day you should not get up early in
the morning, sleep in your bed.

1131
01:32:56,190 --> 01:33:01,470
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear about calendar]
Shri Mataji: See, with the calendar I don’t

1132
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,800
know who has made.

1133
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,480
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: You see, but we must use our

1134
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,480
brains.

1135
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,480
What is Naraka Chaturdeshi meant?

1136
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,250
Actually, these must be some rakshasas, must
be some devils who must have created these

1137
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,250
calendars for us, some of them.

1138
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,250
That you must fast.

1139
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,070
I don’t know who has written such a nonsensical
thing!

1140
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:18,320
The day when the gates of the Narakas are
opened that day, they will get up at four’o

1141
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,250
clock, take their baths and nicely eat.

1142
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:29,940
All the rakshasas will be going with the food
inside the stomach, in the Nabhi Chakra.

1143
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:34,170
The picture has come of- the picture has appeared
of some Santoshi Ma [since 1960, so-called

1144
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:36,520
goddess worshiped by fasting]: everybody fasting
on Friday.

1145
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,840
Then the absurd ideas about “eating food
that makes a difference”.

1146
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,389
Also, this has been introduced.

1147
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:50,140
In Gita also I’m sure there are so many
things which have been brought which are wrong.

1148
01:33:50,140 --> 01:34:02,990
To say that you are born a Brahmin and that
it’s post-natal or pre-natal as they call

1149
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,290
it, prenatal.

1150
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:05,890
And how can that be?

1151
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,040
You just think it over.

1152
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
Use your brains.

1153
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,300
I would say you use your brains.

1154
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:20,570
Vyasa, the author of Gita, author of Gita,
Vyasa, whose son was he, do you know?

1155
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:26,980
He was a son of a fisher woman, illegitimate
son.

1156
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:31,200
You know all of you, of Parashurmuni.

1157
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:40,220
And he’s going to write that you have to
be born as a brahmin?

1158
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:47,550
Those who think that by being born as brahmins
you become brahmins, I must say are sadly

1159
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:48,550
mistaken.

1160
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:58,300
Brahmin means a person who is reborn, who
is a Realized soul, who has known the Brahma.

1161
01:34:58,300 --> 01:35:03,810
It describes a tendency of a person who is
seeking God, is the brahmin cast [unclear],

1162
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:05,220
is a tendency.

1163
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,750
How can Vyasa write like this, you just tell
me?

1164
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:09,110
How can Vyasa write like this?

1165
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:15,360
Now, this is being put on to his head, just
pinned on to him.

1166
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,690
Like the tantrikas.

1167
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:18,920
Oh, God.

1168
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,340
They are the worst of all.

1169
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,380
They have spoiled all our scriptures, they’ve
spoiled all our shilpa shastras, they have

1170
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:26,380
spoiled everything dearly.

1171
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:30,140
The greatest demons that could be born in
this country were the tantrikas.

1172
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,380
They have ruined all the beauties of our scriptures.

1173
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:36,270
Even our aswameda yagna they connected with
sex.

1174
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:42,270
I mean there’s a limit to things!

1175
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:49,790
And that’s why when the people go to Konarak
they think, “Oh, Konarak!

1176
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:53,260
Most enchanting place in the whole country.

1177
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:54,730
Nothing more better than that."

1178
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:55,730
They think, “This Khajuraho!”

1179
01:35:55,730 --> 01:36:01,290
Actually that’s the only aspect which has
spoiled all the beauty of that place.

1180
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:07,860
If they didn’t have that it would have been
much better.

1181
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:14,050
Konarak, of course, the architect himself
was a tantrika.

1182
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:18,590
So, I cannot say anything about such a horrid
fellow he was.

1183
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:27,210
But here the poor architects were given prizes
by these licentious and permissive kings to

1184
01:36:27,210 --> 01:36:39,840
produce the new styles and new types of these
horrible erotic pictures.

1185
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:48,500
There was a competition held and it entered
into our shilpa shastras, into our sculptures.

1186
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,860
It has gone up to the South.

1187
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:51,800
And you’ll be amazed in the South there’s
a temple where they have shown a bad relationship

1188
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,010
between Gauri and Ganesha.

1189
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:55,390
Can you believe it?

1190
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:59,700
And are we to accept it because it was done
by some foolish ancestors of ours?

1191
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:01,890
And everybody says, “Why?

1192
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,530
It’s all right.

1193
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:08,200
In your country also, you see, you have these
things.

1194
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,450
We have seen it, very nice."

1195
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:17,360
And they have written books on kama shastra,
koka shastra, this, that.

1196
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,590
What is the shastra needed for this thing?

1197
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:21,740
I don’t understand.

1198
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:25,200
Do the animals read any shastras for creating
children?

1199
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:34,420
For a simple thing like that why do you have
to read and make so much deliberations?

1200
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,020
Are you gone mad?

1201
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,870
All these artificial things I don’t understand.

1202
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:52,090
For a natural thing, which everyone knows,
why should they go into such things?

1203
01:37:52,090 --> 01:38:03,220
And the result, I’m sorry to say, is seventy
per cent impotency today in America.

1204
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:10,520
Because all artificiality, the spontaneity
is lost, the sanctity is lost.

1205
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:18,430
All kinds of diseases, every third person
is diseased, every third person.

1206
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:19,840
You also are following them.

1207
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,970
After all the sahabs have gone, but now we
are all becoming all sahabs.

1208
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:30,520
The sahabs have come from England wearing
our kurta pyjamas and our sahabs are wearing

1209
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:31,580
ties.

1210
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:34,740
(Mother is laughing.)

1211
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:46,070
Because, you see, somebody told Me that we
used to think,” Where are our lords lost."

1212
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:51,270
They are in India, “Unse kuch sikne ka nahin
hai.

1213
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:52,820
Aap jaan lejeye.

1214
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:55,940
Unse kuch jan-ne ka nahin hai."

1215
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:58,540
Of course dress doesn’t matter.

1216
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:02,900
Whatever you wear it makes no difference.

1217
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:15,110
But main thing is that to know yourself, to
be yourself.

1218
01:39:15,110 --> 01:39:25,430
Is a very, very subtle happening for this
God has placed all these chakras within us.

1219
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:30,370
So, the outside does not matter so much, no
doubt.

1220
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:39,050
But in a way it does, in the sense that when
there is a deeper light, you have to have

1221
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:44,610
the earthen pot all right, you have to have
the proper amount of oil in it, you have to

1222
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,710
have a wick properly put up, and then only
you can enlighten.

1223
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:52,380
If these three things are not all right, then
I cannot enlighten you.

1224
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:57,060
So these three things are also important.

1225
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:02,760
So, your dharma has to be all right.

1226
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:08,060
Of course, I’m not saying that if you are
drinking you cannot get realization.

1227
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:09,060
You can.

1228
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:15,310
And you can also get the power to get over
your habits in no time, because once you get

1229
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:20,160
realized, you get intoxicated by your Self
only, by your own powers.

1230
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:27,240
You can feel in your hand the power flowing
like vibrations, cool vibrations.

1231
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:32,890
If you use them then you will know that you
can cure people with these.

1232
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,880
After some time you can give awakening of
the Kundalini.

1233
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,300
When you will raise your hand the Kundalini
will move in another person.

1234
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,300
There are many now.

1235
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,670
You have got Subramanyam here.

1236
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:42,000
He has cured.

1237
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,290
Gavin, he’s a government servant just like
you, he has given awakening to so many people,

1238
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:50,740
he has given realization to so many people.

1239
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:52,900
You can also do it.

1240
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:58,110
The power exists within you which becomes
intelligible or conscious in your central

1241
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:01,360
nervous system also, and you can feel it flowing.

1242
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,550
You can work it out.

1243
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:09,140
Now, you will know why people have described
in the Kundalini awakening this thing happens,

1244
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:10,140
that thing happens.

1245
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:13,620
If you go from the wrong side, it is going
to happen.

1246
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,460
You have to be an authorized person.

1247
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:22,300
Tomorrow you put your hand in an electrical
appliance and you said, “There is so many

1248
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,300
problem."

1249
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,300
You should not do it.

1250
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,680
Only the engineer can do it, the authorized
person can do it.

1251
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,410
This is all unauthorized.

1252
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:36,150
The first and foremost thing is that such
a person has to be a realized person, and

1253
01:41:36,150 --> 01:41:42,970
not only realized, but has to be a holy person.

1254
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:50,420
Three, four air hostesses are friends of such
and such person, and he is giving Kundalini

1255
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:51,420
awakening.

1256
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:57,650
He’s eloped with his wife, he is smuggling
that side, he is smuggling gold from London,

1257
01:41:57,650 --> 01:42:02,450
he’s bringing down by air, and he is giving
Kundalini rising.

1258
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:06,420
There should be some sense in what people
talk.

1259
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:14,760
This is a very holy happening, has to happen
in the holiest way.

1260
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:21,950
Now, there is another chakra here, where is
My, this red spot is.

1261
01:42:21,950 --> 01:42:23,634
We all put it here but we do not know why
we put it there.

1262
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:31,210
This is the center which is placed where the
crossing of the optic nerves takes place.

1263
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:36,360
You can call it the optic thalamus at that
point, at that point it is placed.

1264
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:43,910
And this center controls the pituitary and
pineal glands, which control, pituitary controls

1265
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:46,650
the ego and the pineal controls the superego.

1266
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:52,400
For a doctor he knows about the pineal and
the pituitary but he does not go further than

1267
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,510
that to know that it controls your ego and
superego.

1268
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:57,050
Even if he knows, he does not know how to
control.

1269
01:42:57,050 --> 01:43:01,760
Now, with Sahaja Yoga, you can see that they
are two balloons in your head.

1270
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,440
You can see them.

1271
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:11,110
It starts from the Vishuddhi Chakra here,
petal, where Shri Krishna reigns, whose power

1272
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,320
is Radha.

1273
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:18,100
And they rise in our head and move like this.

1274
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:28,620
There are two balloons which cover up our
head completely about the age of 12 years

1275
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,520
or so, completely.

1276
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,920
Calcification is complete at that time though
to feeling it is earlier.

1277
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:37,700
And that’s how you develop a separate personality.

1278
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:38,700
You are Mr.

1279
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:40,120
so and so, he’s Mr.

1280
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,120
so and so.

1281
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,120
Is the articulation.

1282
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:48,100
Iit is like a shell of a egg you are made.

1283
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:52,920
You are made like that because you have to
grow inside, inside the shell of your own

1284
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:53,920
being.

1285
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,480
You are a separate…

1286
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,350
(Apart)
You are a shell.

1287
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:02,220
You are a shell, he is a shell.

1288
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:07,840
And you are given the warmth kept there developed.

1289
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:18,550
In the end the egg is broken here, and through
it comes out a new personality, a new person

1290
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:25,280
within which is a very different person from
the one which was before.

1291
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,740
This is Sahaja Yoga.

1292
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:40,760
So, that center which is here placed at the
crossing point of the optic nerves is known

1293
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:46,940
as the Agnya Chakra, and the deity placed
there is Mahavishnu.

1294
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:58,490
I don’t know how far people have read about
Devi or Devi Mahatmya or Markandeya or even

1295
01:44:58,490 --> 01:44:59,510
Adi Shankaracharya.

1296
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:06,060
Now, Mahavishnu is a creation of Radhaji,
is the son of Radha.

1297
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:15,520
She had created Him out of Shri Ganesha’s
essence and in a special way.

1298
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:22,450
And this child was created in the Vaikuntha
stage, in the heaven we can say, and He incarnated

1299
01:45:22,450 --> 01:45:25,740
on this earth as Jesus Christ.

1300
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:31,130
Lord Jesus Christ was not a human being.

1301
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:35,440
He took a form but His body was completely
chaitanya.

1302
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:44,720
He’s a complete, His body also was completely
divine, specially created by His Mother who

1303
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,960
was Mary.

1304
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:49,670
But actually She was Radha Herself.

1305
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:54,840
Sita be-came Radha and then She became Christ’s
Mother.

1306
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:57,340
She is Adi Shakti.

1307
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:02,790
Mary is not an ordinary woman, She is Radha
Herself.

1308
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:10,130
And if you read about Mahavishnu’s birth
you will know that exactly the same is Christ.

1309
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:14,430
The name is Mahavishnu and here it is Christ.

1310
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:17,150
Now, Jesus Christ see.

1311
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:27,000
Jesus, Jesu or Yeshu, this is the name of
Yeshoda, was given by Radha to Her son.

1312
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,170
We say Jesu or Yeshu.

1313
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:33,350
And ‘Christ’ is His surname.

1314
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:36,500
Krishna’s name came from the word ‘krishi’.

1315
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:40,950
‘Krishi’ means ‘agriculture’, is the
man who has sown the seed.

1316
01:46:40,950 --> 01:46:49,310
Krishna came and He has sown the seed of that
awareness by which you can become the sakshi

1317
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:54,310
of this play, the witness of this play.

1318
01:46:54,310 --> 01:47:01,210
And Christ’s name is ‘krist’, is the
same as Krishna’s name.

1319
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:05,240
When He talks of His father, He talks of Shri
Krishna.

1320
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,400
Shri Krishna was His father.

1321
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:11,810
Then He describes Him, all the time of His
father, it is Shri Krishna.

1322
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:17,560
And in the Vaikuntha state it is described
very clearly how Shri Krishna Himself came

1323
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:23,900
to bless Him and told Him that, “You will
be placed even higher than Me because Your

1324
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:28,880
body will be made out of chaitanya."

1325
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:33,330
What is the English word for ‘chaitanya’?

1326
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:34,520
Of consciousness?

1327
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:37,510
But consciousness cannot be chaitanya.

1328
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:38,700
Divine awareness.

1329
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:40,440
Of the divine awareness, you can say.

1330
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:43,910
The divine awareness itself, the divine vibrations
are shown in us.

1331
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:47,090
In the same way, He’s made out of that like
Shri Ganesha is.

1332
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:52,130
Now if He’s so or not, because most of you
are Indians here, you might challenge it.

1333
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,130
You may.

1334
01:47:53,130 --> 01:48:05,740
I can prove it to you because is the same
swastika.

1335
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:17,190
The ayurdas or the weapons of Shri Ganesha
have become “avyakt”, are not expressed,

1336
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:25,340
because He used one weapon for all of them,
is of forgiveness.

1337
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:29,760
And that is the greatest weapon of all, and
that’s why at this stage when the Kundalini

1338
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,690
goes, you have to take His name or you have
to forgive people.

1339
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:38,480
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon that God
has given us.

1340
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:44,830
Now, it is for you to verify whether I say
is correct or not.

1341
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:50,190
But crucifixion is not the message.

1342
01:48:50,190 --> 01:49:04,260
Crucifixion is the explanation of what Krishna
preached that the chaitanya, the divine awareness

1343
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,420
does not vanish, does not.

1344
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:14,390
It is akshaya, it does not get killed.

1345
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,700
You cannot control it.

1346
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:23,680
And this was to be proved in His life through
His resurrection.

1347
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:26,920
The resurrection is the message of Christ.

1348
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:31,395
But as in India you have done all the mess
of all these incarnations, they have done

1349
01:49:31,395 --> 01:49:37,640
the mess of Christ in two ways.

1350
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,940
One, by not respecting the celibacy of life.

1351
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,990
He was a celibate person.

1352
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:44,820
He was a holy person.

1353
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,480
Of course He respected the marriage institution
because He attended the marriage.

1354
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:55,970
You have crucified Him again.

1355
01:49:55,970 --> 01:50:10,730
And secondly which is His power of forgiveness,
complete power of forgiveness.

1356
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:15,650
But they had empires.

1357
01:50:15,650 --> 01:50:26,280
They now want to have the economic controlling
power and all kinds of these things they are

1358
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:32,460
doing under the name of political, I don’t
know what they call it.

1359
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:43,270
They have to be Christians, all that was against
Him is now done today.

1360
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,360
As we Indians have done all that what was
against Hinduism.

1361
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:53,780
When Shankaracharya himself has told, “Na
Yogena Sankena”, still we are having Hatha

1362
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:54,780
Yoga.

1363
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,970
Now we are going to have Hatha Yoga in the
college.

1364
01:50:55,970 --> 01:51:01,700
Patanjal Shastra, himself Patanjali has said
not to have Hatha Yoga for the married people,

1365
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:02,850
for the householders.

1366
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:07,190
It is meant for very few who go to the jungles,
stay with their gurus.

1367
01:51:07,190 --> 01:51:11,290
Every tikalpa, every person is having here
Hatha Yoga.

1368
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:14,910
Now, this boy today he was suffering because
of Hatha Yoga.

1369
01:51:14,910 --> 01:51:16,550
Of course, I’ve stopped it.

1370
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:17,550
But still.

1371
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,980
You’ll have heart troubles, you’ll have
everything.

1372
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:22,180
Now you teach your students here in the … And
let them to have sex also.

1373
01:51:22,180 --> 01:51:26,530
In the West very nice, Hatha Yoga is very
good because everybody wants to become an

1374
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,530
actress.

1375
01:51:27,530 --> 01:51:32,730
Hatha Yoga is not meant for us, for the householders.

1376
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:35,950
It is meant for these standing-on-the-heads
type.

1377
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:40,090
Let them go and break their necks there.

1378
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:41,700
One will get after thousands of years.

1379
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,590
It has been said by many, those who are realized.

1380
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:45,920
Now, I know them.

1381
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,490
They are sitting on the hills.

1382
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:52,000
They have told My disciples also that, “We
have taken thousands of years to get this

1383
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,750
and Mataji is just giving you like that."

1384
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:57,810
It is!

1385
01:51:57,810 --> 01:52:08,090
In the same way so called Christians have
done all that was necessary to kill the image

1386
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:09,920
of Christ.

1387
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:18,610
It’s rather surprising but I think the opposites
are attracted.

1388
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:24,840
The drunkards will become the disciples of
Mohamed Sahib, all the licentious will become

1389
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:32,290
the disciples of Christ and all the, that
we call in Sanskrit ‘Dravidic Pranay Pranayn’,

1390
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:33,800
will become the Hindus.

1391
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,540
That’s how it is.

1392
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:37,090
Just the opposite.

1393
01:52:37,090 --> 01:52:49,640
The last is the center of Sahasrara with one
thousand petals, is the limbic area which

1394
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:55,040
is surrounded by one thousand petals of [inaudible].

1395
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,470
In the Bible it is said, “I will appear
before you like tongues of flames."

1396
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:02,840
It is like tongues of flames, living tongues
of blue flames and white flames and crystal

1397
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,470
flames, and they are very silent flames.

1398
01:53:05,470 --> 01:53:08,710
You can see that.

1399
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:13,590
Some of you have seen it.

1400
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:16,080
And they are like the – they act on our
nerves.

1401
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,570
Now the doctors will argue that there are
982 nerves.

1402
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:23,300
Yes, there was argument on that also, 982
nerves, and eight motor nerves and these nerves,

1403
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,910
and all of them do not become one thousand.

1404
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:27,460
I mean that’s not the thing.

1405
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:29,360
I’ve not counted them.

1406
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,480
One thousand they are, no doubt.

1407
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:45,820
So, these one thousand petals are the one
thousand hands, imagine, in your brain.

1408
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:56,860
And this is the Kingdom of God inside which
is the limbic area.

1409
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:03,330
When ‘you’ cross this door of Agnya, you
enter into that and this is ruled by the Adi

1410
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:09,070
Shakti, by the Primordial Mother, and She
opens it out.

1411
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:14,490
She does it, it is Her job.

1412
01:54:14,490 --> 01:54:23,420
At the end of it, is the gate or the hole
known as the Brahmarandra on top here which

1413
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:30,800
presses the ego and the superego on both the
sides and takes your attention into that all

1414
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:38,610
pervading Power which is all pervading.

1415
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:43,890
When the Kundalini crosses the Agnya, you
become thoughtlessly aware.

1416
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:50,920
Thoughtlessly aware means you are aware but
there is no thought, you become silent.

1417
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:56,650
When It crosses the Brahmarandra then the
vibrations start flowing through you and you

1418
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:57,650
get cool vibrations.

1419
01:54:57,650 --> 01:55:00,420
This morning about five, six people got it.

1420
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:03,490
Of course, we have many here who are Realized
people.

1421
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:09,380
All these people who have come from the West
are Realized people.

1422
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:11,560
And they have experimented and they know all
about it.

1423
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:15,250
And there are many others who have come from
Bombay and those from Delhi also, we have

1424
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:19,290
many who are Realized, who have those vibrations
flowing through them.

1425
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:22,130
It happens.

1426
01:55:22,130 --> 01:55:23,890
It has to happen to you all.

1427
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:27,730
You all should get it.

1428
01:55:27,730 --> 01:55:28,730
Then what happens?

1429
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:31,400
By that you become collectively conscious.

1430
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,690
I said, “You become."

1431
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:34,610
I did not say that, “You have to become."

1432
01:55:34,610 --> 01:55:35,610
You become.

1433
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:36,880
You get that awareness.

1434
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,630
Immediately you start feeling the vibrations
of other people.

1435
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:42,970
That little girl, Pragnya, who came here,
she’s a born Realized.

1436
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:45,400
There are many children who are born Realized.

1437
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:50,920
My two grand-children in Bombay, they are
grand-daughters, and they are both Self-realized.

1438
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:53,550
The younger one is hardly ten months and she
knows all about Kundalini.

1439
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:55,980
You ask her, “What is caught?”

1440
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,090
You see, you can feel it on the fingers.

1441
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:01,400
Now, there’s a book which one of My disciples
has written – I should say My son or My

1442
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,050
child has written – it’s in Marathi.

1443
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:04,050
So far Hindi?

1444
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,160
[Mai nahin huya aaj tak-?].

1445
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,740
No, nothing has been done in Hindi.

1446
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,770
English also they have published one of My
lectures.

1447
01:56:08,770 --> 01:56:13,650
But, in this Marathi book we have given the
indications on what things you can feel the

1448
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:14,650
chakras.

1449
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:20,850
You can feel the centers which are caught
in your fingers here and you can see.

1450
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:26,130
And that’s how as a by-product you cure
people, that’s how the diagnosis comes through

1451
01:56:26,130 --> 01:56:28,700
and you can feel it.

1452
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:34,040
It’s tomorrow morning we are going to have
meditation starting exactly at 8.30.

1453
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:37,900
I would request you tonight to go sleep off.

1454
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:43,380
Early in the morning clean yourself and come
here at 8.30 so that we finish the session

1455
01:56:43,380 --> 01:56:45,300
for you to go to your work.

1456
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:50,860
8.30 early in the morning you have to come
here, and then the Kundalini rising and everything

1457
01:56:50,860 --> 01:56:51,920
can be done.

1458
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,010
Because people are more interested in the
lecture, what am I to do?

1459
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:59,690
So, I’m not doing any awakening today because
it’s already very late for you.

1460
01:56:59,690 --> 01:57:05,960
Now if some of you want to have it, I can
work it out.

1461
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:09,590
(Short dialogue with Sahaja Yogis.)

1462
01:57:09,590 --> 01:57:26,440
Word ‘Realization’ means ‘when you separate
your Self from your gross awareness and become

1463
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:27,440
the subtle being’, is the realization.

1464
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,090
That’s the beginning.

1465
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:35,650
In that first stage, I’m going to tell you
tomorrow evening all about it, how in different

1466
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:37,430
three stages it works out.

1467
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:42,270
The first stage is of nirvichar where you
become thoughtlessly aware and collectively

1468
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:43,990
conscious through your vibrations.

1469
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:52,160
Then in the second stage you become nirvikalpa
in which you start giving realization to others.

1470
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:59,570
And the third stage is a complete Self-realization
where you become completely the master of

1471
01:57:59,570 --> 01:58:04,980
Kundalini of others and your own, and you
can work it out and also sitting down here

1472
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:13,590
you can feel the Kundalini of all the people
all over the world, and also you can control

1473
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:23,260
many elements and events.
