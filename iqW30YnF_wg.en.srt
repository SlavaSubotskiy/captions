1
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I thank you very much, all of you, for coming
over for a small meeting that we are going

2
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:16,800
to have and, it's very important for you people
who are responsible in life to understand

3
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,800
what is the work of Sahaja Yoga and how important
it is. I mean, now we have people all over

4
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:33,909
the world, it's working in 85 countries. In
a country like Benin we have twenty thousand

5
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,800
sahaja yogis.
All this is...why? Because people are trying

6
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:51,209
to find the truth, they are not satisfied
with whatever they know. They want to know

7
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:58,209
what is beyond and I started this work long
time back. I think I have worked in England

8
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:09,209
for at least 25 years. But, unfortunately,
England is nowhere compared to other countries.

9
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,919
Even Austria has ten times more people, Austria
and Germany. What's the reason? I think the

10
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:29,599
newspapers. Your newspapers are not responsible,
they are not at all responsible. Some may

11
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,880
be, I am not saying all of them.
But the newspapers that I have seen here,

12
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,380
they never come and ask me anything, they
never try to find out if there's anything

13
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:48,970
I'm doing that is good for people, which is
essential, which has to be worked out. But

14
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,970
somehow they take the very negative side.
This is the main reason why people are lagging

15
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:04,170
behind in knowing the truth. I'm sorry to
say that. I have written in my book also that

16
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:15,060
you have to be more responsible.
Actually newspapers are now even more important

17
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:22,060
than any political party or any, I should
say, kingdom or anything. They have achieved

18
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,279
that power by their sense, by their honesty,
by their steadfastness, their sense of honour.

19
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:36,230
I must say that we got our freedom in India
because the newspapers of England. They are

20
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:43,230
the ones who wrote the truth about us. They
are the ones who told how atrocities were

21
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,850
worked out on India. It's only they who have
really helped us.

22
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,670
I mean I cannot understand what has happened
to today's newspapers as they are. Specially

23
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:02,670
I am meaning the newspaper that I have seen,
which is absolutely nonsensical (reference

24
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,190
to 'The Independent' newspaper which had recently
published a negative and incorrect article).

25
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,190
It is talking about money. Doesn't talk about
what good it (Sahaja Yoga) has done. Now I

26
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:19,430
must tell you I have not taken a single pie
in England. Never! It is only when they came

27
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,620
to India they had to pay for their stay there.
They had to pay, also, in Italy for their

28
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:36,699
stay there. And whatever remains I used to
use. I have used my money for 20 years. Last

29
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,839
10 years since my husband is retired I'm using
this money. The houses that I have are all

30
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,129
of my money. Imagine these people, they should
have come and asked me before doing. It's

31
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:59,129
criminal to be like that. The problem now
in England is that they have developed a great

32
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:08,189
sense of criticism. Just criticise! Now we
have critics of the critics in this country.

33
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,889
But whom are you criticising?

34
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,889
Nobody is creating anything. Have you got
those old writers of England who were respected?

35
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:28,430
Have you got that level of novelist that existed?
Is there any, any person who can write like

36
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:46,310
those great writers? I have read them and
I know. I have great respect for them but

37
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:56,319
were they just the lotuses in a pond, who
were so great. They are the ones who established

38
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:05,689
democracy here. They are the ones who brought
such beautiful ideas to the whole world and

39
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:15,149
what are we doing now? What are we spreading?
All kind of malignant stuff.

40
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,050
I have never studied English in my school
because my father was a freedom fighter and

41
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,199
he said "No, you have to go into an Indian
school" Afterwards, also, I never studied

42
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:35,199
because I was a medical student. But only
reading these things we Indians still respect

43
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:45,389
you. Because of their intelligence, because
of their clear headedness and also the [sense

44
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,540
of] justice they had. That's all missing nowadays
in the intellectual people. I was surprised

45
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:58,749
to read in this newspaper all non-sensical
things, given by one boy who is just a teacher,

46
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:05,749
while Sahaja Yoga is working in 85 countries
and we have scholars and we have great writers,

47
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,279
all sorts of things we have here, and here
one boy, who is just a teacher somewhere...I

48
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:21,449
am sure he doesn't do it on his own. How can
he afford?

49
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:28,449
There are only six people who are working
against us. We could have really put them

50
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:36,939
into jail but we didn't want to. Because they
did something very wrong. Sahaja Yoga is a

51
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,560
very moral society and if they are immoral
we don't want them there. That's all! That's

52
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:52,509
the freedom we have. That's the independence
we have that we don't want to have immoral

53
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:59,509
people living in Sahaja Yoga. What's wrong
in that? We believe in morality and without

54
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:07,699
morality our countries cannot improve. It's
very surprising. They had some IQ. I used

55
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,120
to think they'll have some, also, some heart
but doesn't seem so. And after that now there

56
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,699
is also SQ, is the 'spiritual coefficience',
which you can achieve in Sahaja Yoga.

57
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:35,699
You don't know what heights you can go to.
But having such stupid things, by one man

58
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:42,930
coming and telling you something. And how
cunning it was that it was just done before

59
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,199
my program. Why? Why are they doing it? What
is the advantage? What are people going to

60
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:55,199
gain by that? First time I'm saying this.
I should have said this much earlier I think.

61
00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:03,089
What is the achievement? Why do you write
all those things which are nonsensical? Which

62
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,199
are false. Absolutely false. Why? Is that
racialism? what is it? I can't find out. I

63
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:23,490
can't find out the reason why these people
are listening to one man who is just a teacher

64
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,730
somewhere and writing all falsehood.
We can pull them in the court no doubt, but

65
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:37,779
we don't want to, because it's an open thing.
If you want your Self-realisation we are here

66
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:46,399
to give you. There's no force on anybody,
there's no compulsion on anybody. On the contrary

67
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:53,730
we are anxious to throw away so many from
Sahaja Yoga! There's a code of conduct, no

68
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:03,430
doubt.
We have marriages which are very legal and

69
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,600
at the most 1% fail. We are very loving couples,
beautiful children and a very beautiful society.

70
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:24,249
One has to understand that you don't have
that. You have to get to it. What do you have

71
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:33,499
to sacrifice? Nothing. It's absolutely free.
My lectures are free. Self-realisation is

72
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:40,499
free. Now what else? We should offer them,
I think, some tea also free then it would

73
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,420
be better! That's, I mean, I don't know why
in England where we had such great people

74
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,420
right from Shakespeare. Think of them. I can't
understand.

75
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,629
Shakespeare I call him an avadhuta, means
a person who was beyond and was trying to

76
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:09,629
show all kinds of human enterprises as failures.
Just to show that to make them detached. Such

77
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,110
a great sage like him was born in this country
of yours. But if there are false gurus that's

78
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,459
the best! If somebody tells you lies is the
best!

79
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,459
What is the matter? Where are people going?
In a way it's good that I saw this article.

80
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,860
And all falsehood! About Hitler what I have
said I've brought the book. What I've said

81
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:50,860
was that...you can read it out. It's very
interesting to see what I have said it. Can

82
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:58,299
you?
Also today I saw very nice article in the

83
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:09,760
magazine they gave 'Culture' that what do
we owe to Germans and Beethoven, because of

84
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,020
him and all that. Such a beautiful article.
But who will read that? I think better read

85
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,480
it out so that it's cleared out! My memory's
very good, that's the trouble!

86
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,240
Derek Lee: "So there was a reference in the
recent article in 'The Independent' which

87
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Shri Mataji is now talking about to Her supposed
attitude towards Hitler and towards the Jewish

88
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,480
people. So this is just a quotation from the
book

89
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,029
'Now to all the critics of Hitler he looks
like an idiotic foolish and maniacal type

90
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:54,429
of a person. Actually if you listen to any
ego-oriented person or see him, you'll definitely

91
00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,230
witness the idiocy of his talk or his behaviour
very clearly. Of course, if you are not ego-oriented

92
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,850
yourself. If you are an ego-oriented person
then you will protest against him saying that

93
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,000
he's trying to assert his ego. An egoist can
always find the ego of another person very

94
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,490
easily but if you are a person who is afraid
and frightened of egoists you will either

95
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,710
accept his value system or accept the tyranny
and subjugation of such a tyrant. An evolved

96
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,309
soul would witness the babbling of an idiot
and may get into an enjoyment of humour at

97
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:32,590
this stupid drama. Hitler's ideas impressed
none of these two types, but he captured the

98
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,730
minds of a third kind, which was innocent,
simple, raw and absolutely immature. The young

99
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,899
teenagers whom he groomed for years. For these
people killing became a great natural enjoyment.

100
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,250
In the olden days people used to go to forests
to kill animals, especially tigers, and as

101
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:56,250
a result the tiger became a man-eater or attacked
human beings and this killing had to be accepted.

102
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,870
Even when eating the flesh of animals when
sufficient food was not available was quite

103
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,240
justified. Most of the people who went to
the forest for hunting did it just for the

104
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,880
pleasure of killing. This horrible desire
can lead to a very dangerous ending. The horrendous

105
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:18,880
war in Germany broke out against the Jews
who had to die in gas chambers because' they

106
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,210
were very greedy and cruel' and according
to Hitler they had killed Christ. There were

107
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,950
so many ways in which one could have controlled
these greedy people....

108
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,950
....And so it goes on. It's a criticism of
Hitler and of Nazism"

109
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:43,809
Shri Mataji: I mean how can I support Hitler?
It shows a complete ignorance of Truth. How

110
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:52,909
can you write such things in England which
is not a country where all the barbaric people

111
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:07,549
live? What has upset me is that I have worked
the most in England. Days together. Day in

112
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,820
and day out. Now I'm 76 years of age and I've
been working but really people give up. But

113
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:27,929
compared to these newspapers, in the smaller
places they're very honest, because they wrote

114
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,220
about me how I cured people, how I helped
boys and all that. (a reference to a miracle

115
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,330
in Northampton in 1982 in which a boy is saved
by Shri Mataji after a fall even though She

116
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,490
was actually in a Public meeting at the time.
That miracle was published in the Local Northampton

117
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,740
newspaper). But they (The Independent) have
nothing else to write but this, that I take

118
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:42,740
money! I do say that I don't take money for
Self-realisation. Because it doesn't understand

119
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:59,190
money. Your Kundalini is your Mother, She
doesn't understand money, how can you take

120
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:06,190
money for Her? Is a fact.
But if you come to Italy and live there five

121
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,580
days you want to do it freely everything to
give freely? Is it? Now we have made hospitals,

122
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:22,260
I mean, thousand and one things. List hai
na? (Do you have the list?) No? He's not brought

123
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,399
the list. But I mean so many things we have
made. Orphanage we have made for prostitute

124
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:37,730
women, for destitute women. So many things
we are making on the social level. At least

125
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,279
twenty things in India.
Then in America I bought a land. Hundred and

126
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,289
forty acres of land. Americans are much more
sensible I must tell you. They don't have

127
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:56,289
this kind of a mental attitude that whatever
is written (in a paper) is law, no. They will

128
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:05,090
judge it. Otherwise how will you take to Truth?
How will you know the Truth?

129
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:12,899
My worry is the country which I think is the
heart of the universe. I regard it as a great

130
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,080
country, while what's happening to the modern
people? Where are they going? You should have

131
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:35,380
been leaders actually, in Sahaja Yoga. I personally
think that way. You are all educated. You

132
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,380
are known for your education and you are known
for your understanding and here what do you

133
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:53,299
find? How are they lured by falsehood.
The problem now is another one, that, by doing

134
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,700
all this, they will reduce the number of people
who can get Realisation. They will reduce

135
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:12,820
the number of people who would know the Truth,
who will create a society of peace and joy

136
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:23,519
and love. This is what they are doing. They
don't understand their responsibility and

137
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:31,649
they'll drag the whole country into..I don't
know. It's a moral sense you should have to

138
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:43,929
understand that what have you been doing so
far and what are we to do? Where our children

139
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,860
will go? What will happen to them? They are
taking to drugs.In Sahaja Yoga you just give

140
00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:01,010
up drugs. So many. In England itself there
were seven people who came for [Realisation],

141
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:08,269
all drug addicts, all first class [now]. Doing
very well. Doing very good jobs. Drug addiction

142
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:15,350
we can reduce in no time. In Italy I might
start a 
hospital for drug addicts. Possible in Italy,

143
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,980
not in England. Not possible. The English
will come there and get there! Can you imagine?

144
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Why this level has come down? If you have
read Pickwick Papers you know how he has described

145
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,820
in the democracy that time. Is that the same
democracy is coming now? For me England is

146
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:57,419
the same as India, because there are nice
human beings and good human beings, learned

147
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:04,419
ones. For me it makes no difference. And it's
important that you all should get your Self-realisation.

148
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:19,049
There are so many English here sitting. How
much money have they given me?

149
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,500
This is a very pivotal point that on such
a small thing like that the whole country

150
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:36,169
should be destroyed. Why didn't they come
and ask me? Every time there's one fellow

151
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:49,789
comes up. Maybe he's paid by someone. There's
hardly six people, I know all of them. And

152
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:56,940
I know why they are doing it because we have
thrown them out of Sahaja Yoga. In no other

153
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,940
organisation people are thrown out, no other.
Because they are wrong, they are doing wrong

154
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:16,720
things, immoral things.
And such people should form such a good group

155
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,720
for your newspapers here? The newspapers that
used to publish such things about Warren Hastings

156
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:33,360
(British Governor-General of Bengal, from
1772 to 1785) and all that, and gave us independence,

157
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,360
they are the ones. They are the ones who fought
for the right, fought for the truth, not afraid

158
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:52,090
of anything. I mean, I think the newspapers
are at such a pivotal position that they can

159
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:03,460
kill the nation or can save the nation. I
can't understand still. What is the purpose?

160
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:16,789
The purpose is to dissuade people.
Don't you all want to know the truth about

161
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:29,169
your Self? You don't want to know? Let it
be. You are free. If you want to know you

162
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:40,509
can know. I cannot force. It cannot be forced.
It has to be your will, free will. It has

163
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:52,450
to be your will otherwise it won't work out.
If you try to say that "Alright, raise my

164
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Kundalini!!" I cannot, I cannot.
You must have that pure desire to become the

165
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Spirit. If you don't have, I cannot, nobody
can raise, it's a fact. Because other desires

166
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,350
are never satiable as you know. That's the
principle of economics. There's only one desire

167
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:31,130
which is satiable is that you have to become
the Spirit, and that you have to become the

168
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:38,130
Spirit, is said by all the religions and all
the saints. I'm not the only one who has said.

169
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:49,220
Even if you say Tao, or any other such things,
they say the same thing, that, you have to

170
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:56,669
become your Self you have to know your Self.
'Know thyself'. Now how do you do it? Is it

171
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:11,139
not important to know your Self? If not, alright!
But if it is, then try to get it.

172
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,039
Now they told me your all very responsible
people have come here. And all of them have

173
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:30,220
read the newspaper and all. To me, I can't
believe it. Because you are all educated people.

174
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:43,549
You read every day the news and you know the
calamities what are following. What's going

175
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,360
to happen to this world? Think of it. With
hatred with killings. What is going to happen?

176
00:30:54,149 --> 00:31:01,149
What is the destiny of human beings? Yesterday
I spoke about that. What is the destiny? Just

177
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:11,039
to make some money if you put some controversial
thing (in the paper) it's being very irresponsible.

178
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,299
This is what they told me that, they want
to know about the newspaper and this and that,

179
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:25,779
so I had to tell, but to be very frank, it's
nothing important. We are on the verge of

180
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:32,509
jumping over with the last breakthrough of
our evolution and there is this Kundalini.

181
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:39,509
No credit should be given to me. It's your
Kundalini, your pure desire and if it is awakened

182
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,830
and if you get your Realisation then first
you feel cool breeze in your hands. Mohammed

183
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:57,830
Sahib has said that, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak and they tell you what

184
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,129
centres you are catching".

185
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:08,129
All this knowledge was known to some people
but was never imparted to any, or to very

186
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:16,190
few. Only one Guru used to give Realisation
to one person. And whatever you read in Tao

187
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,049
seems to be something out of the blue, how
can that be? A saint described there is a

188
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:29,049
very different type of person. Now, how to
become a sage was not told. Though in the

189
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:41,779
Tao system they have said there is a mysterious
female energy within you. Respect the Mother.

190
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:51,460
But they didn't say who is this Mother, what
is this, what is her job.

191
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:58,460
That way I must say, despite all that, that
Indians are very much near it, because the

192
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:10,909
whole culture builds that up. We have also
very bad influences of very bad things, but

193
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:20,370
still, those Indians who have come to England
are not very near this, I must say. But those

194
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:30,639
who are in India, I don't know why, by changing
the land or whatever it is, very few Indians

195
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,710
in Sahaja Yoga in England. Why? What is the
reason? They'll go to some babaji who'll give

196
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:52,299
them a story, that's all, finished, in the
morning. Why are they not seeking their Self-realisation?

197
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Only in England! Only in England! What's the
matter? It's difficult to understand. We have

198
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,679
tried. Sahaja Yogis have tried. They have
given up. Why? What's the matter with Indians

199
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,460
when they come here? I think they have become
very money-oriented. Whatever it is. I mean,

200
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:39,310
in India also there are money oriented people.
I don't know.

201
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:52,990
According to Indians, the thing that one has
to achieve is Self-realisation. In life that

202
00:34:53,220 --> 00:35:00,220
is the most important thing. That's their
tradition that's their education. How they

203
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:15,170
are contaminated I don't know. It's surprising.
So what is it that works that way? This is

204
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,910
your country and you should be proud of this
country. You have given freedom to so many

205
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:30,910
countries. You have done so much of good work
and so many blessings are there upon you.

206
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:41,570
But be careful now. If you miss the point,
you will miss it.

207
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,350
Yesterday I told (at the Royal Albert Hall)
what is the destiny of humanity. You see every

208
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:59,750
day wars going, fighting going on, killing
going on. There's everywhere racialism or

209
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:06,750
anything else. Under the name of religion.
Anything! How human beings have become so

210
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:16,620
much perverted God alone knows. But now the
time has come to find your way and help the

211
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,370
whole world to come around. You can help the
whole world, you can be leaders of the whole

212
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:33,370
world, but what I find that nobody takes the
challenge.

213
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:42,020
Now the positive side of Sahaja Yoga I need
not tell you. You get cured, you also get

214
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:51,990
materially alright, I mean all kinds of things
there are. You become a nice person, sweet

215
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:00,980
balanced, happy and you give happiness to
others. We have marriages, we have children

216
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:12,420
who are beautiful. Our families are beautiful.
One in a million of course they divorce or

217
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:20,490
do anything, is allowed. Nobody is forced.
But we have legal marriages. First they are

218
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:32,850
married and then they are registered. Not
illegal, we will not have. As you have here

219
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,120
we don't have. We don't allow other nonsense
like homosexuality, marriage between men to

220
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:50,270
men and all that -- is absurd!!
They all give up, all give up all these habits

221
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:57,270
that's the best part of it. Once your Kundalini
rises they all give up all these bad habits.

222
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:05,340
All this perverted things which are very shocking
and surprising. And they get cured of many

223
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,320
diseases. Hospital they said "You have to
pay" I mean how can you have a hospital [free]?

224
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:20,370
The building I built but you can't live anywhere
free. And for one bed they charge £4. We

225
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:27,760
have five doctors working there now. And for
a room which is air-conditioned, where your

226
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,760
family can stay, which has an attached bath
and all that they charge only £12. Is it

227
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:43,420
too much? Even in India they charge much more.
I mean we can't go on giving free things from

228
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:55,050
where are we going to do that? But as they
say "cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap". Cheap it

229
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,520
is. It's written. Nobody sees the point. The
reason is you are lost in the whirlwind of

230
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:18,780
criticism. This is the curse, I don't know
why is this the curse in England. Italy, imagine,

231
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:27,270
where Pope lives we have at least ten times
more or twenty times more people there. They

232
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:34,620
are curing people, they are giving Realisation,
they are going in the villages, working it

233
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:46,740
out. But there must be some curse, I must
say, that you don't see the point. You have

234
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:57,260
to be satisfied about yourself. You should
know that you don't know the Truth. This is

235
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:04,510
a very subtle Pure Knowledge of a very correct,
to the point.

236
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:11,530
Now we have so many doctors, ask them. They
have cured people and they have seen how people

237
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:18,530
are cured and they all have this knowledge,
what is the problem is, what a person suffers

238
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:34,990
from. I don't know. It's very difficult, I
feel sorry. Every time they ask me Mother

239
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
please come, I come, alright. They are so
anxious I should come, alright, I come, but

240
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:51,180
every time? Last time also we had a meeting
like this. How many come out of it? Two or

241
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:04,250
three. It's just a function you know, go to
some party or something like that!! You have

242
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:16,260
to respect yourself. you have to honour yourself
that you are human beings, highest of evolution,

243
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:26,790
and that you have to have your Realisation,
you have to have. Why not? Africans are having,

244
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:34,180
why can't you have? It's your due, it's your
birthright I say. To take your Realisation

245
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:46,380
is your birthright, but you must respect yourself.
If there's no respect how can I do it?

246
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I am sorry I had to say this because they
told me that they are all more anxious to

247
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:08,940
know about this newspaper. I said 'Alright'.
What good this newspaper has done so far?

248
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Tell me what has it done? You want to do good
to yourself or no? If you want to do it, you

249
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:38,550
are welcome, I am here, if you don't want
to do it, you are free. We are independent

250
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:48,120
people and we understand the value of your
independence. Some things they screw up, tell

251
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:56,420
you. How can you believe these people? All
this comes because, maybe, they want to make

252
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:12,490
money. I can't see why. Now you are all intelligent,
educated people, you think it over, you think

253
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:26,370
it over, what wrong am I doing? Alright, you
can ask me questions.

254
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,880
Question: "Many of your followers meditate
in front of a photograph of you. Some possibly

255
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:14,510
regard you as a deity and seem to worship
you. Should they regard you as a deity and

256
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:31,380
do you so regard yourself? And I ask the question
as a Christian believer."

257
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,550
Shri Mataji: "I'm also born Protestant Christian,
and I know Christians where are they."

258
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:42,700
Derek Lee: "He's asking about the photograph
Shri Mataji, that, sahaja yogis meditate in

259
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,140
front of the photograph and asks whether we
consider you to be a divine personality and

260
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,690
whether you are a divine personality. He's
very direct person Shri Mataji."

261
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:00,690
Shri Mataji: "It's like confession (laughter).
It is very difficult to be born in those days

262
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:24,360
and talk about spirituality, very difficult,
but has to be done in these horrible days

263
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,480
only. And only I think I was capable, Christ
would have been crucified much earlier but

264
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:45,140
I have sustained myself. Photograph, who has
said you should not have, Christ never said

265
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,680
that. Did he? It helps, photograph does help,
what can I do? It helps a lot, it has helped

266
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:14,830
so many. All of them will tell you their experiences
about the photograph. I didn't allow them,

267
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:24,130
but they found it themselves and they told
me 'Mother, your photograph is very helpful'.

268
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:31,190
There are so many miracles that every time
I get so many letters. So I asked one gentleman,

269
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:42,060
he's a scientist, that you compile them. So
after a month he says 'Mother, now the letters

270
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:50,210
have come over my head and here also, this
side and I think you better see yourself and

271
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:57,390
tell me which one to write!' You see for yourself
how it works. It is, you see, it is something,

272
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:11,950
no doubt. There are prophecies about it, all
over. But to understand it first you get your

273
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:28,330
Realisation. Without that you cannot. What
is another objection? Have you shown them

274
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,340
miraculous photographs? "
Derek Lee: "We showed them in the Albert Hall

275
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,410
yesterday, not tonight."
Shri Mataji: "Now what are these miraculous

276
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:47,410
ones. We have not made them, nothing. How
do you see those lights, how do you explain,

277
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:57,050
all around me? I've told them now that Quanta
Theory is that. Let some physicist come round.

278
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:09,020
There are two physicists from Russia and one
from Brazil, they are writing about it. It's

279
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:41,270
the Quantum Theory, that will explain. When
I said something, anything about it, there

280
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:07,250
are doctors they can research it and find
out. Is the Quantum Theory. Unless and until

281
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:25,450
you have an open mind you cannot see things.
(Derek Lee talks about miracle photos on boat

282
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:51,100
in Italy in Sorrento.)
First of all one has to know that problems

283
00:49:55,270 --> 00:50:02,270
are created by religion. Why? Why should any
religion create a problem? Because of our

284
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,480
reactions to the Truth! And Christianity,
because I was born as a Christian, I found

285
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:21,990
out the reason, what is the reason, why it
has happened. If you come to sahaja yoga you

286
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,530
will know.

287
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:32,530
Another thing, it's a myth that Christ made
alcohol in that wedding. It's a myth. The

288
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:44,630
myth is that He went there and He made water
into alcohol. No! It was grape juice. Now

289
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:57,120
think about it, can you make any wine spontaneously?
It has to rot and rot and rot and the more

290
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:09,660
it rots is better. Is a fact. I asked somebody
about English, why is it? They said "Mother,

291
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:19,040
they drink a lot". The best house in a village
is always a pub! You go to any place, [if]

292
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:38,410
you want to find out about somebody, ask in
the pub! Better than police station they will

293
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:46,650
tell you "This man lives there, this man lives
there" -- very politely!

294
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:55,030
Drinking is so much here, baapare baap, in
my book I've written down a little bit. Actually,

295
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:05,270
one of my husband's friends, very good man,
he died. So he said "You should come" [to

296
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:11,750
the funeral], I said "I would love to come".
But he said "Must have a full black dress".

297
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:18,250
"But I don't have full black dress". You have
to have a formal dress for the dead body,

298
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:25,250
can you imagine! I was so upset and I said
"I am not coming." Then he went there and

299
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,240
he described the whole thing. When he came
back he was so sick. He said "First they had

300
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,240
a lunch before going to the cemetery", can
you imagine? And then they said "Now to go

301
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:46,510
for dinner back". Everybody anxious to go
to the dinner. Nobody cried or wept or anything.

302
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Only thing you had to wear a black dress!
It shows no emotional attachment! If somebody

303
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:05,180
dies, it's so heartfelt. Nobody! I 
was so shocked and he was very upset because
a friend had died. They said, "What's the

304
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:16,530
matter are you not well?" They couldn't understand!
There's no relationship of love. As soon as

305
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:29,320
they die they will jump to find out who has
got what in the property.

306
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:37,850
Our neighbour was there, he died [and] for
one month, nobody knew he was dead there.

307
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:45,780
He was alone, poor thing. He was alone and
he was an old man and nobody knew. Then, I

308
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,490
don't know, something, but they said this
had smell or something like that, and the

309
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:03,490
man who was taking milk to him saw the milk
bottles one after another but he never enquired.

310
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:11,560
He said, "I thought he's gone on a holiday"
The house was open. This is our feelings are

311
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,010
not good.
This is a country which I call is the heart

312
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:29,010
of the universe. And also your newspapers
circulate all over. In one of my miraculous

313
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:42,290
photographs they were singing [the song] "Sitting
in the heart of the universe" and heart, heart

314
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:49,290
like that [appeared]. Just like the doctors
draw. Many hearts came in. Just imagine! The

315
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:03,490
proof. But they are heartless people. No feelings
for your own father, for your own mother,

316
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,260
for your own people. I can understand Americans
who are only 200 year old, this thing, but

317
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:19,260
you are one of the oldest people. Yes doctor?
Brian Wells: "Shri Mataji at the Albert Hall

318
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:45,090
last night many people experienced a powerful
experience they felt vibrations on their hand

319
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,080
they felt cool air coming from their heads.
Could you say something about why they seem

320
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:08,080
to ignore this, why do they not understand
that there is something very powerful going

321
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:16,590
on here"
Shri Mataji: "I can ask you the same question!

322
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,880
I don't know. They talk of baptism and for
that they'll spend so much money, everything,

323
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:35,680
but they don't realise their own baptism.
I don't know where are they lost. And every

324
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
one of them raised [their] hand (to say that
they had felt it), every one of them! You

325
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:54,170
are a different calibre doctor. I don't know
what to say. I don't know. What should we

326
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:10,680
do to awaken people to reality? What should
we do? Now as this gentleman says he's a Christian.

327
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:25,820
There are so many Christians, what do they
do? Go to church? The mayor in Cabella where

328
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,830
I live, he asked me 'Mother what do you do
to these people?' I said 'I do nothing.' He

329
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:40,700
said 'They are sitting with you for nine hours,
what are you telling them? What are you talking?

330
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:47,010
What's happening? While' he said 'I go to
church after 15 minutes I start seeing the

331
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:54,010
watch and after 30 minutes I run away'. You
must get your Self-realisation. Christ has

332
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:06,680
said 'Know thy Self'. That's the criteria.
Alright? Once you know your Self you'll know

333
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:18,760
everything. If you don't know your Self where
are you?

334
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:29,670
I am here to prove about Christ and about
all the great incarnations. How they were

335
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:40,470
one. And to give you that Spirit which enlightens
your mind. That's what you deserve. That's

336
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:57,520
what you should have. Not only reading Bible
but reading your Self."

337
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:04,520
(Somebody in the audience says he's coming
for the first time but his wife has done Sahaja

338
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:46,970
Yoga for 2 years and he sees that it has done
her nothing but good)

339
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:57,070
Shri Mataji: " That's the point. You have
to have transformation. There are many who

340
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:01,880
will say this. And you now come to Cabella
and see for yourself. " (applause)

341
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,280
Yogini's husband: "Is that a personal invitation?"
(laughing)

342
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:12,280
Shri Mataji: "Actually, you see, it's rather
spartan to be in Cabella because I bought

343
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:23,920
lots of lands there, but one thing bad about
this authority in Cabella there, they don't

344
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,520
give you a permission to build. So it's going
on and on and on still that permit for me

345
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:35,770
to build something for Sahaja Yogis. Though
I have bought one house, but this is little

346
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:42,770
spartan but people enjoy. In a camp they enjoy
very much. India is not that difficult. Italy

347
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:52,440
it is. And the government goes on changing
you see. So one government gives you permission

348
01:00:54,670 --> 01:01:01,670
another says 'no'. But you will enjoy, come
along!"

349
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:09,940
Question: "I was reading somewhere that we
are not human beings having a spiritual experience

350
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:32,550
but we are spiritual beings having a human
experience have you any comments on that?"

351
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:39,130
Shri Mataji: "Of course. Of course you are.
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

352
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:46,130
you are the Spirit. That's what you have to
be! And once you become the Spirit you will

353
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:55,190
know your powers. You become just loving angels.
Very good idea!"

354
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:24,740
Question: "I follow the Christian faith and
I'd like to ask you what difference you see

355
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:55,670
if any difference at all between your experience
and the laying on of hands by the elders as

356
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:04,290
said in the gospel of St.James, chapter 5.
Perhaps you could give us your views on that

357
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,380
please."
Shri Mataji: "I haven't seen anything like

358
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:13,900
that happening. In Sahaja yoga so many things
happen I must say. I mean I am myself surprised

359
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:20,900
when they tell me how people are cured. The
other day only, in Italy, there was one fellow

360
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:28,480
who used to play ...what instrument is that?"
Sahaja Yogi: "Double bass"

361
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,940
Shri Mataji: "Ha! And he, when he came on
the stage, you see, they told me 'Mother you

362
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:39,940
have saved his life'. I said 'How?' So, his
heart was open for an operation and the doctors

363
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:49,090
gave up saying that his aortic vein is missing
and they closed the heart and they said he

364
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:59,400
will die. And he just saw my hand he says,
when he slept he saw my hand. When he was

365
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:08,830
in a slumber I think. And then he opened his
eyes, still he saw my hand. And he got cured,

366
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,300
completely cured. So many things have happened.
Actually I also don't know my own powers,

367
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:26,300
it has become like that. So many things like
that. This 

368
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:14,030
is one I'm telling because it's recently.
It happens.

369
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:55,890
...Finished? Should we have Realisation now?
There's one fellow standing there he's writing

370
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:41,620
who is he?"
Journalist: "I spoke to your organiser, I'm

371
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:55,620
from the Daily Mirror"
Shri Mataji: "Ah, nice you have come, I'm

372
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:11,120
very happy. I hope you all understand your
responsibility as newspaper people. Very important.

373
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:27,810
They don't realise what powers they have.
They don't realise. Now they are better but,

374
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:40,839
first time in India, we had some people from
the newspaper and they openly told me, 'Do

375
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:51,029
you want one column? So you'll have to call
us to one restaurant there and give us a nice

376
01:08:53,170 --> 01:09:00,170
treat. If you want two columns, then you have
to give a complete dinner.' (laughter) I was

377
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:11,130
looking at them, I said 'Sorry, I don't want
to have even a word from you but thank you'.

378
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:18,130
But now they have improved. They have improved
because some very important people in India

379
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:30,679
are supportive of Sahaja Yoga. Very important.
So it has improved. They don't do all this.

380
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:41,929
I think, now better have our Realisation,
is the best. That's your own. That you should

381
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:50,089
have. Just put your hands to me"
