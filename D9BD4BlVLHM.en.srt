1
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,166
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:51,917
But the truth has two sides:

3
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:59,417
the illusion that we see can look like truth,

4
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:08,250
and the essence of the illusion also may appear to be truth.

5
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,333
But the other side is absolute

6
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,625
and has to be felt,

7
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:29,041
has to be experienced

8
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,041
on your central nervous system.

9
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,542
It's not a mental projection that we can think of,

10
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,000
nor emotional imagination,

11
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:55,792
but truth is what it is, it cannot be changed.

12
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:02,999
It cannot compromise.

13
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,917
We have to humble down ourselves to know the truth.

14
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:19,250
Now we have discovered so many things in the science,

15
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:28,709
by humility that we have not known so far.

16
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:38,291
But whatever is known outside, like the tree must have roots,

17
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:47,834
and these roots are not known

18
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:52,458
if you are just looking at the tree.

19
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,709
And when somebody talks about the roots,

20
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:00,999
we get shaken up

21
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:04,583
because we have had no knowledge of it before.

22
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,792
Thus we are conditioned to only see the tree,

23
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:19,125
and we cannot make our mind understand

24
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:22,291
that there must be some roots to it.

25
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,291
So we can say

26
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:34,291
that people have advanced in science quite a lot,

27
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:38,250
and have progressed and have become developed countries.

28
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:41,709
But they do not know, if they do not seek their roots

29
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:45,041
they will be completely destroyed.

30
00:44:56,834 --> 00:44:58,667
Now when I'm before you,

31
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:04,500
one should not in any way feel that I'm here to offend you,

32
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:16,500
but I've come here to tell you about the roots,

33
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,750
the great properties you have within yourself.

34
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:32,125
We know about so many energies around us like electricity,

35
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:36,500
gravity, in the scientific field of knowledge.

36
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,834
But there are subtler energies within us

37
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,750
which we should try to understand

38
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:50,375
with the same humility of a scientist,

39
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,709
and the open-mindedness.

40
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,500
Now what problems are facing us here in the West,

41
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,083
we should try to understand.

42
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,750
As somebody in America asked Me, "What's wrong with the West?"

43
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:26,041
We have to see what has happened to us in our evolution.

44
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,999
When we evolved through the industrial development,

45
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,709
we developed certain temperaments and certain value system.

46
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:51,250
Industrialization was a good idea,

47
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,917
but there is no discretion where to stop it.

48
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,375
And that's how when we go to very industrialized countries

49
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,834
we think we are just eating chemicals and not food.

50
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,583
Now the balance has to be maintained,

51
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,375
but how?

52
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,375
By knowing about the roots.

53
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,041
Now the first problem I feel about the Western mind

54
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,917
is that it is a mental being;

55
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:48,750
it has developed this mental capacity beyond balance.

56
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,709
Like in the industries we have to have new things

57
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:57,959
made all the time;

58
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,875
every time we have to sell some goods

59
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,542
we must have new fashions,

60
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:05,333
otherwise the machines will be starving.

61
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,083
In the same way our brain starts producing new things,

62
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,583
that's how these things are man-made.

63
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:47,291
With mental projection we start thinking

64
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,291
of all the time new things

65
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,250
and we appreciate whatever comes new to us.

66
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,625
We have to take to new things,

67
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:06,709
but not to something that is absolutely devoid

68
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,375
of any traditional value.

69
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,959
Like the other day I said that

70
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,625
"What's so special about Freud,

71
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,000
why did you accept him and why not Jung?"

72
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:40,250
The reason was given that he gave us very new ideas.

73
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,709
Anything new is not always good;

74
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,667
for example plastic was new once upon a time,

75
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you know what are the results of plastic development.

76
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:05,250
If that is true about matter, what about the spirit?

77
00:50:09,999 --> 00:50:12,333
So when we seek also the truth,

78
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:16,375
we try to get to a new method all the time.

79
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,291
And I think the evil

80
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:30,333
that came in forms of wrong type of gurus

81
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,709
are the product of this kind of demand.

82
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,667
Only seventy to hundred years back, I should say, in India,

83
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:59,583
suddenly a new wave of some new ideas

84
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:02,917
about the knowledge of the roots started.

85
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:14,709
Some things that they talk of are not written in the Vedas

86
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:21,375
nor in the Puranas, nor in any books of oriental knowledge;

87
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:35,875
nor in any books that are written after Christ

88
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:41,125
like the Bible, or Koran after Mohammed Sahib,

89
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,125
and also the writings of Zoroaster.

90
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,458
It has no relationship whatsoever

91
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,959
to the ancient findings about the roots.

92
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:14,125
So we had a problem about the religion in the same manner.

93
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,709
For example, let us take Christianity:

94
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:30,625
Christ came on this Earth, as you will know later on,

95
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:34,834
to create a special awareness within us of the spirit.

96
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,542
He resides inside within us

97
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:54,417
in a special center, what we call the Agnya Chakra,

98
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:04,291
and described in the Indian scriptures as Mahavishnu.

99
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,917
And in the purest form

100
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,959
He exists as the Omkara, as the Logos.

101
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,291
So much is described about Him in the West,

102
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,250
in the Western knowledge

103
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:28,959
in the mental way,

104
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,583
but actually it is very much discovered

105
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,458
in the Indian philosophy.

106
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:55,250
You cannot understand Christ by mental projection,

107
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,834
because He is beyond mind.

108
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:08,000
He has Himself said, "You are to be born again."

109
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:17,458
When Nicodemus said, "What do you mean â€˜to be born again'?

110
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:20,291
Am I to enter into the womb of my mother?"

111
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,667
"No," He said, "whatever is born of flesh is flesh,

112
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,542
and you are to be born of the Holy Ghost."

113
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,750
And what is the Holy Ghost?

114
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:50,125
The bishop of Canterbury was asked this question,

115
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,917
I saw it on the television, and he says, "I am agnostic."

116
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,333
So the interviewer asked him,

117
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,875
"What are you doing here, then?"

118
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,792
He said, "I am doing my job."

119
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,959
So the interviewer said, "All right, I am also doing my job"

120
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:27,000
- mutual understanding between two mental projections.

121
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,583
The Holy Ghost is the reflection within you,

122
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,959
is this Kundalini.

123
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:51,083
No, the Kundalini you just show them.

124
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:55,917
The lower - no, no, kundalini you show, in the sacrum, now.

125
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,625
Now this kundalini has been described

126
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:08,375
very clearly in so many scriptures in India.

127
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,375
It is said in the Bible that

128
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:20,999
"I will appear before you like the tongues of flames."

129
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,834
These are the centers,

130
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,583
and this is the Tree of Life which is described.

131
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:41,458
Now in the Koran it is described as Assas.

132
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:50,583
Nowhere in any one of these ancient scriptures,

133
00:56:50,917 --> 00:56:52,959
or up to the time of Kabira

134
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,625
which was hardly four, five hundred years back,

135
00:56:56,999 --> 00:57:01,166
nobody said that this kundalini gives you any trouble.

136
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,625
But I have seen many people writing books

137
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,709
about kundalini later on,

138
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:28,041
and there is a very thick book like that,

139
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,917
I was amazed to see the description

140
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:32,999
they have given by a German writer about the kundalini,

141
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:37,333
that it can give you heat, it can give you diseases,

142
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,792
it can make you dance, it can make you jump.

143
00:58:01,834 --> 00:58:06,250
So this is how they have tried to condition you

144
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,166
against your evolutionary process.

145
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:20,166
And the religions which came after the great incarnations

146
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,125
also tried the same trick.

147
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,834
Paul is the person who started

148
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,709
this kind of conditioning in the Bible.

149
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,917
Actually Paul had nothing to do with Christ.

150
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:50,959
How is he in the Bible,

151
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:53,999
I could not understand from My very childhood.

152
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:02,166
And then he was born as Augustine

153
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:03,959
who again made the religion,

154
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,834
organized it, and conditioned it.

155
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,250
And today, surprisingly,

156
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,999
people are challenging Christ's birth,

157
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:29,500
His divine powers of creating miracles.

158
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,291
Now with their mental projection

159
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:39,583
they are trying to prove that He was just like us.

160
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:47,917
And also dirty filthy things

161
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,542
are said about Him and His Mother.

162
00:59:57,709 --> 00:59:59,959
This is hell that we have created

163
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,000
with our mental projections.

164
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,208
How dare we say these things

165
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,375
about such a great personality like Christ!

166
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:20,500
It is our ego which has made us so bold and so arrogant,

167
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,208
that we are preparing our own destruction

168
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:34,750
by challenging such personalities,

169
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:38,959
which can really protect us and guide us to our ascent.

170
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:50,000
This is again the result of this newness,

171
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:52,875
because the mind wants to find something new all the time,

172
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,000
develops this ego.

173
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,291
Like in America if you go,

174
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:09,166
you better ask them how to open the bathroom taps,

175
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,250
because every tap is different.

176
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:14,375
You may just press onto something and you may get drenched,

177
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:16,999
because they want to have every place new.

178
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:29,625
And they take hours together to decide

179
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:32,375
what kind of taps they are going to have.

180
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,834
Getting into the car, American car,

181
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,000
better ask them what, how to open the door,

182
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,166
because if there is an accident you may not know,

183
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,041
it may be something new.

184
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:02,542
This power to decide has gone so far

185
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:08,000
that people really appear to be just like stupid children.

186
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:19,083
Ego stops the maturity of a person.

187
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,625
The conditioning of the ego is the worst of all,

188
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:27,000
which cannot be removed.

189
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,041
If you are conditioned by your superego

190
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,500
you get your pains, you get your troubles,

191
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:41,041
but when you have got your ego

192
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:44,667
you trouble others, you aggress others.

193
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:02,792
Then to overcome the ego

194
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,000
they try again some mental processes,

195
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:17,208
that they try to dress up like primitive people.

196
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:24,125
By dressing up like primitive people

197
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,917
this brain is not going to become primitive.

198
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:39,625
I mean, you know that it has reached its maximum now;

199
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:43,625
it should stop behaving in that stupid manner.

200
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:57,625
Like in England if you go you'll find people are using

201
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,750
funny colors, to dress funny colors on their hair,

202
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,834
and they call themselves punks.

203
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,792
So I asked some of them who came to our program,

204
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:27,709
"Why do you do these kinds of things to yourself?"

205
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:41,375
So they said that this makes people very attractive.

206
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:48,208
To Me they look like clowns,

207
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,834
but to them they thought

208
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,667
that everybody feels attracted by that.

209
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:02,999
So the second curse I find

210
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:08,333
is that we want everybody should feel attracted towards us.

211
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,083
But what's the use?

212
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:28,875
It's a joyless pursuit.

213
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:36,375
If everyone is attracted towards us,

214
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,458
what does he get or what do you get out of that person?

215
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:42,125
- I fail to understand.

216
01:05:49,709 --> 01:05:52,875
But on the contrary, you get into trouble.

217
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:58,000
I mean, of course, if you become like punks

218
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,250
you can develop horrible blindness.

219
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:11,750
Or maybe you might develop

220
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,542
some problems of your skin in the head.

221
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:22,709
But the way you move your eyes all the time

222
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,542
to see how many are attracted by you,

223
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:27,125
you know what you can get?

224
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,500
This Altmiser's [Shri Mataji may mean "Alzheimer's"]

225
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:35,583
disease that is coming up now is the early lunatic behavior.

226
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,041
Now in America they have discovered

227
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,417
that before the age of thirty-five,

228
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:58,041
one out of the five becomes insane

229
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:02,000
- out of five, can you imagine?

230
01:07:02,417 --> 01:07:03,834
Out of five;

231
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:06,834
that's what I today I read it in Reader's Digest.

232
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:16,625
Can become, can become.

233
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:22,625
Altmiser's [Alzheimer's?] disease they call it.

234
01:07:22,959 --> 01:07:24,291
Altmiser's [Alzheimer's?] disease;

235
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,041
a new disease they said.

236
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,625
It's a name of the scientist, Altmiser [Alzheimer?] or something.

237
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:38,750
And they blame that if you lived after thirty-five

238
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,999
these things start propagating.

239
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,875
But in a simple country like India

240
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:57,917
or other countries where they are not so developed

241
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:02,166
to flirt around, they don't have this disease.

242
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,625
That's why Christ has said,

243
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:17,542
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

244
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:26,500
And it is so difficult to understand

245
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:30,458
that the people who go to church just want this.

246
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,458
I'm sorry I have to talk about this,

247
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:44,834
because I notice it everywhere I go in the West.

248
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:48,250
This is a terrible disease that is crawling up now.

249
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:01,834
It is to look at very frivolous,

250
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:07,875
but it is not, it has very deep implications.

251
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:21,166
The eyes have to be so innocent

252
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,834
that there should be no greed and lust

253
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,208
expressed through them.

254
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:38,291
The only solution I find is the kundalini awakening

255
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:42,542
and realization, through which Christ is awakened within you

256
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:45,625
in your central nervous system.

257
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,083
In the Agnya Chakra He resides,

258
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,834
which is on the optic chiasma

259
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,792
- which is in the optic chiasma.

260
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:23,333
If there is no innocence in a person,

261
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:29,083
then this Agnya Chakra catches.

262
01:10:33,917 --> 01:10:38,125
And this is the greatest purification that we need today.

263
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:48,500
Imagine, the people who say they are Christians,

264
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,583
these are Christian nations,

265
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,542
are the people going just against Christ

266
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:07,000
- it is very surprising.

267
01:11:08,583 --> 01:11:11,333
Whatever is preached by someone - like in India

268
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:15,125
it is said that in everyone resides the spirit;

269
01:11:20,834 --> 01:11:23,000
but the stupid intellectuals of India

270
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:26,291
are very busy with the caste system.

271
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,458
Such intellectuals must understand

272
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,875
that they cannot intellectualize God.

273
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:48,500
People don't like it when I tell them

274
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:51,125
that you have to purify yourself

275
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:54,959
to become the innocent personality.

276
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,959
The problem of the West today is, it has lost its value

277
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,000
as far as the purification is concerned.

278
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:23,500
The purification is not of the body,

279
01:12:23,834 --> 01:12:26,333
is not how you live clean outside,

280
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:31,166
it is not how you represent yourself, but it is within.

281
01:12:43,709 --> 01:12:47,959
The destruction is not going to work out from without,

282
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,583
it is within ourselves

283
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,750
we are building up our destruction every moment.

284
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:08,333
In 1972 when I first went to America,

285
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:11,917
I told them that "You do not take to Freudian theories,

286
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:15,083
and don't indulge into nonsensical perversions.

287
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,792
If you do that, you may develop a disease

288
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,999
which will kill the whole nation, and nations."

289
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,917
And you know the epidemic of AIDS has started.

290
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,625
You'll be happy to know that

291
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:51,709
through your kundalini awakening

292
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:54,166
you can cure all these diseases;

293
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:04,417
because when the kundalini is awakened,

294
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:06,375
the greatest thing that happens is

295
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:12,250
that whatever you have done so far is completely finished.

296
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:27,959
It happens in every chakra, but specially at the Agnya.

297
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:37,959
At Agnya Chakra, when she opens out the Agnya Chakra,

298
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,875
the deity of Christ is awakened.

299
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:53,291
And the ego and superego

300
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:59,083
which have made us into a egg-like structure

301
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:14,083
are just sucked in

302
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:18,041
spontaneously,

303
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:22,542
because kundalini is a living force

304
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,917
and that cleanses you completely.

305
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,792
Then you believe that Christ died

306
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,917
for our cleansing and purification.

307
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:44,625
He suffered and He was crucified for that,

308
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,625
so that He could come into that little space

309
01:15:47,999 --> 01:15:50,834
between the ego and superego.

310
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,875
Now the time has come to prove

311
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:13,208
all these great incarnations and all the great scriptures.

312
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:25,333
Now, when we talk of deities, people get quite stunned

313
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,834
because they have never heard about it.

314
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,542
Deities are the milestones,

315
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:46,125
like the people who came to save us, the leaders.

316
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:57,999
They had divine force within them,

317
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,750
and every time they came on this earth

318
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:06,000
they tried to give us a new awareness.

319
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:16,750
Like we can start from the first chakra,

320
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:19,917
is nothing but where the carbon was formed

321
01:17:20,208 --> 01:17:23,583
in the chemical periodical law.

322
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,375
By the formation of carbon only

323
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:40,250
we could have organic chemistry

324
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:44,417
and by that later on we had amino acids,

325
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,500
and then amino acids formed the life.

326
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,291
Then from the life came, as you know, amoeba,

327
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:13,000
and from amoeba today we are human beings.

328
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:27,959
But why don't we think about the reason,

329
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,542
the cause, why we have become human beings?

330
01:18:37,834 --> 01:18:41,000
Have we got something special about it,

331
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:45,999
that only we people should become human beings?

332
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:56,875
And what is the purpose of our lives?

333
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,917
Is it only to look at your watches

334
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,834
and waste your time in gambling?

335
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,792
Is it for that we are born

336
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,625
- not to have any respect for ourself?

337
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:28,542
To be frivolous is a crime in the eyes of the Divine.

338
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:39,333
You must know that you are very deep personalities.

339
01:19:42,834 --> 01:19:46,375
See the seven storeys you are built into.

340
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:55,041
You are the epitome of all the instruments

341
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:57,625
that you could think of.

342
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:08,375
Now only, what has to happen to you is the last triggering.

343
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:18,792
And once that happens you just get completely purified,

344
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:26,625
you become then the real instrument.

345
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:33,125
As every instrument has to be connected to the mains,

346
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:40,083
in the same way you are to be connected.

347
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,959
And then you realize how fantastic you are,

348
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:51,542
how dynamic you are,

349
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,333
what great powers you have.

350
01:20:57,959 --> 01:21:01,000
But it is not meant for the frivolous

351
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:09,667
or for the people who have no respect for their own beings.

352
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:18,709
It only happens to people who are true and honestly seeking,

353
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,125
truly and honestly seeking.

354
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:32,083
So it is important for us to know

355
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:36,709
that if we are going

356
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:41,917
to be the citizens of God's domain,

357
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:46,458
we have to get our realization, our Self.

358
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,750
Buddha went to this limit that He said,

359
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:07,417
"Don't talk of God, just talk of Self."

360
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:18,000
Even Mahavira said the same thing.

361
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,500
The Zen went even further,

362
01:22:23,834 --> 01:22:28,166
that it said only talk of thoughtless awareness.

363
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:36,999
That is the first awareness

364
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:41,000
one achieves as a kundalini awakening,

365
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:46,083
that you become completely aware without any thoughts.

366
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:02,417
Like when you see a beautiful lake

367
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,500
which has no ripples on it,

368
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:09,291
you see the complete creation around it reflected into it,

369
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:12,041
giving complete joy.

370
01:23:24,999 --> 01:23:29,333
So far we have not known the joy, which has no duality.

371
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:38,834
We know happiness which is nothing but ego pampering,

372
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:44,000
and when ego collapses a little, then we become unhappy -

373
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:07,208
that is the illusion we have.

374
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:16,750
To get to reality we have to be the Self,

375
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:25,000
and Self is beyond ego and superego.

376
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:35,166
Then you no more live on relative terminology,

377
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:44,333
but you live with absolute.

378
01:24:46,041 --> 01:24:50,125
Like you just feel the cool breeze in the hand

379
01:24:50,417 --> 01:24:53,208
as if it is the computer that has started,

380
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:56,875
and you are having a rapport with the Divine.

381
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:10,875
Even when you place your hand towards any question,

382
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,667
you can get the answer as cool breeze,

383
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:16,583
meaning "yes, very good" and as hot breeze,

384
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:19,500
meaning "bad"; but you might even get blisters

385
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:22,500
if you try to go near somebody

386
01:25:22,834 --> 01:25:25,792
who is a possessed personality.

387
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:49,625
All the information comes to you from the unconscious,

388
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:55,250
which has now become conscious on the central nervous system.

389
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,417
This is what one has to understand,

390
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:09,291
that your unconscious has become, has to become the conscious.

391
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:19,875
So whatever information you have been getting so far

392
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:21,208
from the unconscious

393
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:24,792
is completely clearly understood by logic.

394
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,208
So the first thing that happens

395
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:39,709
to your central nervous system, that you become

396
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,750
- again I say you become, collectively conscious.

397
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:45,917
It is not a mental projection, but you just become.

398
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,917
Also you know about yourself

399
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,834
because you know about your own centers,

400
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:06,458
and if you know how to cure these centers

401
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:11,917
then you are perfect, in perfect health, in perfect joy.

402
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,792
This was for the introduction of Sahaja Yoga:

403
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,999
saha means "with", ja means "born" - it's spontaneous.

404
01:27:46,959 --> 01:27:52,250
And "union" means, "union" is the meaning of the word "yoga."

405
01:27:56,917 --> 01:28:00,792
Also it has another meaning, which means yukti,

406
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,000
means "the trick."

407
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,542
Yukti.

408
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:16,709
And also the, it means the deftness,

409
01:28:17,041 --> 01:28:20,041
how to handle this power when it starts flowing through you,

410
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,917
to know everything about it; so it is to be decoded.

411
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:34,999
All this is your own.

412
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,375
One enlightened light enlightens another light.

413
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:48,709
There is no obligation.

414
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:52,542
It's all your own,

415
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:56,250
which you have to get it

416
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,083
and then establish it.

417
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:03,166
All this has to be free

418
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:11,875
because it is nature's gift, it is living process,

419
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,625
you cannot pay for it.

420
01:29:20,083 --> 01:29:24,750
You cannot pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed,

421
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,542
do you pay anything?

422
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:37,417
How much do we pay to the flowers for becoming fruits?

423
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,375
Nature doesn't understand money;

424
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:47,500
in the same way God doesn't understand money.

425
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:55,667
But the way we have lived so far,

426
01:29:55,959 --> 01:29:59,750
we have paid always money for God's work.

427
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:10,542
Specially in Switzerland people believe

428
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:13,792
that if you give money to some countries,

429
01:30:14,125 --> 01:30:16,083
then you are doing God's work.

430
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,959
Poverty is created by human beings, not by God.

431
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:34,792
A country like India, ruled for three hundred years,

432
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:38,125
if it becomes poor what's so surprising?

433
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,792
So that shows that by giving money

434
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,083
you are not doing God's work.

435
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:59,999
That's a human problem, created by human beings,

436
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:02,667
solved by human beings.

437
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:12,166
God's work is pure compassion:

438
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:18,000
compassion which doesn't speak,

439
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:23,542
which cannot be valued in money.

440
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,999
It just flows, emits and acts.

441
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:37,083
It doesn't expect anything,

442
01:31:38,291 --> 01:31:41,834
it cannot be controlled,

443
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,667
it cannot be killed,

444
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,834
it does not need any protection

445
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:54,333
- this is what it is, God's work.

446
01:31:55,834 --> 01:31:58,999
Because who is the other, for God?

447
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:04,208
We are all part and parcel of His being.

448
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:09,709
If this hand is helping another hand,

449
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,875
what obligation there is?

450
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:20,667
So one must understand the difference

451
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,834
between the reality of doing a God's work,

452
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:27,709
and the illusion.

453
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:40,458
It's the quality of Divine is such

454
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:48,417
that it quenches your thirst as the water does.

455
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:58,041
It gives you the light that guides you,

456
01:32:59,917 --> 01:33:05,875
it gives you the strength that makes you stand up on the right,

457
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:15,500
it gives you the compassion

458
01:33:15,792 --> 01:33:20,500
that makes you enjoy your virtues,

459
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:30,999
it gives you that attraction

460
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:36,000
which takes you to higher planes of the spirit.

461
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:52,458
It discovers all the pearls in the ocean of illusion.

462
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:59,999
It gives you that peace within and without,

463
01:34:03,542 --> 01:34:05,917
and you are always drenched in the showers

464
01:34:06,166 --> 01:34:08,709
of the bliss of the joy.

465
01:34:12,834 --> 01:34:15,333
It is your right to have it,

466
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:19,500
you have to have it.

467
01:34:20,709 --> 01:34:24,375
This is what you are meant to be here

468
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:28,583
- but with humility.

469
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:32,208
That is important,

470
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,542
as a gesture of grace.

471
01:34:39,625 --> 01:34:41,834
When somebody gives you a medal,

472
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:43,792
how you bend your head.

473
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:47,166
In the same way when you are adorned with this,

474
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,750
you have to bend your head before the Divine.

475
01:35:07,709 --> 01:35:12,625
When the audience claps for you, gives you a ovation,

476
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,875
standing ovation, the actor bends before it,

477
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:30,999
he salutes to the audience.

478
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:37,333
He salutes to the audience - all right?

479
01:35:37,709 --> 01:35:42,792
Now, in the same way we have to salute to the Divine.

480
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:51,208
What we surrender is automatically

481
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:54,291
our ego and our conditioning.

482
01:36:01,542 --> 01:36:06,375
I hope today you all will receive your realization.

483
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:17,083
And day after tomorrow when I speak on the spirit itself,

484
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:20,709
I hope you'll make it convenient to come down.

485
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,458
You have to later on establish it completely.

486
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:43,083
Otherwise it will be like the parable of Christ,

487
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:48,750
that the seeds which sprouted also

488
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:52,125
did not take to roots.

489
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:15,208
May God bless you all.

490
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:28,709
You want Me, to ask some questions?

491
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,792
Good. Let's have now the experience.

492
01:37:57,166 --> 01:38:00,250
How to protect oneself from somebody

493
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:03,959
from whom you feel on the chakras something not nice?

494
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,834
Ego problem.

495
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:14,583
Ah, all right.

496
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:18,792
That is what you have to learn.

497
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:24,083
Before realization also you catch from others,

498
01:38:24,375 --> 01:38:26,291
but you don't feel it.

499
01:38:32,166 --> 01:38:34,834
But after realization you feel, but temporarily,

500
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:37,500
just like an indicator.

501
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,999
So you have to learn how to protect,

502
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:49,250
and when you come to our center

503
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:55,208
they will tell you everything elaborately.

504
01:39:04,166 --> 01:39:07,083
Whenever I have come to Switzerland

505
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:10,583
or any other place I've seen the houses are always full,

506
01:39:10,999 --> 01:39:12,625
people like to listen to Me;

507
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,709
but they don't listen to one thing,

508
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:18,375
that they have to make it a practice,

509
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:24,208
a complete understanding, a complete happening.

510
01:39:48,834 --> 01:39:53,125
There is no course, there's no course for it,

511
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:58,250
but you have to yourself understand

512
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,208
from others who have achieved,

513
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,834
and you can be masters yourself.

514
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:24,500
Only thing, you have to give some time.

515
01:40:30,417 --> 01:40:33,792
Swiss are very good at making good watches,

516
01:40:38,208 --> 01:40:41,458
and they want people to save their time;

517
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:47,250
but they have no time for God.

518
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:51,834
Same with Japanese who are very good at watches,

519
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:54,500
they have no time for God.

520
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:03,959
They make watches for others, not for themselves.

521
01:41:06,999 --> 01:41:09,542
They are busy making watches.

522
01:41:11,834 --> 01:41:16,166
Now you have to be selfish also, you must look at yourself.

523
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:22,542
Better save some time for God

524
01:41:25,625 --> 01:41:27,709
and for yourself.

525
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:35,333
So now we'll have the - if you have any questions,

526
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:37,792
you can always know that

527
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:43,625
we have a regular center in Switzerland,

528
01:41:43,999 --> 01:41:46,667
and you can always go and meet those people,

529
01:41:46,959 --> 01:41:50,291
get all the answers from them.

530
01:42:09,959 --> 01:42:13,125
Now, first of all I have to request you all

531
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:15,750
to forgive yourself

532
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:25,166
and to forget whatever I've said,

533
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,875
because I do not want that

534
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:34,834
you should feel guilty about anything.

535
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:41,542
This is the biggest hurdle in the West,

536
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:44,875
that people feel guilty for everything.

537
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:55,917
I mean even if you wear a something which is not matching,

538
01:42:56,208 --> 01:42:58,834
people start feeling guilty.

539
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:05,667
It is too much, the way we feel guilty,

540
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,125
so I have to make very humble request

541
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,375
that you don't feel guilty at all.

542
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:22,625
With whatever you have been doing,

543
01:43:22,917 --> 01:43:24,458
whatever has been there,

544
01:43:24,834 --> 01:43:26,166
one must know that

545
01:43:26,542 --> 01:43:29,999
you are the temple of God Almighty,

546
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:42,375
and your kundalini is quite capable

547
01:43:42,792 --> 01:43:46,083
of giving you realization, purifying you completely;

548
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:49,166
but don't feel guilty about anything.

549
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:03,208
That is a first condition:

550
01:44:06,458 --> 01:44:09,125
we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves

551
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:12,999
because we are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

552
01:44:23,834 --> 01:44:25,792
Second thing I have to request is that

553
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,375
we have to take the advantage of the Mother Earth,

554
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:31,500
though I know it is a little cool, but doesn't matter,

555
01:44:31,792 --> 01:44:36,041
you can take out your shoes and put your feet on the ground;

556
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:40,875
because the shoes also sometimes are a little bit tight,

557
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:43,917
and keep you out of touch with the Mother Earth.

558
01:45:00,917 --> 01:45:03,959
It's a very, very simple method,

559
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:08,333
extremely simple, because we are just ready.

560
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:12,041
It's extremely simple because you are just ready.

561
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:21,792
Now first of all we'll have to see that

562
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:27,999
we try to feel our own chakras

563
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:31,542
and clear them out ourselves,

564
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:45,375
because if there are any complications, they can be removed.

565
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:56,750
For that I will tell you how to place your right hand,

566
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,166
but the left hand should be towards Me like this,

567
01:46:00,667 --> 01:46:04,417
symbolizing your desire to get your realization.

568
01:46:24,959 --> 01:46:27,375
Now the right hand should be used

569
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:32,542
for touching centers on the left-hand side.

570
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:40,000
And it's very simple:

571
01:46:40,208 --> 01:46:45,500
first we'll put our hand on the heart, when I tell you.

572
01:46:54,542 --> 01:46:57,834
Then we have to put it in the upper part of the abdomen,

573
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:04,792
then in the lower part of the abdomen,

574
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:11,667
then again on the upper part of the abdomen,

575
01:47:16,083 --> 01:47:18,250
then on the heart again.

576
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:24,542
Now one has to place the hand here,

577
01:47:27,999 --> 01:47:32,250
in the corner of the neck and the shoulder

578
01:47:36,041 --> 01:47:41,083
- from the front, like this, not from back.

579
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:48,500
This is the center which is the worst always,

580
01:47:48,959 --> 01:47:52,208
which catches when you feel guilty.

581
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:03,250
Look at it as if you are looking at something jocular.

582
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:06,083
What is there to feel guilty?

583
01:48:14,583 --> 01:48:16,083
Another mental projection;

584
01:48:18,667 --> 01:48:20,667
it's an illusion.

585
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:23,834
All right. Now, then you have to place your hand

586
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:28,041
on top of your forehead across like this,

587
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,709
and then on the back.

588
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:40,250
Then you have to stretch your palm

589
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:45,250
and put this part on the fontanel bone area.

590
01:48:51,667 --> 01:48:55,999
Press it hard, and you have to move it seven times clockwise

591
01:48:56,291 --> 01:48:58,667
when I tell you.

592
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,417
Now, do not try to stop your thoughts or anything,

593
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:14,208
it will all work out spontaneously.

594
01:49:20,458 --> 01:49:22,166
If there are too much thoughts,

595
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,875
then you can put your attention here on the fontanel bone.

596
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,375
So let us start now.

597
01:49:37,208 --> 01:49:39,291
All of you must do it.

598
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:42,041
If those who do not want to do it should go out,

599
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:45,959
don't trouble others, because others become self-conscious.

600
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:04,458
It is not civil.

601
01:50:07,417 --> 01:50:12,333
Now, everyone has to close the eyes.

602
01:50:16,417 --> 01:50:18,917
Take out your spectacles

603
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:25,417
because you don't have to see anything,

604
01:50:25,709 --> 01:50:28,250
you have to keep your eyes shut.

605
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:49,750
Now.

606
01:50:52,625 --> 01:50:55,750
Now, put your left hand towards Me just like this,

607
01:51:01,959 --> 01:51:04,625
and have faith in yourself.

608
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:12,000
Now, forgive yourself and close your eyes,

609
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:14,542
keep your eyes shut.

610
01:51:20,959 --> 01:51:23,917
Close your eyes, put your right hand on your heart

611
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:26,625
and left hand towards Me.

612
01:51:33,667 --> 01:51:36,000
On your heart.

613
01:51:36,458 --> 01:51:39,709
Left hand towards Me and right hand to be used

614
01:51:40,041 --> 01:51:43,709
for the action. Tell them.

615
01:51:51,333 --> 01:51:54,166
Now, please put your right hand on the heart,

616
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,500
right hand on the heart.

617
01:52:02,542 --> 01:52:07,500
So the left hand has to be kept on your lap, upward.

618
01:52:17,667 --> 01:52:20,333
Be comfortable,

619
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:24,041
you have to be comfortable.

620
01:52:31,375 --> 01:52:36,333
Now, you have to ask Me

621
01:52:37,250 --> 01:52:39,999
a very fundamental question.

622
01:52:44,417 --> 01:52:46,999
In the heart resides the spirit,

623
01:52:47,291 --> 01:52:50,834
so please ask Me a question three times,

624
01:52:51,125 --> 01:52:53,333
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

625
01:52:53,625 --> 01:52:56,375
If you can call Me "Shri Mataji" it's all right, or "Mother"

626
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:58,709
- whichever suits you.

627
01:53:31,125 --> 01:53:34,208
You must really have faith in yourself.

628
01:53:57,709 --> 01:54:01,875
Now, take down this right hand on your stomach,

629
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:05,291
on the upper part on the left-hand side,

630
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:16,000
and press it.

631
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:24,250
This is the center of the mastery,

632
01:54:29,375 --> 01:54:33,417
which is created by prophets who came on this earth.

633
01:54:38,667 --> 01:54:43,000
So here, you have to ask Me another question.

634
01:54:43,375 --> 01:54:48,709
If you are your spirit, then you have to be your own guide.

635
01:54:49,083 --> 01:54:52,542
So you have to say, "Mother, am I my own guide?

636
01:55:12,834 --> 01:55:14,792
Am I the prophet?

637
01:55:19,542 --> 01:55:22,208
Am I my own guru,

638
01:55:27,417 --> 01:55:29,999
am I my own master?"

639
01:56:01,291 --> 01:56:04,999
Three times.

640
01:56:10,208 --> 01:56:13,458
Now, please take down your hand

641
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,583
in the lower part of the abdomen and press it.

642
01:56:26,375 --> 01:56:28,999
This is the center

643
01:56:33,458 --> 01:56:38,041
of the knowledge about the Divine.

644
01:56:44,959 --> 01:56:47,208
This knowledge is not mental,

645
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:49,250
but the technique

646
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:54,166
that builds into your central nervous system.

647
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:09,000
So here you have to say something,

648
01:57:09,625 --> 01:57:12,500
because I cannot force you

649
01:57:13,166 --> 01:57:19,458
to accept the procedure of kundalini awakening.

650
01:57:32,999 --> 01:57:37,166
Now, you have to yourself ask

651
01:57:37,709 --> 01:57:41,041
that you want to know about the true knowledge,

652
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:43,125
about the pure knowledge.

653
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:44,834
So please say six times,

654
01:57:45,166 --> 01:57:48,000
"Mother, may I have the true knowledge?

655
01:57:48,291 --> 01:57:50,625
May I have the pure knowledge?"

656
01:57:50,959 --> 01:57:54,542
With this saying the kundalini will start moving.

657
01:58:24,625 --> 01:58:27,458
Six times, please ask the question,

658
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:31,375
"Mother, please may I have the true knowledge,

659
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:34,291
the pure knowledge?"

660
01:59:10,291 --> 01:59:14,458
Now we have to make way for the kundalini, which is awakened.

661
01:59:14,792 --> 01:59:16,250
Please keep your eyes shut.

662
01:59:22,834 --> 01:59:24,000
Raise your right hand

663
01:59:24,333 --> 01:59:27,417
and put it in the upper part of the abdomen.

664
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:41,041
Now, please keep your eyes shut, don't open in between,

665
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:43,500
because attention has to go inside.

666
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:55,834
At this point, as I told you, is the center of your mastery.

667
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:13,583
Now here you have to say with full faith in yourself,

668
02:00:13,999 --> 02:00:15,917
asserting,

669
02:00:18,291 --> 02:00:21,792
"Mother, I am my own master.

670
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:34,667
I am my own guide, I am my own prophet."

671
02:00:43,125 --> 02:00:45,500
Please say it ten times.

672
02:01:17,917 --> 02:01:20,166
Please do not feel guilty when you say that,

673
02:01:20,458 --> 02:01:21,959
please do not feel guilty.

674
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:33,291
You are the prophet.

675
02:01:35,834 --> 02:01:40,333
William Blake has said that "Men of God," meaning seekers,

676
02:01:40,999 --> 02:01:42,041
"will become prophets,

677
02:01:42,333 --> 02:01:44,917
and they'll have powers to make others prophets."

678
02:01:56,834 --> 02:01:58,959
You are the men of God,

679
02:02:02,999 --> 02:02:05,500
and you will become prophets.

680
02:02:06,792 --> 02:02:09,500
Ah - now, better.

681
02:02:12,083 --> 02:02:14,834
William Blake helped!

682
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,875
Now, please raise your hand to your heart.

683
02:02:42,792 --> 02:02:45,375
You should not say things speedily,

684
02:02:45,709 --> 02:02:48,542
but with understanding and with depth.

685
02:03:01,333 --> 02:03:05,375
Now at this point you have to again assert

686
02:03:05,709 --> 02:03:07,917
with full confidence in yourself and say,

687
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:12,500
"Mother, I am the spirit." Say it twelve times, please

688
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,999
... Now, now better. Working out.

689
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:55,917
Now, raise your hand onto the corner

690
02:04:56,625 --> 02:05:01,166
between your neck and the shoulder.

691
02:05:09,417 --> 02:05:15,041
Take it quite back so that you can press on the bone.

692
02:05:26,458 --> 02:05:29,709
Here you have to say,

693
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,792
with full faith in yourself,

694
02:05:35,083 --> 02:05:38,917
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all."

695
02:05:48,834 --> 02:05:54,500
You have to know that apart from God

696
02:05:54,917 --> 02:05:59,667
who is the ocean of love and compassion,

697
02:06:00,041 --> 02:06:05,667
above all He is the ocean of forgiveness.

698
02:06:16,917 --> 02:06:20,000
Whatever your guilt may be,

699
02:06:20,542 --> 02:06:24,667
compared to the power of the Divine to forgive,

700
02:06:24,959 --> 02:06:27,500
you cannot have any guilt.

701
02:06:38,417 --> 02:06:43,542
So please say sixteen times, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all."

702
02:07:24,083 --> 02:07:27,834
Even some people feel that they cannot believe

703
02:07:28,125 --> 02:07:29,792
that they are not guilty,

704
02:07:30,125 --> 02:07:33,542
so to punish themselves they can say it 108 times!

705
02:07:47,458 --> 02:07:49,750
That's better.

706
02:07:50,083 --> 02:07:53,625
Nobody wants to have the punishment, is a good idea.

707
02:08:02,667 --> 02:08:05,083
Better?

708
02:08:08,583 --> 02:08:13,583
Now, raise your hand to your forehead, please

709
02:08:19,709 --> 02:08:24,208
and - with the palm towards your forehead,

710
02:08:24,542 --> 02:08:27,250
and press it on both the sides.

711
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:34,542
Put it across, across.

712
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:44,500
I mean, place it horizontally.

713
02:08:48,583 --> 02:08:51,417
And now press it hard.

714
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,750
Here you have to say, not how many times

715
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,667
but from your heart,

716
02:09:02,959 --> 02:09:05,667
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

717
02:09:15,166 --> 02:09:17,625
Some people think that it's difficult,

718
02:09:17,959 --> 02:09:19,667
but it is a myth when you believe

719
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,792
that you forgive or you don't forgive.

720
02:09:33,208 --> 02:09:37,542
But if you forgive everyone,

721
02:09:38,041 --> 02:09:42,291
then you do not play into the hands of wrong people

722
02:09:42,625 --> 02:09:45,041
- in a mythical way, of course.

723
02:09:58,917 --> 02:10:04,583
Now, raise your hand and take it backwards

724
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,709
to your back side of your head, and hold it tight.

725
02:10:17,999 --> 02:10:21,542
Press your hand little backward and hold it tight.

726
02:10:25,959 --> 02:10:29,417
Now here you have to say,

727
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:33,583
for your own satisfaction maybe,

728
02:10:34,834 --> 02:10:37,291
that "Oh Divine, please forgive me

729
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:41,999
if I have done anything wrong against You."

730
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:15,999
Now stretch your hand,

731
02:11:16,208 --> 02:11:18,625
and put your palm on top of your head

732
02:11:18,999 --> 02:11:23,166
on the fontanel bone area and press it hard, very hard,

733
02:11:23,417 --> 02:11:24,999
in a clockwise manner,

734
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:30,333
saying one thing, that you want your realization;

735
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:33,667
because I cannot cross your freedom here again.

736
02:11:33,999 --> 02:11:36,959
So please say, "Mother, I want my realization.

737
02:11:37,208 --> 02:11:40,417
Please give me my realization," seven times.

738
02:11:49,208 --> 02:11:52,417
Press it with the palm only, not with the fingers.

739
02:13:52,999 --> 02:13:56,667
Now take down your hand slowly,

740
02:14:01,959 --> 02:14:05,208
open your eyes slowly.

741
02:14:10,208 --> 02:14:14,125
Place your right hand towards Me,

742
02:14:17,625 --> 02:14:22,125
and with the left hand you place it on your top of your head.

743
02:14:26,291 --> 02:14:28,041
Don't think, don't think,

744
02:14:28,333 --> 02:14:31,166
see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

745
02:14:46,542 --> 02:14:48,834
Change your hand, please.

746
02:14:50,458 --> 02:14:52,834
Put your right hand

747
02:14:54,792 --> 02:14:58,583
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out.

748
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:09,208
Don't be nervous;

749
02:15:10,166 --> 02:15:13,375
it is subtle, it is very subtle.

750
02:15:15,999 --> 02:15:18,750
Now, change over again.

751
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:34,000
Now, put your hands up like this and push back your head,

752
02:15:34,375 --> 02:15:36,999
and ask a question.

753
02:15:41,417 --> 02:15:46,999
On the mike - come nearer to the mike.

754
02:15:47,583 --> 02:15:48,750
Now ask a question,

755
02:15:48,999 --> 02:15:51,750
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

756
02:15:52,041 --> 02:15:53,750
Is this the Brahma Shakti?

757
02:15:54,041 --> 02:15:59,500
Is this the all-pervading God's love?"

758
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:20,500
Now, bring down your hands, please.

759
02:16:22,583 --> 02:16:25,417
See for yourself.

760
02:16:26,709 --> 02:16:31,959
Don't think. Are you feeling it on your hand?

761
02:16:42,083 --> 02:16:45,291
Those who are feeling cool breeze on their hand

762
02:16:45,667 --> 02:16:48,166
- it's very subtle - or out of their head,

763
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,458
please raise your both the hands.

764
02:17:07,417 --> 02:17:09,875
Most of you have felt it.

765
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:13,000
But I will now tell you how to protect yourself,

766
02:17:13,291 --> 02:17:15,041
all of you should know how to protect;

767
02:17:15,458 --> 02:17:18,999
because some have not felt because they have a problem here,

768
02:17:19,375 --> 02:17:20,583
in the Vishuddhi Chakra.

769
02:17:20,875 --> 02:17:23,834
Or maybe they have not forgiven others.

770
02:17:41,834 --> 02:17:43,959
Try this. Put your right hand towards Me

771
02:17:44,208 --> 02:17:47,166
and your left hand like this, for balancing

772
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,625
- to the sky.

773
02:18:01,417 --> 02:18:04,875
This is now we use the ether.

774
02:18:22,083 --> 02:18:25,041
If you are feeling the cool or something down below,

775
02:18:25,333 --> 02:18:27,917
put it back like that,

776
02:18:28,166 --> 02:18:30,959
if you are feeling down below.

777
02:18:38,792 --> 02:18:43,041
These people are very speedy and they are very right-sided,

778
02:18:43,417 --> 02:18:45,000
so this is the problem they have.

779
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:47,792
Doesn't matter, it will work out.

780
02:18:55,583 --> 02:18:58,083
Think too much!

781
02:19:02,250 --> 02:19:04,709
Futuristic, they are futuristic.

782
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:16,291
Facing your problems only, you solve them.

783
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:23,125
Not mental projection

784
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,709
but facing, just seeing them as they are.

785
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,458
You are the spirit, you are not the problem;

786
02:19:33,834 --> 02:19:35,792
you are beyond all this.

787
02:19:40,125 --> 02:19:41,834
After realization the word "problem"

788
02:19:42,083 --> 02:19:44,999
goes out of your dictionary!

789
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,500
Now, put the left hand like this

790
02:19:54,750 --> 02:19:57,625
and the right hand towards the Mother Earth ....

791
02:20:08,291 --> 02:20:11,792
Better, much better.

792
02:20:33,458 --> 02:20:36,000
Don't think.

793
02:20:37,041 --> 02:20:39,999
You can do it now.

794
02:20:47,959 --> 02:20:52,417
Now, I will tell you how to protect. It's very simple.

795
02:20:59,041 --> 02:21:03,583
You have to give protection to your auras.

796
02:21:03,917 --> 02:21:06,625
You can wear your glasses if you want to.

797
02:21:13,959 --> 02:21:15,125
That you must all do,

798
02:21:15,417 --> 02:21:18,208
whether you have felt the cool breeze or not.

799
02:21:23,458 --> 02:21:26,083
You give protection to your auras in this manner,

800
02:21:26,417 --> 02:21:27,875
that you put left hand like this

801
02:21:28,166 --> 02:21:30,125
and right hand around the auras,

802
02:21:30,458 --> 02:21:33,959
you take over your head and bring it down like that.

803
02:21:37,208 --> 02:21:39,458
Left hand towards Me.

804
02:21:49,792 --> 02:21:53,041
All right, let's do it seven times, for seven auras.

805
02:21:56,125 --> 02:21:59,375
One - don't think.

806
02:22:00,542 --> 02:22:03,375
Don't think!

807
02:22:05,041 --> 02:22:07,000
Three,

808
02:22:08,917 --> 02:22:11,583
four,

809
02:22:12,542 --> 02:22:15,041
five,

810
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:18,291
six

811
02:22:18,792 --> 02:22:21,875
and seven.

812
02:22:22,291 --> 02:22:23,500
It's important.

813
02:22:23,792 --> 02:22:26,417
Now, how to raise your own kundalini,

814
02:22:26,709 --> 02:22:28,333
that's very simple again.

815
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:37,375
Now put your left hand in front of your kundalini

816
02:22:37,709 --> 02:22:40,625
- you yourself can do it.

817
02:22:47,208 --> 02:22:50,750
And it should be moved from up, forward, down,

818
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,667
like that clockwise, right hand.

819
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:58,000
Left hand should be steady, left hand should be straight.

820
02:23:07,583 --> 02:23:09,375
And then down.

821
02:23:09,875 --> 02:23:13,583
And this hand should move straight.

822
02:23:16,999 --> 02:23:19,959
Attention should be on the left hand.

823
02:23:22,083 --> 02:23:25,000
Now, try to move the hand properly.

824
02:23:25,375 --> 02:23:27,041
On top of your head you have to take it,

825
02:23:27,333 --> 02:23:28,750
take it on top of your head.

826
02:23:28,959 --> 02:23:33,083
Bend back your head, and give it a twist,

827
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:36,125
and give it a twist, big twist,

828
02:23:36,542 --> 02:23:39,709
and tie it up like a knot.

829
02:23:40,417 --> 02:23:45,542
Again let's do, to fix it up properly. Again do it, please.

830
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:49,041
Second time, let's just do it.

831
02:23:49,417 --> 02:23:52,959
Now push back your head, and give it a big twist,

832
02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:57,291
and give it a knot.

833
02:23:57,667 --> 02:24:01,083
Now, third time same way, but three knots.

834
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:05,709
Again.

835
02:24:06,041 --> 02:24:08,542
Now it's moving fast.

836
02:24:09,083 --> 02:24:11,417
Put it - now one,

837
02:24:12,999 --> 02:24:15,083
again give a twist;

838
02:24:15,458 --> 02:24:17,000
two,

839
02:24:17,333 --> 02:24:20,208
again a twist; and a three.

840
02:24:20,542 --> 02:24:23,542
Now see your hands.

841
02:24:26,999 --> 02:24:29,792
You feel much lighter.

842
02:24:35,625 --> 02:24:39,417
Feel it on your head also, cool breeze coming out.

843
02:24:43,625 --> 02:24:46,458
You'll be absolutely relaxed.

844
02:24:47,041 --> 02:24:49,125
You cannot think now;

845
02:24:49,542 --> 02:24:51,166
but if you want, you can.

846
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:55,250
But don't think about it, you can't think about it.

847
02:24:59,999 --> 02:25:03,500
Just feel it - all of you have got it.

848
02:25:10,834 --> 02:25:12,875
Good!

849
02:25:13,291 --> 02:25:16,583
You'll see, your eyes will be sparkling.

850
02:25:16,625 --> 02:25:19,458
There will be light in your eye.

851
02:25:23,375 --> 02:25:25,291
Now, you don't think.

852
02:25:25,583 --> 02:25:27,542
Otherwise next time when I come, you'll say,

853
02:25:27,834 --> 02:25:30,125
"Mother, I have lost my vibrations."

854
02:25:33,458 --> 02:25:36,083
If you think about it you cannot reach there.

855
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,959
All right. Now if you want to shake hands with Me,

856
02:25:46,166 --> 02:25:47,667
I will sit here for you for a while.

857
02:25:47,999 --> 02:25:49,375
You can come round to shake hands.

858
02:25:49,667 --> 02:25:51,000
But Sahaja yogis, you need not

859
02:25:52,333 --> 02:25:55,083
- otherwise there's just no end to it!

860
02:26:14,375 --> 02:26:17,208
Ah, ah. You can come here and see.

861
02:26:17,542 --> 02:26:21,291
Did you feel the cool breeze? Did you? Now that I can see.

862
02:26:21,583 --> 02:26:23,250
Philip, just help him, just see

863
02:26:23,542 --> 02:26:25,417
- the gentleman didn't feel the cool breeze.

864
02:26:25,875 --> 02:26:27,166
He's on the, more on the right.

865
02:26:27,542 --> 02:26:30,500
Give him a right to the ....

866
02:26:37,125 --> 02:26:40,792
All right. Just a minute, please, just a minute.

867
02:26:41,166 --> 02:26:44,667
Hallo, how are you? Felt it? You've enjoyed it?

868
02:26:51,709 --> 02:26:53,500
Hallo, how are you?

869
02:26:53,792 --> 02:26:55,999
May God bless you.

870
02:28:02,709 --> 02:28:05,375
Yes, I'll be there.

871
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:13,709
No, I'll be - when will he be back? ....

872
02:28:17,375 --> 02:28:20,834
Oh, I see, and then London, he won't be there? ....

873
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:25,166
He got his realization? ....

874
02:28:44,792 --> 02:28:46,250
Oh, I know, yes, I know.

875
02:28:46,542 --> 02:28:48,458
All right, so he can come to London?

876
02:28:48,750 --> 02:28:50,333
I'll be in London.

877
02:28:53,333 --> 02:28:57,625
All right .... All right, all right.

878
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:07,291
Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you.

879
02:29:07,583 --> 02:29:11,166
You got your realization. Good ....

880
02:29:15,208 --> 02:29:20,000
Yes. May God bless you. I'm so very happy.

881
02:29:20,417 --> 02:29:21,583
Now you're all right.

882
02:29:21,917 --> 02:29:26,208
Now you must, you must completely become Sahaja yogis

883
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,917
so that you have full confidence.

884
02:29:28,375 --> 02:29:30,417
You must have full confidence, all right? ....

885
02:29:30,792 --> 02:29:35,458
I'm very happy it should happen. May God bless you.

886
02:29:43,667 --> 02:29:46,125
.... What happened to you?

887
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:49,125
All right.

888
02:29:49,375 --> 02:29:52,375
So it has happened to you? Good.

889
02:29:54,375 --> 02:29:58,125
She is a born-realized, a great person.

890
02:29:58,458 --> 02:30:01,834
Now look at your eyes. Can you see the eyes of each other?

891
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,999
Who talked?...

892
02:30:52,125 --> 02:30:56,417
No, no. She cannot do it. There is a science about it.

893
02:30:57,041 --> 02:30:58,500
This is a born-realized child.

894
02:30:58,834 --> 02:31:00,792
He's wrong.

895
02:31:05,333 --> 02:31:06,959
He's wrong. That will not.

896
02:31:07,208 --> 02:31:10,208
You must have the full knowledge, all right?

897
02:31:11,542 --> 02:31:13,542
You call the lady who's got asthma,

898
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:15,625
he'll cure her, but just tell him

899
02:31:15,917 --> 02:31:18,250
to get the lady with the asthma.

900
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:23,166
[Hindi]

901
02:31:37,041 --> 02:31:40,208
How are you? Glad you got it.

902
02:31:40,875 --> 02:31:44,333
[Hindi] ....

903
02:32:16,041 --> 02:32:18,291
You have to establish yourself, that's important,

904
02:32:18,542 --> 02:32:21,041
then you have to give it to everybody ....

905
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:31,291
I will tell that. But you see once we ....

906
02:32:36,125 --> 02:32:38,709
Yes, the thing is, you see,

907
02:32:38,999 --> 02:32:41,875
that in one lecture that you can't speak about everyone.

908
02:32:42,083 --> 02:32:44,625
But I've spoken about all of them

909
02:32:44,875 --> 02:32:47,166
- Jesus, because the more here they worship Jesus.

910
02:32:47,583 --> 02:32:50,166
But all of them are spiritual, they're all our own,

911
02:32:50,458 --> 02:32:52,333
there's no difference ....

912
02:33:04,458 --> 02:33:06,041
That's it.

913
02:33:06,458 --> 02:33:07,959
Yes, that's it, that's it.

914
02:33:08,208 --> 02:33:10,792
So now you learn it, and you will listen to My other lectures

915
02:33:11,041 --> 02:33:13,250
where I've talked about everyone, all right?

916
02:33:13,583 --> 02:33:15,792
May God bless you.

917
02:33:20,291 --> 02:33:22,917
.... He's the brother of ...

918
02:33:25,709 --> 02:33:28,417
You are getting a nice sister-in-law!

919
02:33:35,792 --> 02:33:37,917
... That's your brother?

920
02:33:38,208 --> 02:33:39,542
They'll be all right, you see,

921
02:33:39,875 --> 02:33:42,542
because people are so recently here, and when I came,

922
02:33:42,834 --> 02:33:44,208
I had a diplomatic passport,

923
02:33:44,542 --> 02:33:48,083
but only they examined Me on the sense of the passport

924
02:33:48,417 --> 02:33:51,000
and then they saw My ticket, and all that - nobody else.

925
02:33:51,375 --> 02:33:53,709
They are like that, very ... people, what to do?

926
02:33:53,999 --> 02:33:57,583
You don't know, you must get some more Indians to ....

927
02:34:04,250 --> 02:34:06,792
He'll be all right, no doubt about that.

928
02:34:07,083 --> 02:34:08,792
And you also get them in Mumbai!

929
02:34:12,542 --> 02:34:16,083
Hallo, how are you? ....

930
02:34:26,667 --> 02:34:28,250
Confidence.

931
02:34:28,542 --> 02:34:29,959
All right, that's what I feel,

932
02:34:30,208 --> 02:34:31,792
that you people lack in confidence.

933
02:34:32,125 --> 02:34:33,417
Now what you think is shaken

934
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:36,875
by all kinds of nonsensical doubts people have sown in you.

935
02:34:37,208 --> 02:34:40,333
You are the spirit, and you have to become that.

936
02:34:40,667 --> 02:34:43,834
I'm guiding you to become completely confident, all right?

937
02:34:44,083 --> 02:34:46,125
So you have to come and see these people also,

938
02:34:46,458 --> 02:34:48,709
these are ... but I'm coming after ...

939
02:34:48,750 --> 02:34:51,500
I'll come day after tomorrow, all right?

940
02:34:51,834 --> 02:34:53,291
Call your friends already.

941
02:34:53,583 --> 02:34:56,792
I must make you all very, very confident.

942
02:34:57,583 --> 02:35:00,792
But definitely come, because ....

943
02:35:18,999 --> 02:35:22,417
Cambodia? Ah!

944
02:35:38,208 --> 02:35:41,166
How are you?

945
02:35:43,041 --> 02:35:45,166
Just enjoy, enjoy yourself!

946
02:35:45,542 --> 02:35:47,959
But you have to be confident, and let it work out.

947
02:35:48,333 --> 02:35:50,000
Again and again ....

948
02:35:50,333 --> 02:35:52,375
You have to follow up, then you should see ....

949
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:55,875
Absolutely confident about it, all right?

950
02:35:56,125 --> 02:35:58,208
May God bless you.

951
02:35:58,542 --> 02:36:01,792
So how are you?

952
02:36:05,291 --> 02:36:07,667
May God bless you.

953
02:36:08,125 --> 02:36:12,959
Now come along, you have become very brave, all right?

954
02:36:13,667 --> 02:36:17,000
Tell her that I said that you should come,

955
02:36:17,375 --> 02:36:19,750
and come very soon. Thank you very much.

956
02:36:20,917 --> 02:36:23,458
Are you all right? ....

957
02:36:40,333 --> 02:36:43,375
That's not going to help

958
02:36:48,083 --> 02:36:51,208
That's all right, but you must know everything about it also,

959
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:52,458
and this is fine.

960
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:54,917
You see, you should not do it indiscriminately ....

961
02:37:02,625 --> 02:37:04,959
I'll leave that to them, they're all here.

962
02:37:05,208 --> 02:37:08,333
You stay here? Yes?

963
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:10,291
The day after tomorrow I am coming,

964
02:37:10,542 --> 02:37:11,917
and they'll give you addresses.

965
02:37:12,166 --> 02:37:13,458
Yes, and day after tomorrow

966
02:37:13,792 --> 02:37:15,208
you have to bring your friends also.

967
02:37:15,458 --> 02:37:18,667
You are from what country?

968
02:37:20,792 --> 02:37:22,333
Peru?

969
02:37:26,875 --> 02:37:30,959
All right, bring all of them. All right? I must see them.

970
02:37:51,542 --> 02:37:54,000
How are you? How did you feel?

971
02:37:56,458 --> 02:37:59,250
What country you come from?

972
02:38:01,417 --> 02:38:03,750
Puerto Rico! Oh, nice country.

973
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,291
I have to go to all these places sometime.

974
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:08,333
I must go. I haven't been there yet, but I will go.

975
02:38:08,667 --> 02:38:10,542
Let's see ...

976
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:15,458
Are you here? Oh, great! How are you? ...

977
02:38:26,291 --> 02:38:29,083
Come along! And get your friends! Just tell them,

978
02:38:29,375 --> 02:38:34,000
they must come! All right? May God bless you.

979
02:38:38,083 --> 02:38:42,917
Now, how are you? ... No, haven't you met?

980
02:38:48,166 --> 02:38:50,417
... You are not Bolivian? ....

981
02:39:03,625 --> 02:39:06,458
So, how are you? ....

982
02:39:19,458 --> 02:39:21,291
Now, but you have to forgive.

983
02:39:21,583 --> 02:39:23,667
You must say it. You have to forgive.

984
02:39:23,959 --> 02:39:27,875
You must forgive everyone ....You have to forgive.

985
02:39:28,125 --> 02:39:29,750
Just say it, "I forgive."

986
02:39:30,041 --> 02:39:32,375
Just say that, "Mother, I forgive."

987
02:39:32,667 --> 02:39:36,375
Just say it, from your heart.

988
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:50,875
Ah, now, see?

989
02:39:57,166 --> 02:39:59,999
Now, establish yourself. That's very important.

990
02:40:00,083 --> 02:40:02,959
Otherwise you will not have confidence. Must establish.

991
02:40:03,208 --> 02:40:05,834
The aspect more I'm telling, watch your ... also ....

992
02:40:06,166 --> 02:40:07,999
And then you have to see these people.

993
02:40:20,333 --> 02:40:23,083
Ah, so nice!

994
02:40:23,667 --> 02:40:26,709
Ah, great!

995
02:40:26,999 --> 02:40:27,999
I've been to that side.

996
02:40:28,291 --> 02:40:30,709
And I've given realization to people in Russia.

997
02:40:30,999 --> 02:40:33,417
I'm going to .... They're the first who will get it.

998
02:40:33,667 --> 02:40:36,250
They're very good. They're very good people.

999
02:40:36,709 --> 02:40:41,667
People are very good in Russia, very good. Great souls!

1000
02:40:53,667 --> 02:40:57,000
In fourteen weeks we'll teach them from India.

1001
02:41:00,625 --> 02:41:02,875
But they're very friendly, nice people.

1002
02:41:03,083 --> 02:41:05,583
We can have a rapport with them very easily.

1003
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,583
We'll manage that.

1004
02:41:07,917 --> 02:41:10,375
I'll try on the government level.

1005
02:41:13,333 --> 02:41:15,834
We can do it.

1006
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:19,250
May God bless you.

1007
02:41:24,542 --> 02:41:27,291
Come now.

1008
02:42:09,375 --> 02:42:11,667
Establish yourself.

1009
02:42:21,500 --> 02:42:26,083
Just say, "Mother, come in my head. That's all."
