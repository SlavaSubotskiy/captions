1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,859
Guru Puja.

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:06,930
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:20,300
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:35,730
What does a guru do.

5
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:50,680
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:59,600
Actually it is all there - everything.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:15,570
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

8
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:30,150
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:38,170
It's all contained within you.

10
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:57,210
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

11
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,490
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

12
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,590
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

13
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,560
There is nothing that you get from outside.

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:29,780
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

15
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:40,739
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

16
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:55,200
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,459
That is the first step.

18
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:12,710
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

19
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,000
world, this is all an illusion.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,209
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

21
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:33,040
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

22
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,240
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

23
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:49,579
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

24
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:59,329
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

25
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,700
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

26
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,140
to know yourself.

27
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,940
But people get into rituals.

28
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,700
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

29
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:33,470
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

30
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,220
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

31
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:47,700
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

32
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,320
Because it is all ignorance.

33
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:01,680
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

34
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:13,400
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

35
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,710
They pamper your ego.

36
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:28,650
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

37
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:37,350
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

38
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,940
connection with God, which you are not.

39
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,880
To know God you should know your Self first.

40
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,810
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

41
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,690
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

42
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,230
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

43
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,350
The experience is not sufficient.

44
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,040
The knowledge has to come.

45
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,150
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

46
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,160
Now you have to tally it.

47
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,200
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

48
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,820
Is it true or not?

49
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,440
Is it correct or not?

50
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,600
Or is it just another illusion?

51
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:46,310
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

52
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,600
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

53
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:58,861
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

54
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:02,870
is something special about you.

55
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:15,760
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

56
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:24,750
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

57
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:38,140
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

58
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:46,780
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

59
00:07:46,780 --> 00:08:01,610
Then what starts is introspection.

60
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:10,640
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

61
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,050
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

62
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:29,250
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

63
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:38,829
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

64
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:45,160
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

65
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,639
great and they don't need any introspection.

66
00:08:49,639 --> 00:09:00,269
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

67
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,980
it Self realisation.

68
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:11,350
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you, how

69
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,970
far you have come.

70
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:23,529
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

71
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,709
You can do it later on.

72
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,370
You must hear with full concentration.

73
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:39,560
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

74
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
gradually.

75
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
How?

76
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:54,639
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

77
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,779
very gentle and mild.

78
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:13,360
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

79
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,100
At that stage you have no fears.

80
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:29,310
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

81
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,339
You are not easily disturbed there.

82
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:42,949
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

83
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:48,069
is something wrong within yourself.

84
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:53,880
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

85
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:02,820
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

86
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:14,670
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

87
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:29,380
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,740
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

89
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:43,279
to verify how far it is correct.

90
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:57,759
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

91
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:13,800
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

92
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:22,809
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

93
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:34,600
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

94
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:45,740
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

95
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:59,950
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

96
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,500
How you love.

97
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,730
What is the quality of your compassion?

98
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:25,120
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

99
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:33,699
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

100
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:37,490
You will do anything for that person.

101
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:44,029
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

102
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,730
This is just the love.

103
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:56,600
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

104
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:12,529
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

105
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:25,089
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

106
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:35,079
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

107
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:48,879
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

108
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,839
that person you try to tolerate.

109
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,119
Such a person just tolerates.

110
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:18,889
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

111
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,839
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

112
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:31,029
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

113
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,839
They don't have any anger about anyone.

114
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,519
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

115
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:53,179
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

116
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:59,649
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

117
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:07,190
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

118
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,019
People never liked them.

119
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:23,800
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

120
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,579
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

121
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:42,199
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive

122
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,199
them.

123
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,420
What they are doing they don't know'.

124
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,769
Extremely compassionate.

125
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,920
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

126
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:06,370
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

127
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:11,020
They are not disturbed.

128
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:20,560
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

129
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:28,230
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

130
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:36,170
They just enjoy their devotion.

131
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,770
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

132
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,770
Devotion to God.

133
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:57,630
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

134
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:06,380
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

135
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:18,590
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

136
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:33,020
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

137
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,570
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

138
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:48,560
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

139
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,280
but they are in the present.

140
00:18:51,280 --> 00:19:00,480
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

141
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:13,210
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them, they immediately go into thoughtless

142
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,580
awareness.

143
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,560
That is what their capacity is.

144
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:27,010
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

145
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,780
Now I'll tell you my own example.

146
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:38,670
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

147
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:46,360
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

148
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,900
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

149
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,090
and one child fell down.

150
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:03,070
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

151
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,520
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

152
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,950
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

153
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,680
I said, "I'll go in any case!

154
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,090
". So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

155
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,380
go to the airport".

156
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,190
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

157
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,950
Let's go!".

158
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:36,411
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

159
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:41,540
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York, and I wanted to go to Washington

160
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,370
only!

161
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:56,380
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

162
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:05,050
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

163
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,190
That means it's a effortless.

164
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:27,230
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

165
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:39,390
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

166
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:50,900
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

167
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,020
guarantee for your safety.

168
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,790
For everything that you want to do.

169
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:07,640
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

170
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
You can become also very powerful!

171
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:20,850
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

172
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:31,210
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

173
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,860
you have to have.

174
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,880
Everything is provided by the Divine.

175
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:52,150
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

176
00:22:52,150 --> 00:23:05,341
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

177
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:11,330
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

178
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:19,320
You just close your eyes and things work out.

179
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:28,160
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

180
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,460
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

181
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:42,600
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

182
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:56,450
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

183
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,590
for which the Divine is responsible.

184
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,460
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

185
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,930
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

186
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:21,450
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

187
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:30,870
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come, he'll

188
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,230
never come.

189
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:38,580
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

190
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,490
use your compassion.

191
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,260
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

192
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:57,390
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

193
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,450
So now you have got your Self realisation.

194
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,990
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

195
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:13,790
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

196
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,540
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

197
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:30,090
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

198
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:36,670
And some men also are like that.

199
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:46,510
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

200
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:54,280
you should win over the partner of your life.

201
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,800
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

202
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,850
But women indulge into so many other things.

203
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:11,320
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

204
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:20,100
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

205
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,230
Without meditation you cannot rise.

206
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,370
You have to meditate.

207
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,340
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

208
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
No!

209
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,860
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

210
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,270
With the cleansing you understand.

211
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:52,830
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

212
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,310
That is done by Divine.

213
00:26:54,310 --> 00:27:03,070
But you must religiously meditate.

214
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:12,620
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

215
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:23,840
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

216
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,360
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

217
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:38,010
All sorts of problems can be solved.

218
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,680
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

219
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:51,520
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

220
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,630
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

221
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:07,090
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

222
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,340
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

223
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:23,130
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

224
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:29,030
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

225
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,160
It just envelops you completely.

226
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,840
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

227
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,440
It works so many miracles.

228
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:52,390
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

229
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:59,120
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

230
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,020
to develop shraddha.

231
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:11,690
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

232
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:23,610
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

233
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:31,160
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

234
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:38,140
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

235
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:44,130
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

236
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:52,360
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

237
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,280
do it for popularity.

238
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,050
Many people are like that.

239
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,720
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

240
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,010
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

241
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:17,810
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

242
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:26,980
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

243
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:37,970
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

244
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,940
solutions to things.

245
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,910
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

246
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:55,480
It can find solutions to all your problems.

247
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:05,940
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

248
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,220
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

249
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:17,030
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

250
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:24,810
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

251
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:34,100
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

252
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:46,530
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

253
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,220
within, which makes you understand.

254
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:58,400
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

255
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,750
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

256
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:12,820
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

257
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,590
it to the leader.

258
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:21,560
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

259
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,530
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

260
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:38,490
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

261
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,750
They never see their own faults.

262
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,710
What's the use of finding faults of others?

263
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:51,620
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

264
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:58,670
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help, which you can work

265
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,620
it out.

266
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:11,010
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

267
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,840
defects and get them corrected.

268
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:24,130
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this, "I like this, I like

269
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,130
that".

270
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,620
But what about the Spirit?

271
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,820
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

272
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,610
Does it like?

273
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,620
Does it enjoy?

274
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,780
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

275
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,310
It's very common in the West.

276
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,540
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

277
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:01,610
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

278
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:13,499
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine what I feel

279
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,769
about them.

280
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:21,220
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

281
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:32,089
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

282
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:42,259
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

283
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,889
grace on your being.

284
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,240
The love of other people enthrals you.

285
00:34:46,240 --> 00:35:02,099
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

286
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,339
friendship in that kind of relationship.

287
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:12,300
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

288
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:21,329
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

289
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:28,059
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

290
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,300
person -- instead of helping that person.

291
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,470
Always people are in trouble.

292
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,940
Then collectively you must help that person.

293
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,160
Not talk ill of that person.

294
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:49,390
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

295
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:56,519
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

296
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:07,079
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

297
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,690
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

298
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,730
You had the experience.

299
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,950
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

300
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:29,420
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge is really there or

301
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,559
not.

302
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:45,210
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

303
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,599
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

304
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,099
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration what's wrong

305
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,099
with me".

306
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:04,859
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

307
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:15,799
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

308
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:19,319
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

309
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,789
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

310
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:31,589
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

311
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:45,400
And they have given us such a good attention,
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their

312
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,020
hospitals.

313
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:57,509
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself, what

314
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,490
are you?

315
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:11,490
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

316
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:32,430
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

317
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:41,640
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

318
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:51,769
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

319
00:38:51,769 --> 00:39:00,849
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved, a great

320
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:01,849
personality.

321
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:08,440
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

322
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,002
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

323
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:22,440
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

324
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,990
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

325
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:41,660
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

326
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:50,609
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

327
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:53,279
Are you one of these type?

328
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:59,920
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

329
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,239
It's a process, I must confess.

330
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:09,460
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

331
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:18,180
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

332
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:22,190
had a very strong desire.

333
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,720
What are we seeking?

334
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:31,270
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

335
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:37,739
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

336
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,239
So we seek.

337
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,609
We seek.

338
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:46,260
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

339
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:55,160
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

340
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:01,759
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

341
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:06,789
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

342
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:14,470
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

343
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:21,220
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

344
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,799
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

345
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:33,749
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

346
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:36,970
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

347
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,029
She said, "I gave it up".

348
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:48,470
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

349
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,460
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

350
00:41:52,460 --> 00:42:02,980
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

351
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,410
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

352
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,190
Guru's job is to guide people.

353
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,780
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

354
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,920
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

355
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,749
That I have to tell you.

356
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:28,700
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

357
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:38,019
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

358
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:45,619
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

359
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:54,079
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved, what is your

360
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,549
understanding?

361
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:57,990
What do you know?

362
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,960
Why these disasters are coming?

363
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,529
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

364
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:09,170
It has to become very collective.

365
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,460
It has to spread much more, all over.

366
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,950
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

367
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,210
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

368
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,900
But go all out!

369
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,279
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

370
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:32,069
Of course the people went into wrong things.

371
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:39,759
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

372
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:48,630
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

373
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:56,980
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

374
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:04,499
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

375
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:07,259
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

376
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:19,619
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

377
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,349
for the collective?

378
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:23,109
Are we talking about it?

379
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:25,440
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

380
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,270
Are we making people know about it?'

381
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:40,220
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad

382
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,280
vibrations.

383
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:54,910
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

384
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,029
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

385
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:01,089
"My God" I said.

386
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:06,579
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

387
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,770
So, what will happen?

388
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,770
Disasters!

389
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:18,819
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

390
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:28,300
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

391
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,890
to them, and how they spread their message.

392
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:39,770
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

393
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:45,240
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

394
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,890
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

395
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:56,150
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

396
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,270
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

397
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:11,869
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

398
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:16,630
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

399
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,519
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

400
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,509
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

401
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:28,660
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

402
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,440
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

403
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,039
nonsense, you get it.

404
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,140
You are saved from so many things.

405
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,480
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

406
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,869
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

407
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,849
But why not save the whole world?

408
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:07,670
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

409
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:14,119
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

410
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,550
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

411
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:23,019
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

412
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:31,869
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

413
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,680
Go everywhere.

414
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,309
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:44,989
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

416
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:54,080
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

417
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,660
to save this Mother Earth.

418
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,239
You have to save the people who are in it.

419
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:06,170
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

420
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,560
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

421
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,359
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

422
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,970
Not that the people are stupid.

423
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:28,299
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

424
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:35,180
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

425
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:42,460
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

426
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:49,769
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

427
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:53,619
we don't want!".

428
00:48:53,619 --> 00:49:02,109
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

429
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:06,589
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

430
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:08,569
God is wrathful, no doubt.

431
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:13,779
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

432
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:18,160
We have to save this Mother Earth.

433
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:25,490
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

434
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:28,970
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

435
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,150
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

436
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:38,690
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

437
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,660
You can talk about it to people.

438
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:49,050
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

439
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:55,599
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

440
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:02,160
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same and talk about

441
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
it.

442
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:12,069
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

443
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:21,309
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

444
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:26,450
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

445
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:32,470
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

446
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,329
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

447
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:39,619
Because you are always saved.

448
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:44,249
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

449
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:50,259
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

450
00:50:50,259 --> 00:51:03,390
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

451
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:16,099
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

452
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:20,849
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

453
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,490
to fight it.

454
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:29,019
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

455
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,019
a difference.

456
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:34,650
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

457
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:44,369
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

458
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:56,510
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

459
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:00,510
above jealousies, above talking loose.

460
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:07,559
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

461
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,309
gurus if you try to do that.

462
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:13,569
This is what you have to achieve.

463
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:20,020
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

464
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,609
May God Bless You All
