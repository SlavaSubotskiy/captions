1
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,460
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

2
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,100
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

3
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:28,350
many of you are wondering why God has created 
these beautiful things. Because you people

4
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:38,010
had to come on this Earth and enjoy the beauty 
that is one of the reasons. And now God feels

5
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:56,100
very much fulfilled with the joy and satisfaction 
and a kind of a completion of His desire.

6
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:06,920
Why God has created this beautiful universe 
has been a question asked for thousands of

7
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,380
years.

8
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:25,060
The reason is very simple to understand: this 
beauty that is created cannot see itself.

9
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:36,170
In the same way, God who is the source of 
beauty, cannot see its own beauty, like a

10
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,550
pearl cannot enter into itself to see its 
beauty, like the sky cannot understand its

11
00:09:43,550 --> 00:10:02,800
own beauty, the stars cannot see their own 
beauty, the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance,

12
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:17,620
in the same way God Almighty cannot behold 
His own being. He needs a mirror and that

13
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:28,040
is how He has created this beautiful universe 
as His mirror. In this mirror He has created

14
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:40,190
now beautiful things like the Sun, then the 
Sun has to see his own reflection also. So

15
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:50,950
He has created these beautiful trees to see 
that when he shines, they come up so well

16
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:57,600
and look so green. 
Then He has created those birds to rise early

17
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,230
in the morning to greet the Sun, so the Sun 
knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

18
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,200
or else He has created these beautiful lakes 
for these trees to see their reflection and

19
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,940
the lakes to feel their existence when the 
ripples start moving within themselves.

20
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,090
So then He created human beings. The human 
beings cannot also see their own beauty, their

21
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:35,430
own glory. That is why they are in the darkness, 
they are ignorant. They cannot see what lies

22
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:44,450
within themselves. So they are running after 
something which is absolutely against themselves,

23
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:55,450
which is ugliness, which is self destructive. 
And the struggle to get to reality is such

24
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:03,520
a lot, that as a result, they destroy themselves. 
Like as people have taken to these drugs,

25
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,110
taken to all bad habits – of in this place, 
they say a lot of smuggling going on – and

26
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:16,290
all such endeavors that people take up because 
they do not know what beautiful things they

27
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,020
are.

28
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,520
So now a mirror has to be created for them, 
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

29
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,950
Their mirror is their Spirit. That Spirit 
is to be brought in their consciousness, in

30
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:40,680
their attention. If it comes in their attention 
then they can see their image. Now this attention

31
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:54,160
that comes in, as an enlightened attention 
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

32
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:03,130
is the expression of the attention which is 
enlightened. But it is also said that it is

33
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:10,700
got a nature, which is very transitory, or, 
we can say, which is disappearing every moment

34
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:19,790
to moment. When this is happening what is 
to be done? For that you have to steady yourself

35
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:35,290
with meditation, with hearing the enlightened 
talks, by seeing the good things of life without

36
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:44,480
thinking about them, by seeing also the goodness 
of others and then you start seeing goodness

37
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,820
in yourself also. 
That is why I always say that one should not

38
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:58,040
feel guilty, because you are feeling guilty 
of something, which is just, just an illusion.

39
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,650
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. 
It is something like that. So if you know

40
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:12,510
that you are beautiful beings and that you 
have got a shadow is nothing to do with you

41
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:20,540
and your beauty. If you can see you own beauty 
then you will be amazed that within us lies

42
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:27,350
all those joy giving, all those beautiful 
things, which we are seeing outside. But just

43
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,320
now, the mirror is not all right, that’s 
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

44
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:43,430
But, when you are one with your Self, then 
you see all these nature within yourself,

45
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,040
all the joy giving qualities of this nature 
within yourself.

46
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,520
So I wanted you to come to this place just 
to learn how God has created this beautiful

47
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:03,140
area for you people to enjoy and to be here. 
May God bless you.
