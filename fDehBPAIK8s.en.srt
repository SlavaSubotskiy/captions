1
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:13,566
Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant

2
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:21,317
that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this earth

3
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:24,359
as Shri Krishna.

4
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:38,359
So many aspects of His being have been described

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,192
in so many of my lectures to you all;

6
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:47,775
but the greatest and greatest of all the aspects

7
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:51,775
of this Primordial Being

8
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:55,650
was that He was the Yogeshwara.

9
00:00:55,691 --> 00:01:01,983
He was the God of Yoga - Yogeshwara.

10
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:15,150
He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.

11
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:23,483
Without His permission and without His sanction we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

12
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:35,441
He was Yogeshwara and a real Yogi is a person

13
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:45,317
who gets this Yogeshwara awakened within him.

14
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:50,275
The word "Yoga", that we understand,

15
00:01:50,275 --> 00:02:03,942
is the union of our attention with the Divine.

16
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:09,608
But still we do not realize the implications --

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:18,359
what does it mean? What should happen to us?

18
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,067
Of course you get powers.

19
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:24,691
As soon as you become the spirit you get powers.

20
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,400
One of the powers you get is of collective consciousness --

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,192
that is also the gift of Shri Krishna --

22
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,150
and that you start feeling the collectivity.

23
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:39,691
Your ego and superego is sucked in,

24
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:45,942
so you get rid of your karmas and your conditionings

25
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:51,150
and a new sprouting of the new life of the new age starts.

26
00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:01,234
But still what is the speciality, the greatness of Yogeshwara?

27
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:12,483
Because He is Ishwara for you. He is the Ishwara of all the Yogis

28
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:20,566
and what is His capacity, what is His nature?

29
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:27,483
That for Him everything is a play - Leela.

30
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,858
For Shri Rama it was not a play.

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:44,359
For Him life was a platform on which he had to demonstrate

32
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:53,608
how to lead a very dharmic life as Maryada Purushottama.

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:10,150
But Shri Krishna came up to show that He is the Leeladhara --

34
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,359
the one who plays the Leela, the play.

35
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:21,234
The whole thing is a play, the whole universe is a play.

36
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:25,691
All that is created by Adi Shakti, all these three gunas

37
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:33,359
is nothing but a play. And that is what He manifested

38
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,399
in His own incarnation. But still what is Yogeshwara?

39
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:45,650
Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play,

40
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:49,817
that He is at the axis, and for the whole periphery

41
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:59,900
is nothing but a play. Because everything is false.

42
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,317
Except for your spirit everything is false.

43
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:13,359
It's all a joke going on, you can say,

44
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,109
a drama going on, nothing so serious.

45
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,900
Spirit is the only truth within us the rest is all untruth.

46
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:25,942
There cannot be many types of truths you see.

47
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,650
In Sanskrit language there is only truth or untruth,

48
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:32,109
satya or asatya, there are no ten words for truth.

49
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,608
So when this happens,

50
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:42,067
this great happening takes place within you,

51
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:46,067
when you become one with [the] Spirit you get powers

52
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:53,109
without even your maturity reaching that stage,

53
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:57,650
your understanding reaching that stage

54
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,900
and your heart opening out.

55
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:12,650
so that you have faith with open understanding.

56
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:17,192
You should have faith with experience of it

57
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:21,067
so it starts off. When you start using your powers

58
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:25,359
you see it is manifesting, you are sometimes amazed,

59
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,359
how you raise Kundalini of people,

60
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:31,983
how you tie them up, how you give them realization,

61
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,942
how you cure people.

62
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:36,067
You are amazed, how it has happened.

63
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:40,192
So we can say it is all built within you

64
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,275
which has started manifesting.

65
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:48,234
But there is so much more that has to still manifest,

66
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:54,025
which has to establish and make you grow.

67
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:59,025
One of the very important points is the Yogeshwara

68
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:04,566
and that point we must understand

69
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:13,317
that unless and until you follow the path of Yogeshwara,

70
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,900
you cannot establish yourself fully.

71
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:20,067
So Krishna has said that:

72
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:24,608
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja"

73
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,858
"You give up all your relationships...",

74
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,275
dharma is relationship. Like your sister, your brother

75
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:40,441
you see these are dharmas, like Sri dharma  a woman's job.

76
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:46,359
Then we can say also there is Rashta dharma.

77
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,317
Today is the day of India's freedom.

78
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:56,441
So we have Rashta dharma, we are patriotic people.

79
00:07:56,441 --> 00:08:01,858
Patriotism to your own country is Rashta dharma.

80
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,608
Then you have got Samaj dharma

81
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:13,399
that is duty towards your society, is Samaj dharma.

82
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,275
Then you have got Pati dharma, husbands' duties,

83
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:28,025
wives' duties. Everybody's duties are called as dharmas

84
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,942
because this is what you have to do,

85
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,858
you are duty bound - they form your dharmas.

86
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,109
But He says, "Give up all these dharmas,

87
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,691
give up all the duties, just surrender yourself fully to Me"

88
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:46,566
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja".

89
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:51,275
Because you have become now the collective being,

90
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,234
now you have become one with Him,

91
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:56,608
now He looks after your dharmas,

92
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,608
He looks after your relationships,

93
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,942
He cleanses them, He purifies them,

94
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:04,192
so you just surrender yourself to Him fully.

95
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:10,900
He said it to Shri Arjuna only not to everyone.

96
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,733
He didn't say to everyone they didn't deserve it,

97
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,441
or He didn't think it proper to say to them.

98
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:20,525
But I think you are proper people to know this

99
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:25,192
so I'm telling you that: forget every other duty

100
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:28,025
to every other thing but do your duty

101
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,942
to your collective being, to your collectivity.

102
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:39,025
But He is Yogeshwara. That's the main point.

103
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:43,359
And to do duty to Him first and foremost thing

104
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:49,733
is you have to develop that purity of a Yogeshwara.

105
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:59,817
For Him sublimation was not needed  He was sublime.

106
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,109
He was the source of sublimation.

107
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,317
He did not need sublimation from the baser instincts

108
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:13,150
of human beings. He did not need anything to do,

109
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,441
to be done to Himself to raise Himself out of the maya

110
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:22,150
as they call it. Especially in the West, as you know,

111
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,525
we have created a hell for ourselves - real hell.

112
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:34,192
All kinds of perverted ideas are within us.

113
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,067
To a Yogeshwara this is nothing but maya,

114
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:44,608
absolutely filth. Never comes into His [mind]

115
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,817
that such things are possible - they are shocking.

116
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:52,775
On His birthday - I would say if today is His birthday

117
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:57,150
and if He was born as He was at that time --

118
00:10:57,192 --> 00:11:01,359
He would have gone back immediately.

119
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,733
He would have said, "No sorry, I've nothing to do,

120
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,817
had enough." And that too,

121
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,858
if He had met the Western culture,

122
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:12,234
He would have been shocked back

123
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,817
he [would have] said, "Oh God, no, nothing doing.

124
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:17,275
I'm not coming here.

125
00:11:17,317 --> 00:11:21,067
Despite the times when He was born,

126
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:23,317
where there was dharma, there were people

127
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,234
[who] understood what was right, what was wrong.

128
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:27,858
When there was none of these nonsensical things

129
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:32,858
were there - He came as Yogeshwara - pure.

130
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:41,858
The story of His is that once His wives wanted to go...

131
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:46,067
to Him what was wives? Nothing - is just a play.

132
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,483
To Him no sin can be attached.

133
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:51,192
He married because He had to marry

134
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:56,317
His five principles or the five elements.

135
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,983
So He made them into women and married them.

136
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:01,691
He had to marry 16,000 women

137
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:06,817
because He had to have 16,000 powers

138
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:12,650
and He had to channelize them through some bodies,

139
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,775
so they came as women.

140
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:19,317
To Him it was not a relationship of a wife

141
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:22,150
but a pure relationship.

142
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,483
To Him sex had no existence at all.

143
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:30,817
He was beyond it.

144
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,608
So no question of temptations

145
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,025
and perversions - is out of [the] question.

146
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:40,942
The story is that once His five wives wanted to go

147
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:45,400
and pray to some saint who had come,

148
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:53,817
a great saint, to their town.

149
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:57,650
But he really stayed across the river.

150
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:01,525
So they wanted to go and worship him

151
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:05,359
and they found a very good time when they could go and see him.

152
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:10,650
So when they went near the river they said

153
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,525
"It is in spate we cannot cross it,

154
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,359
it's not the time that you can cross it."

155
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,566
So they felt it was very inauspicious if they did not go

156
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,900
and that was such an auspicious time.

157
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:29,733
They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.

158
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,775
So they went to Krishna and said that

159
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:35,608
"Now, how can we cross, the river is in spate?"

160
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:41,942
He said: "Really? Doesn't matter.

161
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:49,192
You go and tell the river.." - that is the river Yamuna river,

162
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:52,400
no I'm sorry  Tapi, Tapi river..

163
00:13:52,441 --> 00:14:03,566
He said "Go and tell the river that 'if we have a husband

164
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:11,234
who is Shri Krishna, is a Yogeshwara - that means

165
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:14,192
who has never indulged into any sex activity..."

166
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:18,025
Yogeshwara means a person who has never indulged

167
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,483
into any sex relationships.

168
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:26,441
That's not possible. One cannot think of such a thing.

169
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:29,650
Means though He indulged, He never indulged into [it].

170
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:37,650
Though He was in it still He was not there, like a lotus. "...

171
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:45,525
If He has not indulged into any such action..." --

172
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:51,566
it's a... only possible for Him, nobody else.

173
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,400
That's why He is an incarnation,

174
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,150
He's not a human being.

175
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,817
Only incarnations can do it.

176
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:58,733
If some human being starts saying that

177
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:02,150
"I am Shri Krishna, so I am doing this and I am doing that",

178
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,150
like you see, there are very bombastic ones,

179
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,691
you must have heard about them.

180
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:10,817
They do not become, is only an incarnation can do it.

181
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:19,400
That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.

182
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,983
So they went and told the river that,

183
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:28,150
"If He is the Yogeshwara, then please you subside."

184
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:35,566
And she went down. So they went to the other side,

185
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,858
did the puja to the guru and they came back.

186
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,983
Again the river was in spate and they could not cross.

187
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:45,942
So they went to the guru.

188
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:52,399
This is the sign of a good guru or a real guru,

189
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,942
is an incarnated guru. And they said that

190
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:01,650
"See, we cannot cross, the river is in spate."

191
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,691
So they said: "Really, how did you come?"

192
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,650
They said, "Shri Krishna asked us,

193
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:15,400
that 'if I am the Yogeshwara, it will go down, you ask the question'."

194
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:20,234
So he said: "All right, now you go and ask the question,

195
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:37,733
that if I am the bhukta. Bhukta, that means

196
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:41,608
if I have eaten all the food you have given me,

197
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,441
but I have not enjoyed it, I've not indulged into it,

198
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:50,566
then let the river subside."

199
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,566
They went and told the river,

200
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,317
I mean they could not believe it

201
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,817
because they had fed him, that:

202
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,650
"Whatever food we offered him,

203
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,566
if he has not eaten any food, then you subside".

204
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,400
And the river subsided!

205
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:18,775
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal,

206
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:28,234
your ideal again, in this respect, is Shri Krishna.

207
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:37,691
Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest.

208
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:41,733
This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do.

209
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,858
They think immediately they have become now

210
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,025
Shri Krishna or they have become something greater

211
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:59,942
or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves

212
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:05,067
It's not so - that one thing one has to know,

213
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:12,900
that that is the ideal you have to reachand your eyes

214
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,775
should be towards that ideal and the movement

215
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:18,441
should be towards that. Before that,

216
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:23,275
if you fall into any such thing like perversions

217
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:26,150
and nonsensical sexual things and all that,

218
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,817
you must know that you are falling down very badly.

219
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,566
It's a possession that is working on you.

220
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:36,942
That's an ideal - they are incarnations.

221
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:41,067
You are not incarnations nor can you become incarnations.

222
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:45,858
But they are the light, which are enlightening your path,

223
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,400
on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm

224
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,566
where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.

225
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,150
He is Ishwara - He is your Ishwara.

226
00:18:56,192 --> 00:19:01,858
You are not Ishwaras. But you are at least the Yogis.

227
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:08,275
We have to be the yogis first, then He is our Ishwara, nah?

228
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,359
Otherwise He doesn't want to rule you.

229
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,942
So what we have to do, is to become the Yogis first.

230
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:21,067
And one of the signs of a yogi is

231
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:28,399
that he is in his sex life extremely pure.

232
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:40,441
Absolutely purity must exist

233
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:44,483
and after some time one should get beyond.

234
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:53,067
Your relationships with other people,

235
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:57,858
whether it is your sister or a brother

236
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,650
or any other woman or any other man,

237
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:05,525
there should be complete purity.

238
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:11,817
And this is extremely important.

239
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:18,817
Now in the countries like India, people are extremely corrupt,

240
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:23,942
very corrupt, extremely corrupt. You can give them 5 rupees

241
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,483
and you can buy anybody there.

242
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,608
It's very corrupt, moneywise.

243
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,858
But people are not so immoral, they know it is immorality,

244
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,150
I mean they know. I mean if they do immoral thing

245
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,817
they know it is not moral.

246
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:44,399
In the West the immorality has become a general rule.

247
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,525
For them the 'morality' word should vanish now.

248
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:49,817
I mean it doesn't exist like morality.

249
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:51,400
Do anything whatever you like,

250
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:53,900
people don't think of immorality.

251
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:58,067
They don't want to talk of it, "it is Victorian."

252
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,483
And if somebody says that one should be moral,

253
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,733
they start thinking he's an hypocrite.

254
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,067
I mean they cannot think there can be any connection

255
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:09,525
between human being and morality in a genuine way.

256
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:14,400
This is a big problem we have. It's the biggest problem we have.

257
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,983
Now corruption is something you can avoid

258
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:25,192
because if you are not corrupt, it is alright, you can be.

259
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:28,483
But immorality is such a thing that,

260
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:35,441
if you live in an immoral world, it has effect on everyone.

261
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:38,359
For example, a moral woman is walking on the road

262
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,150
and there is a man full of lust and all that looking at her.

263
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,691
In any way she looses her chastity.

264
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:48,359
She doesn't mean to attract him or anything,

265
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,150
she doesn't want to loose her chastity,

266
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,359
but the way he is looking at her, you see,

267
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:58,483
though her simple methods are there, she may be responsible

268
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,983
in a distant way to ruin his chastity,

269
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:06,900
his morality. Even a little child, who is a simple,

270
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:10,109
innocent child but if there''s a dirty man with a dirty eyes,

271
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,733
he can have very dirty feelings for the child.

272
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:18,608
So, though of course that person himself is dirty and all that,

273
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,650
we cannot say the child is not affected.

274
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:23,359
But in a way, that becomes an object,

275
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,900
a sort of a Vastu as you call it.

276
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:30,733
A thing which makes another person

277
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,817
even lower than what he is.

278
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:38,067
Even an ordinary picture, which has nothing to do,

279
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,858
is placed there, any funny thing

280
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:46,025
which is giving some dirty feelings.

281
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:51,150
Because these days I have seen so many symbols

282
00:22:51,192 --> 00:22:55,025
have started, which to my eye I don't even see

283
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,942
there is anything wrong in it.

284
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:00,234
That to my eye I can't see because I'm too innocent.

285
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:03,150
My eyes can't see [that] there''s anything wrong.

286
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:05,900
But to somebody, who is an expert on these things,

287
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,525
[he] will immediately say, "oh look at this."

288
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:13,608
I mean really it is impossible to understand

289
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,317
how the human mind has really woven their yarns

290
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,691
all around and made these patterns

291
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,192
to ruin themselves and ruin others.

292
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:33,150
So to worship Yogeshwara we must know

293
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:40,234
that our relationships with everyone in this world

294
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,399
has to be pure.

295
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:49,109
He played lots of things in His lifetime.

296
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,025
The time when He came,

297
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:58,275
the whole country was absolutely drowned

298
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:01,942
into fanatic ideas about religion.

299
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:07,566
If Freud was there he would have said,

300
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:11,359
"oh this is all nonsense" you see, "What's wrong? Go ahead."

301
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,275
Krishna did not do that.

302
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:22,983
He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles

303
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:30,025
of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism.

304
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:35,067
But He did it in a very beautiful manner

305
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:39,067
keeping the relationship absolutely pure.

306
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:44,359
Now people ask questions,

307
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,858
"Mother, was He married to Radha?"

308
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,775
You know He's eternally married to Her, doesn't matter.

309
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:53,608
But He actually performed the marriage

310
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:59,775
just the day He was born. He was brought by His father

311
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:04,858
across the river and put down on the bank of the river,

312
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,359
when Shri Brahmadeva himself came on this earth.

313
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,359
That's why He wears a yellow thing, always,

314
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,359
as a blessing from Brahmadeva to cover His lower part,

315
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:23,733
lower than the waist with a cloth. That's the sign.

316
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:26,525
That's why He always wears yellow.

317
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:34,775
He himself came, made Him into man and married Him to Radhaji.

318
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:43,192
Then again He became a child just to appear to be a child.

319
00:25:43,192 --> 00:25:45,483
Somebody may appear to be a child.

320
00:25:45,483 --> 00:25:48,109
To some of you I appear to you to be a sixteen-year-old girl

321
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,400
as you say, but I'm not.

322
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:54,817
While I may be, according to counting,

323
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:58,192
might be sixty years of age, but I'm not.

324
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:04,733
My age is eternal. I can't say what age is Mine.

325
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:11,441
It could be two years old or it could be absolutelyancient.

326
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:13,566
It could be anything.

327
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:21,942
So in His whole life, whatever He did,

328
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:25,359
He did with the purity of understanding.

329
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:28,109
So Radhaji was married to Him first.

330
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:35,317
And afterwards when He came as a child,

331
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,400
when He was a child, He did all kinds of pranks and things.

332
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:43,109
It was nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

333
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,608
It was not sitting like this and seriously telling about things.

334
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,109
But with little bit here and there

335
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:56,650
He tried to improve their chakras and raise their Kundalinis.

336
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,359
Of course realization was not possible in a game.

337
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,983
You cannot do it. Supposing I just play about with you

338
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,858
you cannot get your realization

339
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,359
because at the Sahastrara stage

340
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,900
you have to completely recognize.

341
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:24,400
It has to be a game of serenity.

342
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:29,608
Of course, you can just raise your hand

343
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,150
and give realization to people.

344
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,942
But you have to bring them to serene level.

345
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:39,566
If you just came andsaid, "alright, you now play about",

346
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:41,900
it would be all finished.

347
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,942
You have to sit down and meditate.

348
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:47,483
Though He has said it in Geeta you have to do it.

349
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:52,067
So one could not say that all the time if you are playing,

350
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,150
if you are just singing songs,

351
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:00,025
or if you are in a very happy mood, a mirthful mood,

352
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,067
then it's the end of Sahaja Yoga. It is not.

353
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:06,067
It's a serious matter.

354
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:10,317
So He did not give them realization

355
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:13,317
but He reduced the tension on their minds

356
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:19,858
of the so-called dharma and its shackles of fanaticism

357
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:24,650
and He made it loose and then He wanted them

358
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,025
to understand that dharma is not

359
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:32,525
going to enslave you.

360
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:34,525
You have to rise above the dharma --

361
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:38,942
become dharma itself.

362
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:51,900
But Yogeshwara is to be worshipped with pure heart.

363
00:28:51,942 --> 00:29:00,566
In this atmosphere it''s difficult, I know.

364
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:05,025
You just go out and you see a horrid thing there.

365
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,608
You open any page of the magazine,

366
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,483
there''s another horrid thing. Anywhere you advertise Me

367
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,608
the next page I turn I find a discotheque nonsense

368
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,817
going on there. I mean what can you do,

369
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:22,150
you just can't help it. And all this is on, I mean,

370
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:27,441
if you look at it - how gross, dirty, filthy the whole thing is.

371
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:32,733
To add to problems, psychologists have come forward.

372
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:37,150
They themselves are affected by their methods

373
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,192
and everything, they are so possessed

374
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:46,650
and their sense about morality is absolutely in complete confusion.

375
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,109
No doubt about it.

376
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,234
You know Freud, what happened to him?

377
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,566
He was having relations with his mother.

378
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,733
He couldn't even understand, I mean imagine

379
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,858
what a adharmi he must be, horrible wretched fellow,

380
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,775
he did not even have that purity to understand

381
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:04,234
relationship with a mother. I mean, imagine.

382
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:08,067
It is such a clear-cut background of this man.

383
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:10,942
Shows how wrong he must have been.

384
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:16,150
Because what was in him, such filth, such dirt,

385
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:21,817
that he could not even look at his mother with clear heart.

386
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:25,858
Must be all mud in his eyes or I don't know what he be like,

387
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,275
to see things like that.

388
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:36,109
You are shaking with my vibrations already.

389
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:42,566
Now when we think of Him as Yogeshwara

390
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:46,566
that means we are Yogis and He is our Ishwara.

391
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:55,691
Ishwara is to be praised - Dhayaati??

392
00:30:55,733 --> 00:31:03,483
you have to praise Him. You have to praise Him

393
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:09,441
for his quality as Yogeshwara because He is your Ishwara

394
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,399
so you have to praise Him.

395
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,359
Now what praise can we give Him.

396
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,359
Today He's born. What should we do

397
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,733
on such a great occasion when He is born?

398
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:32,067
We have to decide that He is our Ishwara.

399
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:40,067
He is the Ishwara aspect and if He is our Ishwara

400
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:48,150
then we have to cleanse our attitude towards sex,

401
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:57,275
towards the gross way of life that we have developed,

402
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:03,025
to just shun it and throw it away. Absolutely.

403
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,067
There cannot be compromise on that

404
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:15,150
otherwise you cannot be a yogi, you cannot be a yogi.

405
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:19,317
You may become very powerful, maybe for the time being.

406
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,608
Because I play with you, you get ideas

407
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:25,817
that you are very powerful and all that. But that's not true.

408
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:32,150
As My name is Nirmala, as My name is purity --

409
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,109
you have to be pure yogis.

410
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:41,109
Nobody says you should not marry.

411
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:44,400
Nobody says you should not have proper sex relationships

412
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:47,399
with you wives, that's not done.

413
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,942
But that's one thing people may avoid and spoil it.

414
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:58,691
But the other thing, which is the most important, is your attention

415
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:06,566
to be pure of sex attractions [of] any kind.

416
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:11,234
Your attention should never go to anything like that.

417
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:24,775
You see to Me, I mean I'm now supposed to be an old lady, I don't see things

418
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:28,942
which normally people see. This is something surprising.

419
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:32,192
You see, I see something and I don't know what's happening

420
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:34,691
and everybody laughs at me in the house you see.

421
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:37,483
They don't understand that - how I didn't see the point.

422
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,691
But I don't understand these jokes

423
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:42,817
because the attention never goes into these dirty things,

424
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:45,983
never goes into these things. I can't see,

425
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,441
till somebody tells me that 'this is this.'

426
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,817
But they have to explain ten times.

427
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:57,025
So all these sophisticated methods of nonsense

428
00:33:57,025 --> 00:34:02,441
and the filth and the dirt that we have accumulated here,

429
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,525
please wash off your hands of that.

430
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:09,483
That's one thing, will not be tolerated in Sahaja Yoga.

431
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,109
Every Sahaja Yogi I must tell.

432
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:18,109
Itself, sex cannot be enjoyed, if you live like this.

433
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,817
You cannot! You don't enjoy sex at all in this country.

434
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:24,192
None of them.

435
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:26,650
Only in a country, where people are innocent,

436
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,025
you can enjoy. If you were enjoying,

437
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,067
you would not run from one woman to another woman,

438
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:33,733
you would not run from man to woman and man to man

439
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,983
and then to all donkeys all those things.

440
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:44,817
It is impossible that you could be a yogi

441
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,775
with all these dirty ideas.

442
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:54,441
And then you cannot mature,

443
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,441
even a normal person won't mature.

444
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,566
In India a person who is about 40 years,

445
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,733
he becomes a matured father.

446
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:03,067
You leave any girls with him, anybody with him,

447
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,983
it will not even get into his head

448
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:08,150
that there's something could exist between them.

449
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,109
Once you are married it should not.

450
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,942
I mean I have seen my two son-inlaws,

451
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:14,150
they never get these ideas into their heads.

452
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:25,483
So try to put your attention onto proper track

453
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,691
because your Ishwara is Yogeshwara.

454
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:31,566
Now the other side of Shri Krishna

455
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,775
people do not know.

456
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:38,192
It's a play, all right. But He is Samhara-shakti.

457
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:45,983
He is the power of destruction. It's very good,

458
00:35:45,983 --> 00:35:49,983
He's there, comes with everything to protect us.

459
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:55,150
But He also has got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan,

460
00:35:55,192 --> 00:36:00,234
'su' means auspicious, "darshan" is vision.

461
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:04,234
He gives us auspicious visions, you see.

462
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:09,234
If you try tricks with Him, that goes round your neck

463
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:14,942
and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself,

464
00:36:14,983 --> 00:36:17,775
that you are hanging in the air somewhere.

465
00:36:17,817 --> 00:36:24,192
So Shri Krishna's methods; on one side

466
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:30,691
He is a "Leelamayi", He is compassionate,

467
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:36,775
He stands by His bhaktas, He comes on this earth

468
00:36:36,817 --> 00:36:42,399
to revive the dharma. If the dharma goes down,

469
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:47,192
He comes to uplift it. "Yada yada hi dharmasya" --

470
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:50,317
"whenever there is the decline of dharma."

471
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,109
But dharma doesn't mean only corruption,

472
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:55,942
it doesn't mean only honesty and dishonesty.

473
00:36:55,983 --> 00:37:01,733
Basically it means Mooladhara.

474
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:07,109
That is the beginning of the end.

475
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:11,608
And He comes to - "sa sansthapana arthaya" --

476
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:16,858
again to establish into the holy state.

477
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,400
He comes on this earth to raise human beings to that level.

478
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:37,566
This is what He does. So if we are Sahaja Yogis,

479
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:41,775
we are part and parcel of His Being.

480
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:48,900
We are instruments into His working.

481
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:52,483
So we have to establish dharma, but the one,

482
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:54,817
who has no dharma within himself,

483
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:58,150
what dharma is he going to establish anywhere?

484
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:04,025
You have come on this earth to establish the dharma

485
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:09,192
in its holy aspect. Not like Roman Catholic church

486
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:12,399
or another Pentecostal church

487
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,691
or these Hindu religious activities

488
00:38:17,691 --> 00:38:19,733
or these Hindu temples

489
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,399
or the Islamic state.

490
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:27,109
But dharma in its pure state you have to establish.

491
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,900
But if there is no dharma within us,

492
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,025
how are we going to establish?

493
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:35,691
So He comes on this earth every time

494
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:38,900
to establish dharma at Vishnu level.

495
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,234
But at Shri Krishna level, He comes at Yogeshwara.

496
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:47,691
This is the point many people have not even thought out.

497
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,441
For Vishnu they may not say Yogeshwara.

498
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:56,234
That is He is the Ishwara of Yogis,

499
00:38:56,234 --> 00:39:10,483
as Ganesha is the Ishwara of the Ganas.

500
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:17,608
You see, it's the Ganapati [who] looks after the Ganas,

501
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,983
and He is our Ishwara.

502
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:27,441
That is we have to have Him as our ideal.

503
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:33,150
With the understanding that today is the day --

504
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:35,817
in the night about 12 o'clock,

505
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:39,566
now must be about 12 o'clock in India also, about that,

506
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:51,441
so it matches - He was born at this time in the night,

507
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:55,775
because it was real night symbolically,

508
00:39:55,817 --> 00:40:00,900
under horrible circumstances.

509
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:07,775
He came, at a time,

510
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:15,608
when His own birth was very dangerously placed.

511
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,900
He was saved, and then, in His very childhood

512
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:33,359
He killed Rakshasas. But all this He did

513
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:34,942
because He was an incarnation.

514
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:38,399
Nobody is asking you to go and kill Rakshasas. Is it?

515
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,483
In Sahaja Yoga did I ask you to go and kill some Rakshasas?

516
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:46,025
On the contrary I'm just saying -keep yourself protected.

517
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:53,942
There was a Rakshasin who came, her name was Putana

518
00:40:53,942 --> 00:41:01,067
and she wanted to put poison through her breast

519
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:05,275
and she took the child and started nursing.

520
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:09,566
He was a little baby. And when He started sucking her breast,

521
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:18,150
she came out in her true form and she died.

522
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:23,983
Because He was, after all, He was an incarnation.

523
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,192
Can anyone of us do that?

524
00:41:28,775 --> 00:41:30,025
I mean the Sahaja Yogis?

525
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:37,275
Then as a child He was very mischievous.

526
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:47,067
He ate some clay, I think.

527
00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:50,150
Whether He ate it or not, His mother doubted.

528
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:52,067
She got very angry and she said:

529
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,983
"Open your mouth, I would like to see, did you eat that?"

530
00:41:54,983 --> 00:41:57,817
When He opened the mouth - she saw a complete universe

531
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:04,608
moving in His throat - because Vishuddhi chakra She saw.

532
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,234
Because she could see. She had power to see, she could see.

533
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,900
Not...everybody can't see that.

534
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:16,150
Those who have powers can see.

535
00:42:16,192 --> 00:42:21,359
We don't even have the powers as much as she had

536
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,608
to see the universe.

537
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:32,359
So one has to understand that first, as Sahaja Yogis,

538
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,400
we get the powers much before we have passed,

539
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,067
really, the test of Sahaja Yogis.

540
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,109
Just the other way round it is.

541
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,400
In the university they will first give you the degree,

542
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,858
the certificate and then you will get a job,

543
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,858
may not get job also, these days!

544
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,317
Here you get the job first of all, you get all the powers

545
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:12,109
you are paid for, but the degree is still not sure.

546
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,858
Anybody walks about as Sahaja Yogi,

547
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,858
next day I find him coming out with something else.

548
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,983
They are certified Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

549
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:33,483
They become afterwards certified something else.

550
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:37,608
God knows how. So this is the thing of Sahaja Yoga

551
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,317
that you can become a Sahaja Yogi

552
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:44,317
even without having the real certificate.

553
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:49,983
It's definitely so. And the certificate is given,

554
00:43:50,025 --> 00:43:52,608
as you know, by Lord Jesus Christ.

555
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:57,608
He doesn't give certificate easily.

556
00:43:57,608 --> 00:44:02,900
That way He is very, very strict.

557
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:08,483
He is not going to give you. He''s extremely strict

558
00:44:08,525 --> 00:44:11,775
as far as the Sahaja Yogis are concerned,

559
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:13,775
He''s not going to give you certificates,

560
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:19,150
He's going to judge you. And what is His basic nature, is He's innocence.

561
00:44:19,192 --> 00:44:23,525
He is going to judge you on your innocence.

562
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:27,608
If you are a superego you can say,

563
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,400
Oh I got possessed by a bhoot, you see,

564
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:32,400
and the bhoot did this. So He will say:

565
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:36,441
"Alright you go to the bhoot for the certificate not to me."

566
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:40,608
Even when Yogis fight, I've seen, they tell me,

567
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,733
"Mother, must be my bhoot and his bhoot must have fought".

568
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:45,900
And what were you doing?

569
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:54,400
They were witnessing it like Shri Krishnas!

570
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:59,192
With all these things happening,

571
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:10,525
I get a big promise sometimes, that, "Mother, alright,

572
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:13,359
now we are not going to quarrel,

573
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,192
there's not going to be any problem, you rest assured,

574
00:45:18,234 --> 00:45:24,733
we'll all live in harmony." Then suddenly I find

575
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:27,275
that somebody is fighting for a bathroom

576
00:45:27,317 --> 00:45:30,566
or for a soap or something like that.

577
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:34,525
That's not for a Sahaja Yogi to behave.

578
00:45:34,525 --> 00:45:40,359
First of all you have to be a satisfied person,

579
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:45,691
a person of great dignity and forbearance,

580
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:49,317
otherwise what are you going to bear?

581
00:45:49,317 --> 00:46:01,566
"I love him very much, but he should not have taken my towel."

582
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:07,691
For small, small things if you go on insisting,

583
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:15,150
be sure you are not a yogi as yet.

584
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,192
If you are fighting for things,

585
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,983
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

586
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,441
What do these things matter?

587
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:25,025
I never say anything about anything, do I?

588
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:27,150
That "I must have this, I must have that,

589
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,775
how did you prepare this?"

590
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:31,525
Though it is sometimes really wrong and unprotocolish.

591
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:34,275
I never say that, "Why did you bring these bananas,

592
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:37,858
they are no good, I'm not going to eat!" Did I say so?

593
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,733
I mean, even the flowers you use may not be auspicious.

594
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,608
I know certain flowers should not be used for puja.

595
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,608
But I have not opened my mouth. If I have to tell you,

596
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:51,691
I just tell you because you have to know it

597
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:56,025
for your own good, not for my good.

598
00:46:56,067 --> 00:47:04,109
So, on a day like this, which is a day of great joy

599
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,817
to all the world, and happiness,

600
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:11,192
you should know one thing, that, when Christ was born,

601
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:14,608
he was born in a very humble place,

602
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,858
but when Krishna was born,

603
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:25,317
He was born in the most horrifying circumstances.

604
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:31,775
Same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today.

605
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:34,441
It's a thing of great joy and jubilation, no doubt,

606
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:37,441
that He came and he gave us His Vishuddi power,

607
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,359
but we must understand that we are born

608
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:42,942
in a very precarious time.

609
00:47:42,983 --> 00:47:46,025
I've been saying this so many times.

610
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:49,942
There''s not only one Kamsa there. So many are there.

611
00:47:49,942 --> 00:47:52,566
There''s a big fight going on,

612
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:55,817
in that you people are here in charge.

613
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:59,775
You are the ones employed by God, you are the ones,

614
00:47:59,775 --> 00:48:07,983
who have been given this great work. You have powers.

615
00:48:08,025 --> 00:48:10,400
Like Shri Krishna, when He was crossing,

616
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,858
as a child was put in a basket

617
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,650
and the father was carrying the child in the basket

618
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:20,067
and when His feet touched the river Yamuna,

619
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:22,317
the river went down.

620
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:24,858
Because she was in spate, she went down.

621
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,566
In the same way, you too have all these powers.

622
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:31,359
Krishna has given you all the powers.

623
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:35,775
Though they will be really known to you,

624
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:42,359
when only Lord Jesus Christ accepts you as Sahaja Yogis.

625
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:48,399
That's important because you have to be innocent.

626
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,275
Purity must be brought in.

627
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:57,566
Last time on this great day we had 16 marriages.

628
00:48:57,566 --> 00:49:00,608
They came out well most of them.

629
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:05,067
Not all, but most of them were very good

630
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,983
and I am really very happy

631
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:10,483
that such good couples came on that day.

632
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:12,067
It was very auspicious.

633
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:21,650
And marriage gives you a sense of purity

634
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:29,525
and that's why our marriage is important in Sahaja Yoga.

635
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:33,691
But that's not the last word, like this is not

636
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:35,525
a hunting ground for everyone,

637
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,608
"I'm finding out this husband or I'm finding out that husband."

638
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,275
That must be stopped completely. Leave it to Sahaja.

639
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:46,234
You are not to search out your wives in Sahaja Yogis,

640
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:49,400
no, not at all, nor husbands! Leave it!

641
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:57,483
If you have done something like that, then you may be harmed.

642
00:49:57,483 --> 00:50:00,817
Don't do any searching or any thing.

643
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:04,733
A time will come, when you will find,

644
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,900
I will myself tell you "alright, marry this person."

645
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:10,775
It's still on among Sahaja Yogis, I have known people

646
00:50:10,817 --> 00:50:14,775
who just take out people and try courting.

647
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:17,817
That's not needed in Sahaja Yoga, no courting needed.

648
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,525
See, we have got so many cases,

649
00:50:19,566 --> 00:50:21,317
where the marriage was decided like that,

650
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,192
they married, they are very happily married,

651
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:25,983
than people who had courting, this thing, selections,

652
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:29,775
and nominations and elections and everything.

653
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:35,317
And after that you find within 2 days they are out for divorce.

654
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:39,608
In Sahaja Yoga it is spontaneous,instantaneous.

655
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:43,234
You don't have to do all these things

656
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:45,942
with all these deliberations what have you achieved?

657
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:50,441
It's just spontaneous. So you don't have to worry

658
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:53,399
and you don't have to think. You don't have to say,

659
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,942
that "Oh Mother, I have to find a girl for me"

660
00:50:55,983 --> 00:51:00,525
You see, you don't! Leave it me, it's my headache.

661
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:04,234
But once you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

662
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:06,566
you must know what it means.

663
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,234
And both of you must work it out properly

664
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,691
and it is for the good of everyone.

665
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:20,900
Should be good for everyone.

666
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:33,317
So, this is what it is. And I would say that, on this day,

667
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,317
let us take one vow:

668
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:06,192
To decide that we will be worshippingYogeshwara.

669
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:08,067
We have to worship Him.

670
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:14,858
Means our relationships about these things has to be clean.

671
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:18,983
We should not get involved into it, it''s nothing important.

672
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:23,525
It's just like having your food,

673
00:52:23,566 --> 00:52:31,983
you have to be with your wife. Is the need of the body.

674
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:44,900
You don't eat from the dirty plates, do you?

675
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,109
You want to have a clean plate.

676
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:51,566
You want to have a plate, which you have used yourself,

677
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:56,399
your own plate that should be clean.

678
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,275
If you could have a cleaner plate, you would like to have,

679
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:01,359
if you can get a silver plate, you would like.

680
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:04,983
If it is even a golden plate is even better.

681
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:09,025
In the same way, we should also have

682
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:15,400
a very pure understanding that, it is the need of the body,

683
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,275
the body which can be very subtle.

684
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:26,399
So let us not just go on shopping for it everywhere,

685
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,650
looking out, "oh this is that, this one that one,"

686
00:53:28,691 --> 00:53:37,317
then discard this one. It has to come to you specially.

687
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,109
And all great things happen suddenly. Always.

688
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:51,317
The more deliberations you will have, the worse it will be.

689
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:58,775
So don't form ideas, don't plan about it.

690
00:53:58,817 --> 00:54:02,234
It will happen. It''s not so important.

691
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:09,483
That will give you a lot of purity. Your ego will be perfect.

692
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:16,691
I know of someone, whom nobody wanted to marry.

693
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:21,400
And when I suggested someone,

694
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:24,275
who agreed with great difficulty, she said,

695
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:34,441
"I don't want to marry." It's funny. It is very funny that,

696
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:36,983
the way our ego is working out. Because, you see,

697
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:40,691
when we are looking at another person for marriage or anything,

698
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:43,317
we are not thinking of Yogeshwara.

699
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:45,942
We don't think that it is Yogeshwara,

700
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:48,566
who will do everything for us, we are thinking,

701
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:51,650
we have to do it. Alright, so we go ahead with this,

702
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:58,150
that, and spoil our attention completely.

703
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,983
""Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

704
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:09,275
In this part of your decision, if you can leave it to God,

705
00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:17,525
it would be better. I tell you, if you can do that,

706
00:55:17,525 --> 00:55:21,691
you have crossed your ego half way through.

707
00:55:21,733 --> 00:55:27,109
Because at least 50% ego is used in this.

708
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:29,942
In the West especially.

709
00:55:29,942 --> 00:55:33,067
In India this question doesn't arise much.

710
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:38,399
Because the parents can't decide here, nobody can decide,

711
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,650
you have to decide yourself. It's a big responsibility

712
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,109
and a big thing for you.

713
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,067
So 50% of your ego problem will be finished,

714
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:56,858
I tell you, once you just give up this responsibility

715
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:08,525
of choosing a bride or a bridegroom for yourself. Just forget it.

716
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:15,234
Such a waste of energy, I tell you.

717
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:21,900
When I see people, young people, doing all these things

718
00:56:21,942 --> 00:56:25,441
I wish they could understand the value of their lives,

719
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:32,275
the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna.

720
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:43,234
He''s not Ishwara of everyone, only of yogis.

721
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,150
Anybody else who tries to say

722
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:49,441
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" will get throat cancer.

723
00:56:49,483 --> 00:56:55,025
Anybody who tries to call Him

724
00:56:55,067 --> 00:57:02,400
who is not a yogi gets a problem in the throat, you know.

725
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:13,900
So He is only available to you, He is only your Ishwara.

726
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:22,817
He manifests only for you. He is your own.

727
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:28,525
He won't act for any Dick, Tom and Harry.

728
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:30,483
Maybe you might be a prime minister,

729
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:33,566
you might be a king or queen, it makes no difference to him.

730
00:57:33,608 --> 00:57:38,817
To him only a yogi, only a yogi can call him.

731
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:42,983
Only a yogi can ask for his help.

732
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:46,359
He is not bothered about anybody else.

733
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:55,691
And if a yogi recommends, then only He can look after someone.

734
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:59,359
Otherwise He will not bother about him.

735
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:12,983
So He is actually your own king, who is always there,

736
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:20,234
looking after you. When you call Him,

737
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:27,775
He comes with all His powers to support you.

738
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:35,067
But you have to be a yogi. If you are not a yogi,

739
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:41,608
which is of course certified by Lord Jesus Christ,

740
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,858
then Krishna has nothing to do with you.

741
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,399
So before the entry to Shri Krishna,

742
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:52,192
though He is not the one who is going to judge your innocence,

743
00:58:52,192 --> 00:58:59,566
in the door resides Lord Jesus Christ.

744
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:02,858
When you get in, then it's all right.

745
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:09,483
But to get in, also is difficult because He''s always throwing you out.

746
00:59:09,483 --> 00:59:18,650
Shri Krishna has said, that "You will be the ...",

747
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:23,817
to Jesus, He said, "You will be the Adhara, the support of the universe."

748
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:26,441
Means the innocence is your support, innocence.

749
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:29,192
If that innocence is not established in you,

750
00:59:29,234 --> 00:59:36,399
then Shri Krishna cannot help you. He is helpless.

751
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,192
Because you don't become a yogi and

752
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:44,067
so He''s not your Ishwara any more.

753
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:47,399
Now one may say that, "Mother the Agnya chakra

754
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:51,942
is here and He is here," Alright,

755
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:59,234
but Agnya chakra when you cross, here he is.

756
00:59:59,275 --> 01:00:05,942
When, you cross your Agnya chakra,

757
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:10,399
that means He is sitting there and the Virata is sitting here.

758
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:17,650
So unless and until you pass your Agnya Chakra

759
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:23,025
properly, you can't get to Virat.

760
01:00:23,025 --> 01:00:27,067
And Yogeshwara is the Virat.

761
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:34,983
That is the aspect we have to worship, we have to worship!

762
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:39,775
Worshipping doesn't mean that you become that person.

763
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:42,691
You worship Me, you don't become Me.

764
01:00:42,691 --> 01:00:45,275
What do you do, when you worship?

765
01:00:45,317 --> 01:00:51,483
You surrender all that is not liked by Me,

766
01:00:51,525 --> 01:01:05,566
in the fire, in the water, outside. In the elements you throw them away.

767
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:11,608
And you bring to Me your heart. That''s what it is, worshipping.

768
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,150
In the same way we have to worship the aspect

769
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:21,400
of Shri Krishna in me, which is Yogeshwara.

770
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,608
I am Yogeshwara.

771
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:28,025
Things do not come into My head at all,

772
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:30,359
I don't see things like that.

773
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,817
I don't know what is temptation is, what attraction is,

774
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:37,192
I just don't understand. On the contrary

775
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:41,359
these things repel me, repel absolutely, I vomit.

776
01:01:41,399 --> 01:01:47,025
Even to hear these things, I don't want to open My ears,

777
01:01:47,025 --> 01:01:51,275
My ears become deaf. I can't hear these things.

778
01:01:51,317 --> 01:01:53,900
I can't understand any dirty jokes.

779
01:01:53,942 --> 01:01:57,150
I have no brains [for this]. My brains refuse to understand.

780
01:01:57,192 --> 01:02:06,775
I become a dull person, absolutely. Deaf and dumb.

781
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:09,483
People have written books and books on these things,

782
01:02:09,483 --> 01:02:11,150
I don't know what they must be writing.

783
01:02:11,192 --> 01:02:14,109
What is there to write on this?

784
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:21,608
So today we have to know that our personal life

785
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:24,983
has to be extremely clean.

786
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:27,608
We face ourselves every moment

787
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:29,650
and find out within ourselves --

788
01:02:29,691 --> 01:02:33,150
are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves

789
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:39,109
who resides within us? Let us develop that purity.

790
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:45,025
Then innocence will be established in our eyes.

791
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:49,359
We'll be innocent. The eyes will speak of innocence.

792
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,192
What's the use of having eyes,

793
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:56,858
which are all the time shifting,

794
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:59,150
you don't know where they are going, wobbling eyes,

795
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,150
you see, like this, like this, like this.

796
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,900
You can't trust these eyes at all.

797
01:03:03,942 --> 01:03:09,691
But the eyes, which are innocent,

798
01:03:09,733 --> 01:03:18,399
receive nothing they just give. They just give.

799
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,900
Innocence is very penetrating, very purifying,

800
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:32,109
very soothing and very beautiful.

801
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:39,775
We have to become beautiful people.

802
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:46,483
Today I said on these things

803
01:03:46,483 --> 01:03:53,025
because I'm sometimes disturbed the way people

804
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:58,900
don't understand that purity of sex life

805
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:03,192
is so important to Sahaja Yoga, especially in the West.

806
01:04:03,192 --> 01:04:06,733
People don't understand.

807
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:11,234
To Indians this lecture has no meaning, they will think,

808
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:13,733
"Why Mother is wasting Her energy so much?"

809
01:04:13,775 --> 01:04:16,275
Because they don't understand.

810
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:22,067
But to Me it is very important here.

811
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:30,900
Whatever I have seen and heard and see all around.

812
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:37,650
I think today's message should be of Yogeshwara.

813
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:42,025
Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

814
01:04:42,067 --> 01:04:43,983
When you worship Me today,

815
01:04:44,025 --> 01:04:49,441
it should be the worship of Yogeshwara and nothing else.

816
01:04:49,441 --> 01:04:53,525
May God bless you.
