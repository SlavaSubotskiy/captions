1
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:04,614
First, I’ll speak in English language,

2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:10,536
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

3
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:12,942
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

4
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:18,161
and also from Kerala,

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:22,778
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,801
All these people have come here,

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,082
and I don’t know what other people are here,

8
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:34,707
who have come from South

9
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:42,048
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

10
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:57,125
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

11
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:00,755
because

12
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:11,242
there is so much –

13
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:16,656
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

14
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:23,226
such horrible news is there

15
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:29,249
about the people who are trying to create

16
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,765
all kinds of violence, corruption

17
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:41,609
and immoral behaviour.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:50,122
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

19
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:55,250
all these criminalities going round us.

20
00:01:56,528 --> 00:02:03,321
This is the time, as if come, for

21
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:09,813
the “Taandav nrtya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

22
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:15,508
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

23
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,727
It is His anger, if it starts,

24
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:27,211
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

25
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:34,216
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

26
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,874
He’s a God who is full of love,

27
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:45,460
full of tremendous compassion,

28
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:58,823
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

29
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:02,628
He can destroy the whole world.

30
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:10,954
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

31
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:16,069
if He gets into a temper.

32
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,930
You all must be knowing the story,

33
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:29,287
how He went into ecstasy.

34
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:35,806
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,408
And a mother cannot kill the child,

36
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:43,406
she cannot. And She thought

37
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:53,106
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

38
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:57,301
or anger of Shiva

39
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:03,293
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

40
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:15,006
So She withdrew from Her act

41
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:22,553
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

42
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:27,561
and it was Shiva who took over.

43
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:34,359
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,336
That child was a devil.

45
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:42,227
And so, He saved the world

46
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:47,336
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

47
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:51,219
And then He danced with joy.

48
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,529
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

49
00:04:58,053 --> 00:05:00,494
Many people don’t understand why

50
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,799
He’s standing on top of a little child,

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,237
but the reason was this.

52
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:11,081
So, even people may camouflage today

53
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:16,964
as small children, as very innocent people,

54
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:26,385
as very holy gurus,

55
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:30,785
Shiva can destroy all of them.

56
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:34,894
This destruction has already started

57
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:39,878
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

58
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,191
through so many things that are happening:

59
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:50,586
we have got hurricanes,

60
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:55,359
storms, earthquakes,

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,054
many accidents,

62
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:02,312
and so many destructive things are working out

63
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:07,734
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

64
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,492
But, at the same time,

65
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:15,656
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

66
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:19,625
is the resurrection of the people.

67
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:23,305
Such people can never be hurt,

68
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:26,578
nothing can happen to them.

69
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:29,172
They’ll be always saved.

70
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:31,891
Everything will be saved for them

71
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:37,396
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

72
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:44,391
Now the problem is

73
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:50,610
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

74
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:57,834
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

75
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:04,355
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

76
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:09,207
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

77
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:13,824
who are even very bad and gone cases,

78
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:19,652
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

79
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:23,332
and they’ll become good people.

80
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:31,543
They will stop all this horrible things they are thinking

81
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,246
and planning in their heads

82
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:39,785
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

83
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:43,004
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

84
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,949
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

85
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,004
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

86
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,785
and keep themselves in complete peace

87
00:07:55,986 --> 00:08:01,738
and also completely surrendered,

88
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,566
nothing can happen to them.

89
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,691
They are always protected and you all have an experience

90
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:12,214
of that protection.

91
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:16,402
But first you should have faith in yourself

92
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:21,222
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:25,488
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

94
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:29,957
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

95
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,410
and also from other foreign countries.

96
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:39,684
Every country is, today, under the,

97
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:44,082
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

98
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:49,543
What we have to do is to make people positive

99
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:54,215
through Kundalini awakening. This you all can do.

100
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,416
This you can achieve.

101
00:08:56,617 --> 00:09:01,299
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

102
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,643
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

103
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:10,784
This is the only thing that is needed today,

104
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:15,245
is to transform people and you all can do it,

105
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:23,174
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

106
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:28,682
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

107
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,143
get angry with rude people,

108
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:35,807
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

109
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:43,333
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

110
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:47,458
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

111
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,614
That’s something horrible.

112
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,177
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

113
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:57,349
extremely in a constructive manner.

114
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,107
So what we should do is to, first of all,

115
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:11,006
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

116
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:14,436
principle of love

117
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:19,051
and principle of Truth, I should say.

118
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,897
There are big problems, also,

119
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:26,741
because people have no idea

120
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:34,582
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

121
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,727
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

122
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:47,513
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

123
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:52,125
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

124
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:57,576
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

125
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:04,094
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

126
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:07,117
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

127
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,797
I can’t understand.

128
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:14,563
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

129
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:20,813
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

130
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,376
 if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

131
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:32,259
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

132
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,501
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

133
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:42,993
And She rises through the channel

134
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:49,188
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

135
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:54,899
So how can you do away with one of Them?

136
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,516
One is the road, another is the destination.

137
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:03,704
So I hope you understand how important it is

138
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:07,267
that your centers should be corrected,

139
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:10,642
your road should be alright,

140
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:13,814
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

141
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:17,431
because we are “madhyamargis”:

142
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:20,619
we have to go by the centre,

143
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,275
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

144
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:29,416
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

145
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:32,338
This balance we must keep

146
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,080
and go on moving until you reach

147
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:40,460
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

148
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:45,590
You can experience it, you
can see for yourself.

149
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,410
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

150
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:55,269
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

151
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,316
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

152
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:06,360
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

153
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:11,699
The truth which is absolute.

154
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,418
This is also the principle which starts showing results

155
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:22,853
when these two powers meet.

156
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,493
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

157
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:34,220
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

158
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:38,368
then you realize

159
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:45,040
that these two powers are so complimentary

160
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:52,858
and so much related to each other.

161
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:57,535
There’s no difference, in a way,

162
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,923
between these two powers.

163
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,850
And, so, keep your

164
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,532
road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

165
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:10,548
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

166
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,017
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

167
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:20,876
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

168
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,384
is going through the Vishnu path

169
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:28,741
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.
