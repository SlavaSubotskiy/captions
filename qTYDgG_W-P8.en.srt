1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,460
of course I've told you about the brown

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,460
now you have become the chicken

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,380
making so many eggs everyday

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,520
you study something like our birthday we

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,629
said when we became a bird out of the

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,610
cheese Michelle

7
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:52,769
so Easter is our birthday we are selling

8
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:58,739
out of our realization and every day we

9
00:00:52,769 --> 00:01:02,100
must grow with our birthday why in a

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,259
human form you decrease your age as your

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,759
birthday comes in

12
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:11,280
but with this we increase your range and

13
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,369
you're proud that you are growing and

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,200
the human level you feel unhappy that

15
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,869
you are going here you feel proud that

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,660
you are going just the opposite of what

17
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:30,420
you are doing if you try to do it it

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:32,910
will be nice I mean that doesn't mean

19
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,720
bugging indiscreet you know I am quite

20
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:41,119
worried on that point discretion is the

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,119
first thing that you should have before
