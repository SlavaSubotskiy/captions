1
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:28,332
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

2
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:34,832
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

3
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:43,832
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

4
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:48,832
finished Her work

5
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:53,832
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

6
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:59,332
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

7
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:08,332
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

8
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:20,332
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

9
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:28,332
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

10
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:33,332
which is the Power of Desire.

11
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:38,332
But all these powers are nothing

12
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:45,332
but the power of God’s love.

13
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:56,332
So, in the series of this great love of God,

14
00:21:56,332 --> 00:22:02,332
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

15
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:03,332
In the same way,

16
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:08,332
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

17
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:13,332
have to have full desire in their heart.

18
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:20,332
Desire to love.

19
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:27,332
That desire is very different from

20
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:32,332
the other kinds of human love we have known.

21
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:36,332
In other kinds of human love,

22
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:39,332
when we have relations with others,

23
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:43,332
we have expectations,

24
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:49,332
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

25
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:53,332
Our expectations always run higher

26
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:59,332
than our understanding and realities.

27
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:04,332
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

28
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:10,832
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

29
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:14,832
becomes a thankless job.

30
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:19,832
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

31
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:24,832
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

32
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:28,832
not to love others.

33
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:31,832
Everyone should love you,

34
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:35,832
but how far you love another is the point.

35
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,832
Naturally everyone for oneself!

36
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:41,832
So really nobody loves.

37
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:46,832
But when it comes to real love

38
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:52,832
then sacrifice becomes a nature.

39
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,832
You don’t call it a sacrifice but you call it a privilege.

40
00:23:56,832 --> 00:24:01,832
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

41
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:06,832
It’s a great chance that we can love.

42
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:11,832
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

43
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:16,832
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

44
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:22,832
So the giving starts when you realise,

45
00:24:22,832 --> 00:24:26,832
not understand but realise the love,

46
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,832
the power of love expressing .

47
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:34,832
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

48
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,832
Because, after this,

49
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:40,832
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

50
00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:44,832
That’s how the action of

51
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:49,832
achieving that state of giving love starts.

52
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:53,832
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

53
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:59,832
As I said, we start expecting

54
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:06,832
and thinking that we are loving others.

55
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:10,832
We act for that.

56
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:14,832
In that madness that others should love us,

57
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:16,832
others should respect us,

58
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,832
others should think we are great,

59
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:20,832
they should recognise us

60
00:25:20,832 --> 00:25:25,832
we start loving something else which is not so important.

61
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:30,832
So, we go on first to money,

62
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,832
money becomes a very important point.

63
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:39,832
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

64
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:43,832
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

65
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,832
as rich people.

66
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,832
So we start accumulating money,

67
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:55,832
we start loving the money.

68
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:58,832
But money is not the Truth;

69
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,832
we don’t love the Truth.

70
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,832
When we start loving the money

71
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:06,832
we start thinking about problems of money.

72
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:14,832
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

73
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:17,832
that even towards God they become miserly.

74
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:18,832
They never have money actually,

75
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:21,832
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

76
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:26,832
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

77
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,832
That’s how they have problems

78
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:36,832
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

79
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:42,832
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

80
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:47,832
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

81
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,832
They want to have the power;

82
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:52,832
they want to become presidents,

83
00:26:52,982 --> 00:26:57,832
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

84
00:26:57,832 --> 00:27:00,832
They want to have the power:

85
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,832
they think by having great power

86
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,832
people will respect them and love them.

87
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:10,832
But they get drowned in fear.

88
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:14,832
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

89
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,832
Also moneyed people have fear.

90
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:23,832
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

91
00:27:23,832 --> 00:27:28,832
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

92
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:32,832
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

93
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:38,832
So when you start getting worried about your positions…

94
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:44,832
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

95
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:51,832
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

96
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:56,832
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

97
00:27:56,832 --> 00:28:00,832
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

98
00:28:00,832 --> 00:28:02,832
they won’t get promotions or something,

99
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,832
there will be problem.

100
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:08,832
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

101
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,832
They have no freedom of any kind.

102
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:16,832
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

103
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:20,832
that even worse than people with money.

104
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,832
Because once they are lost they are lost.

105
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:27,832
They can never revive. No chance.

106
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,832
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

107
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:30,832
nobody is going to look at you.

108
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:34,832
I have known people who have been at a very high position

109
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:39,832
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

110
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:40,832
they just walk like straight,

111
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,832
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

112
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:48,832
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

113
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,832
They just walk like ordinary people.

114
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:54,832
Even seeing all these things happening,

115
00:28:54,832 --> 00:29:00,832
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

116
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:04,832
they do not keep to that truth,

117
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:07,832
they do not realise that truth,

118
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:13,832
they do not have that realisation within them.

119
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:18,832
They understand for a while and they go after that.

120
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:21,832
Then when the person dies,

121
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:27,832
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

122
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,832
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

123
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:33,832
On the contrary, the people,

124
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:37,832
the prime ministers and all those high ranking people, when they die,

125
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:41,832
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

126
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:45,832
all the dirty things they did

127
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:50,832
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

128
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,832
There’s no fragrance in their life,

129
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,832
no idealism. Nothing.

130
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:59,832
Because the responsibility

131
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,832
that they have to the public

132
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:06,832
and to themselves they have not understood it

133
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:09,832
and they made a mess of their private life.

134
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:15,832
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

135
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,832
The other day I was reading

136
00:30:18,832 --> 00:30:22,832
an interview with a very well known actor.

137
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:26,832
He’s a born-realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

138
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,832
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

139
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:31,832
what’s the harm in gambling,?

140
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,832
what’s the harm in smoking?

141
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,832
Because, after all, I’m going to die

142
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:42,832
and then who is going to bother?

143
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:44,832
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

144
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:46,832
In any case I’m going to die.

145
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:49,532
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

146
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:55,532
But what about death? You continue with it.

147
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:59,532
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

148
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:05,532
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

149
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,532
Children will spit at you. What about that?

150
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:13,532
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

151
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:16,532
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

152
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:18,532
But when you die

153
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:22,532
all this craziness will disappear

154
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:26,532
and people will come out with truth about you.

155
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:32,532
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

156
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:36,532
This cheap popularity,

157
00:31:36,532 --> 00:31:44,532
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

158
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:50,532
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

159
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:53,532
that will not be accepted.

160
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:56,532
Nobody will quote you as something great.

161
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:58,532
For some time it will continue,

162
00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:04,532
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

163
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:11,532
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

164
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:13,532
People go into action

165
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:22,532
for achieving the results of getting into power.

166
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:28,532
But it should act to discover the truth.

167
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:38,532
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

168
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:45,532
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

169
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:48,532
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

170
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:53,532
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

171
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:56,532
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

172
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,532
This one can learn from others,

173
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:03,532
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

174
00:33:03,532 --> 00:33:09,532
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

175
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:11,532
If you want to learn,

176
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:15,532
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

177
00:33:15,532 --> 00:33:20,532
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

178
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,532
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

179
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:25,532
it’s said that:

180
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:29,532
if by reading these four Vedas,

181
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:33,532
if you do not get the veeda,

182
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:38,532
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

183
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:47,532
there is no use reading these Vedas.

184
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:55,532
So the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

185
00:33:55,532 --> 00:34:00,532
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

186
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:05,532
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race

187
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:06,532
and we have to get out of it.

188
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:08,532
We have to step out.

189
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:10,532
When that happens,

190
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,532
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

191
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:18,532
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

192
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:25,532
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

193
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:30,532
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

194
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:35,532
through evolutionary process in human beings.

195
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,532
He starts evolving simultaneously.

196
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:43,532
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

197
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:51,532
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

198
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:55,532
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

199
00:34:55,532 --> 00:35:03,532
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

200
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:11,532
and the other human bondages of power,

201
00:35:11,532 --> 00:35:14,532
money, lust

202
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:19,532
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

203
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:27,532
He gives us a new idea of popularity

204
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:32,532
by establishing the Truth.

205
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:35,532
Because through Mahalakshmi power

206
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:41,532
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

207
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:52,532
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

208
00:35:55,532 --> 00:36:00,532
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

209
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:05,532
one starts thinking of others.

210
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:08,532
Not on material level,

211
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:10,532
that materially people are suffering,

212
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:13,532
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

213
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:15,532
We must give them some food, this, that.

214
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:21,532
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

215
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,532
Or they don’t think there should be

216
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:26,532
equal distribution of money and wealth.

217
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,532
No. This is superficial.

218
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:36,532
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

219
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:41,532
They feel they have no freedom.

220
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:46,532
Those people who have money are not happy

221
00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:51,532
because they have a demonic life.

222
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:55,532
Where they are free they behave like devils.

223
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:57,532
No sense of totality,

224
00:36:57,532 --> 00:37:00,532
no sense of collectivity.

225
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:04,532
When they become like that,

226
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:14,532
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

227
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:20,532
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

228
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,532
They fight for lands,

229
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,532
they fight for nations,

230
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:29,532
they fight for rights.

231
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:32,532
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

232
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:39,532
Start destroying people, human beings.

233
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:44,532
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

234
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,532
mostly in the West,

235
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:51,532
and also all the Arabic countries,

236
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:55,532
I would say – is of the right side.

237
00:37:56,532 --> 00:38:02,532
And in the East it is of the left side, the turmoils.

238
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:07,532
It’s very surprising that

239
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,532
it’s very contrasting also.

240
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:11,532
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

241
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:14,532
I can’t understand it sometimes

242
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:18,532
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

243
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:30,532
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

244
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:33,532
that they should have problem of the left side.

245
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:36,532
They do puja, they have shraddha,

246
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:38,532
they are like Catholics, we can say,

247
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,532
are never rich people,

248
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:44,532
seldom, except in Switzerland,

249
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:46,532
I think, here everybody’s rich

250
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:50,532
because they are so money-oriented.

251
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:58,532
So, or the people where they are right sided,

252
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:03,532
when they neglect their chastity,

253
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,532
not bothered about the right side,

254
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:13,532
they have the problems of the right side,

255
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:17,532
is very surprising.

256
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:23,532
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

257
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:27,532
they go too much into it.

258
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:35,532
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

259
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:41,532
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

260
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,532
without any activity.

261
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,532
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

262
00:39:45,532 --> 00:39:47,532
Just come down,

263
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:49,532
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

264
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,532
nicely blessed, go home.

265
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:52,532
Nothing to be done,

266
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:55,532
no activity.

267
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:59,532
So there is no balance.

268
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:04,532
So they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

269
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,532
No, if you are a right sided person,

270
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,532
then puja will help you,

271
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,532
but not if you are a left sided person.

272
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:19,532
Puja does help,

273
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,532
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

274
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,532
in both the sides,

275
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:26,532
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

276
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:42,532
So the puja part when they do …

277
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:48,532
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

278
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:54,532
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

279
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:55,532
you do not know that.

280
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:57,532
Saptashati. That’s where we have

281
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:59,532
that thing that the way people do,

282
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:01,532
they get possessed,

283
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:02,532
they can’t understand.

284
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:05,532
First of all they have a statue of someone

285
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,532
made by some horrible fellow.

286
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:10,532
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

287
00:41:10,532 --> 00:41:12,532
they are God-fearing,

288
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:14,532
everything is good,

289
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:18,532
we have got temples where there are also,

290
00:41:18,532 --> 00:41:21,532
we can say, swayambhus

291
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:25,532
from the Mother Earth,

292
00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:27,532
which are worshipped

293
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:28,532
and should be all right,

294
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:31,532
but no, they get possessed. Why?

295
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,532
Because most of them,

296
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:40,532
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

297
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,532
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

298
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:46,532
And when people go and do the pujas there

299
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:49,532
what happens to them?

300
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:52,532
That they get attacked,

301
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,532
they become more left sided.

302
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:02,532
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

303
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:03,532
which is neerakara,

304
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:05,532
which is formless,

305
00:42:08,532 --> 00:42:10,532
they go to the right side.

306
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:12,532
There’s formless God,

307
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,532
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

308
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,532
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

309
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:19,532
everybody’s God.

310
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:22,532
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

311
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:25,532
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

312
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,532
everybody’s God,

313
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:29,532
starts on that principle.

314
00:42:32,532 --> 00:42:35,532
So they go onto supraconscious side

315
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:38,532
and they become demonic.

316
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:43,532
Then they must fight,

317
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:44,532
because they are devils. Devils have to fight,

318
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:47,532
otherwise how will they exist?

319
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:52,532
They fight, they aggress,

320
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,532
they go to other countries,

321
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:57,532
aggress them, capture them,

322
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,532
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

323
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:02,532
In a subtler way they aggress,

324
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:05,532
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

325
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:09,532
There are so many ways of aggression

326
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:15,532
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

327
00:43:15,532 --> 00:43:17,532
For anything.

328
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:20,532
They’ll ask direct questions,

329
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:26,532
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

330
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:29,532
they become cruel.

331
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:35,532
That’s how the turmoil starts

332
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:38,532
when we start using the power of Saraswati

333
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,532
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

334
00:43:47,532 --> 00:43:51,532
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

335
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:53,532
we have to go into lot of activity.

336
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:55,532
You have to decorate the hall,

337
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,532
you have to get the flowers,

338
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:01,532
you have to organize everything beautifully.

339
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:05,532
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

340
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:08,532
Then you starts balancing yourself

341
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:11,532
with all these activities you do.

342
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:19,532
And then you sit down for puja.

343
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:22,532
That’s like in the daytime you work,

344
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:23,532
in the night you sleep.

345
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,532
To rest, to get the place you must be active.

346
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:33,532
Like they have to climb Himalayas

347
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:36,532
to achieve meditation.

348
00:44:37,532 --> 00:44:39,532
Because when you are tired,

349
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:43,532
you can be restful afterwards.

350
00:44:43,532 --> 00:44:45,532
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

351
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:47,532
say, from Switzerland only,

352
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:53,532
the very speedy person for meditation,

353
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:56,532
you’ll have to put the glue on him

354
00:44:57,532 --> 00:45:00,532
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

355
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:04,532
all the time. Will be all the time jumping.

356
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:16,532
So the activity has to come before the puja

357
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:20,532
and the balance has to be established.

358
00:45:20,532 --> 00:45:23,532
So the ladies have to find out the saris

359
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:25,532
and the blouses and this and that

360
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:27,532
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

361
00:45:27,532 --> 00:45:30,532
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

362
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,532
We have to travel.

363
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:37,532
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

364
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:40,532
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

365
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:47,532
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

366
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:50,532
how they are going to pay back their loans!

367
00:45:54,532 --> 00:46:00,532
All this futuristic planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

368
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:09,532
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

369
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:14,532
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

370
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:21,532
So the ascent starts evolving.

371
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:30,532
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

372
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:35,532
Navaratri that’s why is the most important Puja.

373
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:41,532
.In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja

374
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:48,532
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

375
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:53,532
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

376
00:46:54,532 --> 00:47:02,532
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

377
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:07,532
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

378
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:13,532
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

379
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:19,532
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

380
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:28,532
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

381
00:47:28,532 --> 00:47:29,532
So it’s like a thanksgiving.

382
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:35,532
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

383
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:39,532
So when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

384
00:47:39,532 --> 00:47:43,532
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

385
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:52,532
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

386
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:56,532
how She worked hard,

387
00:47:56,532 --> 00:47:59,532
how she fought the devils,

388
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:05,532
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

389
00:48:06,532 --> 00:48:12,532
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

390
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:18,532
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the one who brought you out.

391
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:22,532
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

392
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:29,532
She’s the one who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

393
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:33,532
In Her love for you She fought.

394
00:48:33,532 --> 00:48:35,532
She brought you to this level.

395
00:48:35,532 --> 00:48:40,532
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

396
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:44,532
Even during the time of all the gurus

397
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:54,532
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

398
00:48:54,532 --> 00:49:01,532
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

399
00:49:01,532 --> 00:49:04,532
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

400
00:49:04,532 --> 00:49:17,532
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

401
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:24,532
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

402
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:36,532
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

403
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:39,532
So today is the day of thanksgiving.

404
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:43,864
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

405
00:49:44,532 --> 00:49:46,532
the One who has counselled you,

406
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:50,532
the One who has told you about the Truth,

407
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:57,532
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

408
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:03,532
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

409
00:50:05,532 --> 00:50:09,532
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

410
00:50:09,532 --> 00:50:18,532
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

411
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:24,532
every sort of problems that existed

412
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:31,532
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

413
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:35,532
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

414
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:43,532
So we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

415
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:50,532
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

416
00:50:53,532 --> 00:50:59,532
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

417
00:50:59,532 --> 00:51:05,532
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

418
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:08,532
But the Mother forgives you,

419
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:13,532
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

420
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:19,532
She has tremendous patience and tremendous love and She does it single-handed.

421
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:23,532
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

422
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:31,532
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

423
00:51:31,532 --> 00:51:41,532
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

424
00:51:43,532 --> 00:51:48,532
So it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

425
00:51:48,532 --> 00:52:01,532
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

426
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:07,532
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

427
00:52:09,532 --> 00:52:12,532
Then She took the form of Radha.

428
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:21,532
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

429
00:52:23,532 --> 00:52:30,532
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

430
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:36,532
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

431
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:40,532
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

432
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:46,532
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

433
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:48,532
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

434
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,532
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

435
00:52:53,532 --> 00:52:59,532
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

436
00:52:59,532 --> 00:53:02,532
and how one feels about it.

437
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:07,532
After doing that,

438
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:13,532
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

439
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:16,832
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

440
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:20,532
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

441
00:53:20,532 --> 00:53:28,532
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

442
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:34,532
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

443
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:40,532
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

444
00:53:40,532 --> 00:53:42,532
and how troublesome they can be!

445
00:53:42,532 --> 00:53:47,532
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

446
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:53,532
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

447
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:01,532
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

448
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:07,532
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

449
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:14,532
So the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

450
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:17,532
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

451
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:23,532
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

452
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:28,532
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

453
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:34,532
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started

454
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:38,532
that it is the power of love.

455
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:47,532
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

456
00:54:47,532 --> 00:54:53,532
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

457
00:54:55,532 --> 00:55:02,532
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

458
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:10,532
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

459
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:13,532
Maybe you are lonely so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

460
00:55:13,532 --> 00:55:19,532
Maybe you do it because you think that, that’s how you spread your powers.

461
00:55:19,532 --> 00:55:24,532
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

462
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:28,532
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

463
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:33,532
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

464
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:37,532
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

465
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:48,532
As they have mock governments we have a mock leadership.

466
00:55:50,532 --> 00:55:54,532
So then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

467
00:55:54,532 --> 00:55:57,532
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler.

468
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:06,532
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

469
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:09,532
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

470
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,532
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

471
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:18,532
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

472
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:20,532
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

473
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:27,532
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

474
00:56:30,532 --> 00:56:33,532
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

475
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:43,532
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

476
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:49,532
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

477
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:54,532
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

478
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:58,532
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

479
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:02,432
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much myself

480
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:05,532
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

481
00:57:06,832 --> 00:57:09,832
But you have to donate.

482
00:57:12,832 --> 00:57:18,832
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

483
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:25,832
You have bank balances but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

484
00:57:26,832 --> 00:57:30,832
The bank balance should be with God.

485
00:57:30,832 --> 00:57:35,832
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

486
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,832
Is there any bank which does that?

487
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:45,832
At least not the Swiss Bank!

488
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,832
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

489
00:57:54,832 --> 00:58:03,832
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

490
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:11,832
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

491
00:58:11,832 --> 00:58:15,832
that people think that now their children are realised-souls.

492
00:58:16,832 --> 00:58:20,832
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

493
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:25,832
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

494
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:30,832
But to them their child is so important,

495
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:32,832
they get so adhered to the child.

496
00:58:32,832 --> 00:58:37,832
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

497
00:58:37,832 --> 00:58:41,832
that they look like glued people all the time.

498
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:48,832
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

499
00:58:49,832 --> 00:58:52,832
Give them full freedom to grow.

500
00:58:52,832 --> 00:59:01,832
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

501
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:06,832
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

502
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:11,832
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about you now, how they should be.

503
00:59:11,832 --> 00:59:16,832
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

504
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,832
Not to glue them to you.

505
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:26,832
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

506
00:59:26,832 --> 00:59:28,832
if you glue them to yourself.

507
00:59:30,832 --> 00:59:35,832
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

508
00:59:36,832 --> 00:59:41,832
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

509
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:46,832
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

510
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:50,832
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

511
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:55,832
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

512
00:59:55,832 --> 00:59:59,832
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

513
00:59:59,832 --> 01:00:04,832
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

514
01:00:05,832 --> 01:00:11,832
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

515
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:20,832
And some fathers also I have seen glue down to their children

516
01:00:21,832 --> 01:00:28,832
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

517
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:33,832
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

518
01:00:33,832 --> 01:00:36,832
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

519
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:40,832
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own,”

520
01:00:40,832 --> 01:00:43,832
Like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

521
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:48,832
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

522
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:51,832
And she was a daughter of a lord!

523
01:00:51,832 --> 01:00:56,832
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

524
01:00:56,832 --> 01:01:00,832
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

525
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:03,832
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

526
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:06,832
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

527
01:01:06,832 --> 01:01:09,832
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

528
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:17,832
So the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

529
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:22,832
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

530
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:28,832
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

531
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:34,832
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised-soul in Sahaja Yoga.

532
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:37,832
How much do you do for other’s children?

533
01:01:37,832 --> 01:01:40,832
Or only you look after your own child?

534
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,832
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

535
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:50,832
buy two more things for another child.

536
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:55,832
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

537
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:03,832
Let your child share his things with others.

538
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:08,832
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

539
01:02:08,832 --> 01:02:10,832
Teach him how to share.

540
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:16,832
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

541
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:21,832
they’ll become again the same miserly old style people:

542
01:02:23,832 --> 01:02:29,832
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

543
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:31,832
So be careful .

544
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:42,832
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

545
01:02:42,832 --> 01:02:45,832
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

546
01:02:45,832 --> 01:02:47,832
let them look after.

547
01:02:47,832 --> 01:02:54,832
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

548
01:02:54,832 --> 01:02:58,832
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

549
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:01,832
You close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

550
01:03:02,832 --> 01:03:06,832
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

551
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:10,832
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

552
01:03:11,832 --> 01:03:15,832
We are in the government of God.

553
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:19,832
This realisation has to come.

554
01:03:19,832 --> 01:03:24,832
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

555
01:03:25,832 --> 01:03:30,832
Understand your responsibility

556
01:03:30,832 --> 01:03:36,832
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and in the middle

557
01:03:38,832 --> 01:03:42,832
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

558
01:03:42,832 --> 01:03:48,832
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

559
01:03:50,832 --> 01:03:54,832
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

560
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:58,832
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

561
01:03:58,832 --> 01:04:00,832
You’ll have problems.

562
01:04:00,832 --> 01:04:03,832
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

563
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:13,832
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

564
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:23,832
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

565
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:29,832
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

566
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:40,832
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

567
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:43,832
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

568
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:47,832
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

569
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:55,832
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

570
01:04:55,832 --> 01:04:59,832
But you don’t know [that] these are tentacles which keep you down,

571
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:05,832
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

572
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:11,832
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

573
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:14,832
are looked after by God Almighty.

574
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:20,832
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

575
01:05:20,832 --> 01:05:31,832
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

576
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:42,832
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

577
01:05:42,832 --> 01:05:51,832
So just if you believe and assume that power today

578
01:05:51,832 --> 01:05:55,832
that you are in the domain of God,

579
01:05:56,832 --> 01:06:00,832
which is active benevolence,

580
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:05,832
the nature of it is active benevolence

581
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,832
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

582
01:06:13,832 --> 01:06:17,832
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

583
01:06:17,832 --> 01:06:20,832
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

584
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:26,832
If you have money it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

585
01:06:30,832 --> 01:06:35,832
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

586
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:42,832
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

587
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:49,832
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

588
01:06:51,832 --> 01:06:53,832
Really, in the real sense of the word?

589
01:06:54,832 --> 01:06:58,832
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

590
01:06:58,832 --> 01:07:00,832
is he benevolent?

591
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:07,832
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

592
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:17,832
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

593
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:23,832
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

594
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:27,832
you have to know that everything works through His power:

595
01:07:27,832 --> 01:07:36,832
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

596
01:07:36,832 --> 01:07:41,832
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

597
01:07:41,832 --> 01:07:44,832
You go a little ahead with it

598
01:07:47,832 --> 01:07:53,832
and it showers flowers upon you.

599
01:07:55,832 --> 01:08:02,832
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

600
01:08:02,832 --> 01:08:06,832
Mostly I’ve seen left-sided persons always want to do my pujas.

601
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:11,832
And the right-sided person are organising.Do the other way round.

602
01:08:11,832 --> 01:08:19,832
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

603
01:08:19,832 --> 01:08:24,832
Like you entering into a door, say for example,

604
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:27,832
and you have too much load on your back,

605
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:29,832
meaning you are a left-sided person.

606
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:36,832
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

607
01:08:36,832 --> 01:08:43,832
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

608
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:46,832
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

609
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:50,832
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

610
01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:55,832
I see in aeroplane when people are walking they are holding it in one hand

611
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:59,832
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

612
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:01,832
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

613
01:09:02,832 --> 01:09:08,832
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

614
01:09:08,832 --> 01:09:13,832
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

615
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:20,832
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

616
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:28,832
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

617
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:37,832
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

618
01:09:38,832 --> 01:09:46,832
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

619
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:53,832
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

620
01:09:53,832 --> 01:09:58,832
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

621
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:04,832
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

622
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:09,832
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money and they are not bothered!

623
01:10:24,832 --> 01:10:27,832
So, for such people what should we do?

624
01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:32,832
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

625
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:42,832
One has to work out something.

626
01:10:45,832 --> 01:10:47,832
They just don’t move

627
01:10:47,832 --> 01:10:53,832
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot,

628
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:57,832
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

629
01:10:57,832 --> 01:11:00,832
That’s all. Then what do you say?

630
01:11:00,832 --> 01:11:06,832
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

631
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:20,832
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

632
01:11:29,832 --> 01:11:32,832
So one has to do.

633
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,832
Everyone has to do something.

634
01:11:36,832 --> 01:11:38,832
Somebody is working it out,

635
01:11:38,832 --> 01:11:42,632
somebody is doing some work,

636
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,632
and another is not helping.

637
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:51,632
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

638
01:11:52,632 --> 01:11:57,632
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

639
01:11:57,632 --> 01:12:03,632
So we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

640
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:07,632
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

641
01:12:08,632 --> 01:12:10,632
I cannot do it single-handed.

642
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:15,632
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

643
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:20,632
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

644
01:12:20,632 --> 01:12:22,632
It’s not possible.

645
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:26,632
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

646
01:12:26,632 --> 01:12:30,632
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

647
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:33,632
not like small children. So you have to mature.

648
01:12:34,632 --> 01:12:39,632
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

649
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:43,632
In the beginning in the school they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

650
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:47,632
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

651
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:51,632
solve the problem yourself.

652
01:12:51,632 --> 01:12:59,632
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

653
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:03,632
but the maturity has to take place,

654
01:13:03,632 --> 01:13:05,632
otherwise useless.

655
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:13,632
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

656
01:13:14,632 --> 01:13:17,632
And that all of you have to do together,

657
01:13:17,632 --> 01:13:20,632
helping each other, understanding each other.

658
01:13:20,632 --> 01:13:24,632
And everyone has to work it out.

659
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:27,632
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

660
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:36,632
The whole thing has become collective.

661
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:41,632
The Devi has become collective.

662
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:46,632
It’s a venture.

663
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:53,632
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

664
01:13:53,632 --> 01:14:01,632
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

665
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:06,632
But it’s alright.

666
01:14:09,632 --> 01:14:13,632
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

667
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:19,632
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm

668
01:14:19,632 --> 01:14:24,632
that we have to do it, because Mother has gave us the power.

669
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:27,632
We can do it, nothing should keep us down.

670
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:30,632
And we are going to help each other.

671
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:36,632
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

672
01:14:36,632 --> 01:14:41,632
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

673
01:14:45,632 --> 01:14:48,632
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

674
01:14:48,632 --> 01:14:52,632
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

675
01:14:54,632 --> 01:14:56,632
So you get out with your bhoot!

676
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:59,632
That’s what it is.

677
01:15:01,632 --> 01:15:11,632
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

678
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:15,632
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

679
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:21,632
you have not understood the meaning of yourself and you have no respect for your life.

680
01:15:21,632 --> 01:15:22,632
That’s what it is.

681
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:26,632
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

682
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:31,632
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

683
01:15:32,632 --> 01:15:37,632
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

684
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:42,632
The time has come.

685
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:53,632
Which is going to make you real yogis.

686
01:15:56,632 --> 01:15:58,632
Complete dedication.

687
01:15:58,632 --> 01:16:04,632
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

688
01:16:04,632 --> 01:16:06,632
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

689
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:09,632
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

690
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:13,632
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

691
01:16:17,632 --> 01:16:20,632
They are not afraid of anything,

692
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:23,632
they are dare devils.

693
01:16:23,632 --> 01:16:25,632
Why can’t we become like that?

694
01:16:26,632 --> 01:16:29,632
What’s wrong with us?

695
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:37,632
So every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

696
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:42,632
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

697
01:16:42,632 --> 01:16:46,632
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

698
01:16:46,632 --> 01:16:50,632
No! We are all going to move out also

699
01:16:50,632 --> 01:16:53,632
and take up a place somewhere else.

700
01:16:53,632 --> 01:16:55,632
For the time being ashram is alright.

701
01:16:55,632 --> 01:16:58,632
But then give more room to others who are coming.

702
01:16:58,632 --> 01:17:02,632
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

703
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:08,632
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

704
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:12,632
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

705
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:23,632
Actually you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

706
01:17:23,632 --> 01:17:29,632
Of course now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to bring.

707
01:17:30,632 --> 01:17:33,632
Better live on a shoestring.

708
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:39,632
So the tapasya starts.

709
01:17:39,632 --> 01:17:42,632
Go into a penance yourself.

710
01:17:42,632 --> 01:17:47,632
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

711
01:17:47,632 --> 01:17:52,632
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

712
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:55,632
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise it’s nonsense.

713
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:59,632
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

714
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:03,632
with enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

715
01:18:04,632 --> 01:18:07,632
look at these people,

716
01:18:09,632 --> 01:18:15,632
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

717
01:18:16,632 --> 01:18:19,632
You have examples of people around you.

718
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:23,632
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

719
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:29,632
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

720
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:35,632
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

721
01:18:41,632 --> 01:18:47,632
So tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

722
01:18:55,632 --> 01:19:00,632
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

723
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:04,632
or to be in my attention

724
01:19:05,632 --> 01:19:12,632
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

725
01:19:17,632 --> 01:19:23,632
I am just a mirror and you see within myself, yourself, in the true way.

726
01:19:23,632 --> 01:19:29,632
And also this mirror is full of maya.

727
01:19:29,632 --> 01:19:39,632
So a devil may look into this mirror and may look like a saint to him.

728
01:19:39,632 --> 01:19:43,632
If he has ego he might look like a saint to himself.

729
01:19:45,632 --> 01:19:56,632
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

730
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:10,632
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

731
01:20:10,632 --> 01:20:16,632
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

732
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:28,632
So to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

733
01:20:28,632 --> 01:20:32,632
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

734
01:20:32,632 --> 01:20:37,632
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

735
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,632
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

736
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:50,632
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

737
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:53,632
What are they talking about is economics!

738
01:20:57,632 --> 01:21:00,632
They do not know anything about His politics.

739
01:21:02,632 --> 01:21:07,632
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

740
01:21:07,632 --> 01:21:10,632
which rules the whole Universe

741
01:21:11,632 --> 01:21:16,632
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

742
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:23,632
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

743
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:28,632
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

744
01:21:28,632 --> 01:21:33,632
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

745
01:21:33,632 --> 01:21:36,632
All this you know. How I came here.

746
01:21:36,632 --> 01:21:41,632
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

747
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,632
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

748
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,632
And it has another force as I told you

749
01:21:46,632 --> 01:21:50,632
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

750
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:58,632
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

751
01:21:58,632 --> 01:22:02,632
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

752
01:22:02,632 --> 01:22:07,632
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

753
01:22:07,632 --> 01:22:10,632
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

754
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:20,632
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

755
01:22:22,632 --> 01:22:28,632
And so much power can be born.

756
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:33,632
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

757
01:22:33,632 --> 01:22:36,632
has so much power in it.

758
01:22:37,632 --> 01:22:39,632
You know about hydrostatics.

759
01:22:42,632 --> 01:22:46,632
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

760
01:22:46,632 --> 01:22:51,632
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

761
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:54,632
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

762
01:22:54,632 --> 01:22:56,632
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

763
01:22:57,632 --> 01:23:02,632
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

764
01:23:02,632 --> 01:23:06,632
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

765
01:23:06,632 --> 01:23:14,632
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

766
01:23:18,632 --> 01:23:22,632
This Navaratri should give you that power,

767
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:28,632
those nine powers of nine chakras.

768
01:23:28,632 --> 01:23:33,632
Seven chakras you already know.

769
01:23:33,632 --> 01:23:38,632
Above that you become the master yourself,

770
01:23:39,632 --> 01:23:44,632
and then you become the Power yourself.

771
01:23:52,632 --> 01:23:54,632
May God bless you!
