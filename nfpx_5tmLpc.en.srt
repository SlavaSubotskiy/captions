1
00:00:02,508 --> 00:00:20,484
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna Puja.
I went to America and they wanted Me to have

2
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:29,014
a Mahakali Puja. But I said, “No, let Me
talk about Krishna only.” Because we have

3
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:41,978
to first realize what is the strength of this
Puja, how are we going to establish Shri Krishna

4
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,716
within ourselves.

5
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:50,985
He Himself has said that “Whenever there
is a downfall of dharma.” Dharma doesn’t

6
00:00:51,010 --> 00:01:03,847
mean what we understand as Hinduism, Christianity
or Islamic nonsense - it is not. Dharma means

7
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:16,640
our primordial taboos that are built-in, in
the human beings. About these, I think aboriginals

8
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:25,601
knew better than we. But then what we did,
we dominated them and also they had to change

9
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:37,631
their style of life. The primordial taboos
are only understood if people are trying to

10
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:45,400
understand oneself or else whatever has come
to them through tradition.

11
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:56,050
Now, sahaj dharma is little bit different
in the sense that it’s much higher than

12
00:01:56,075 --> 00:02:06,240
the sahaj ideas that we talk of, but it’s
much higher than even what Shri Krishna said

13
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:15,390
or Shri Rama said. First, Shri Rama thought,
best is to give them disciplines. People should

14
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:25,790
be serious about life, have full idea about
their own being, they should respect themselves.

15
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:35,971
All these things were written down long time
back. Also, people, basically when they were

16
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:44,080
good people, they understood that whatever
is bad for us, we should not do. These are

17
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,766
primordial taboos.

18
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:56,076
Now, these primordial taboos are built in
within us. Now, supposing I say, “Don’t

19
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:04,546
drink.” You will go and drink. If I say,
“Don’t tell lies,” you will tell lies.

20
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:11,002
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo, because they think

21
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:18,796
now they have freedom, freedom to do what
they like. You are free people. Actually they

22
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:30,507
are not. They are under the spell of all the
kinds of allurement, you can call it, or temptations

23
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:44,055
which are against human life. And it’s very
natural to be a person of dharma. Small children

24
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
mostly have it.

25
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,160
For example, I’ve seen children, they feel
very shy to take out their clothes - even

26
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,880
small, small boys, I’ve seen. They won’t
take out their clothes in the presence of

27
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:08,141
others; they feel shy. So, all these are described
like, Ya Devi, Sarva Butheshu, Lajja Rupena

28
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:19,295
Samsthita. So, you should be shy; you should
be humble and respect your body, it’s very

29
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,110
important in these modern times. Exposure
of body is regarded as a great achievement

30
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,110
of women. They are trying to become aboriginals,
you see. That time they never had these ideas

31
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,600
and they were not so confused, you see. So,
even if their women were scantily dressed,

32
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:47,052
it didn’t mean that it was some sort of
a sex or some sort of an attraction for men,

33
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:56,215
or men behaving in funny manners to show that
they have a special attraction for women.

34
00:04:56,239 --> 00:05:06,854
I mean, why should you? It is absolutely absurd
that men should be attracted to women and

35
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:12,959
women should be attracted to men - and on
the road, on the street, you go, you see,

36
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:21,914
just that going on! This adharma is the worst
I think, for it’s a curse. Because after

37
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,259
coming to Sahaja Yoga also people start doing
this nonsense, you know. They should all go

38
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:32,189
to lunatic asylum, I think, they are no good
for Sahaja Yoga. But dharma gets established

39
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,339
as soon as you have the light of the spirit.

40
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:50,044
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put down
A, B, C, D, E, F. At the time of Moses, also

41
00:05:50,069 --> 00:06:00,504
He had to put down Ten Commandments. But Krishna
thought the other way round - to establish

42
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:13,414
a dharma of pure love - pure love. So, because
He wanted that Shri Rama’s taboos were forced

43
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:22,224
on people, just like Islamic, just like Christians
- never works. So, He thought better to ask

44
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:32,374
them in their freedom, they must develop pure
love. Radha, who was with Him as His power,

45
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:39,399
is called as Alladhadayini. She’s the one
who gives joy - pure joy!

46
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:52,806
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble. Now, drinking is against

47
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:58,907
you, you know that. Today they are talking
about tobacco, tomorrow they’ll talk of

48
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:04,306
drinking when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

49
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:14,196
Then they will taboo it. But it’s a natural
taboo for your body. If you do something all

50
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:21,521
the time which is not good for you, for your
good life, you are becoming adharma.

51
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:38,549
This is to be understood very clearly that
the sahaja dharma is that you are just free

52
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:46,641
- complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense. You’re above it. You’re above.

53
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:56,848
This sahaj dharma is above the dharma established
by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama, because you

54
00:07:56,873 --> 00:08:05,928
have reached that stage. Is in complete freedom
you have to be dharmic. Whatever is not good

55
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:14,308
for you, you should not do. I don’t have
to tell you that you don’t do this or you

56
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:21,333
don’t do that. Whatever I say may not be
acceptable, but immediately your vibrations

57
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:22,783
will tell you.

58
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:30,123
This is sahaj dharma. In the sahaj dharma
you get rid of all kinds of, as they say:

59
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:53,984
kaama, krodha, mada, matsa, lobha, moha. Means:
lust, anger, attractions, then greed. Greed

60
00:08:54,009 --> 00:09:05,580
- that’s very important, greed. Greed. And
attractions. Now, if you understand how people

61
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:17,181
are greedy, greedy for what? This America
is dying of consumerism, you see. Now, see

62
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:24,851
the trick of the trade. In America, you can
borrow any amount of money from the bank,

63
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:33,811
no problem. Now, even if you don’t borrow,
they’ll send you a letter, “Why don’t

64
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:39,736
you take twenty thousand checks we are sending
you, why not have it? Ah, very rich you’ll

65
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:48,771
become, you see – it’s very nice to take
the loan.” I was told some people used to

66
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:55,346
come to Ganapatipule after taking loans. I
said, “Stop that nonsense!” So they take

67
00:09:55,346 --> 00:10:03,411
the loan and then they come to Ganapatipule.
All the time their mind is: ‘How will I

68
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:10,276
pay this loan, how will I manage?’ All the
time the attention is distracted, even when

69
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:16,166
you want to do something good to yourself
of coming to Ganapatipule.

70
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:28,021
So, such a mind is not free. The free mind
is that which has attention completely enlightened

71
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:40,201
by the spirit. But problem is we are still
rising out of this human bondage to a higher

72
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:52,251
life of realization. And when we are going
to that level, we have to realize that we

73
00:10:52,276 --> 00:11:03,451
have to give up all these shackles, all these
horrible things within us. Like a bird, when

74
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:11,521
it is born out of the egg, shakes out all
the parts of the egg. Your brothers, your

75
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:21,521
sisters, your father, your mother, your husband.
Everybody - they try to put you down. Now,

76
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:26,246
if they are drinking, they’ll say, “Come
along, you better have something to drink,

77
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:33,246
you are not social, you are useless, you are
not up to date. What is this nonsense?”

78
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:43,161
That’s how a fashion starts and this collective
action of fashion didn’t come from Shri

79
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:46,946
Krishna and not in Sahaj.

80
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:52,206
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses. If you want, you can wear

81
00:11:52,206 --> 00:12:04,641
a good dress, if you don’t want you need
not. You are free. You are free from money

82
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:10,416
bondage. This is very important. Money bondage
is another thing. I know some Sahaja Yogis

83
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:17,056
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make money
out of Sahaja Yoga. You came to Sahaja Yoga

84
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:22,735
for what? To get out of that money bondage.
In the sahaj dharma, to you money is nothing

85
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:28,185
but the dust of your feet. Nothing so important.

86
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:38,641
Then, we have such a collective sense of accepting
nonsense. That has to be dropped out, specially

87
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:56,891
in America, I was surprised. Also in England.
A fellow came as a hippie. His hair were looking

88
00:12:57,036 --> 00:13:05,901
like some monkey. Monkey is better I must
say. I don’t know like what, all put together

89
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:12,605
like a, you can say - there is nothing to
compare, I tell you.

90
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,935
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

91
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:22,085
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

92
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:27,016
I said, “But your brain is modern, what’s
the use of growing your hair like that? You

93
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:33,445
think you can become primitive? You cannot!”

94
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:43,361
Then afterwards I learned that he died. Another
one like that came and he didn’t die, but

95
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:50,273
went to lunatic asylum. Like that I met many,
but why do you do it? Because that’s the

96
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:52,526
fashion.

97
00:13:52,526 --> 00:14:01,481
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers. Now there is a

98
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:08,435
joke about the ouveau riche people, in Russia especially.

99
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:16,118
Russians are not like that, normally. They
don’t accept something because it’s a

100
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:25,521
fashion.
So, one fellow said that “My God you lost

101
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:32,095
your hand in that accident!”
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very expensive

102
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,556
watch from Switzerland.”
“Really? What?”

103
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:42,381
“It was a Rolex.”
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone. The

104
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:48,806
Rolex is gone - Rolex is the fashion.

105
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:52,876
So these are ouveau riche people who have money.

106
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:56,306
(Dog is on the stage)

107
00:14:56,306 --> 00:15:03,306
Come along. Come along. Sit down. Sit down.
Now, go down.

108
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:16,209
They (the dogs) don’t form any fashions,
I have not seen dogs taken to any fashions.

109
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:23,970
Monkeys taking, I mean, supposing, you see
the Italian designers make something special

110
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:34,674
for them, they won’t think much of it. Maybe
their masters might buy, but not these animals.

111
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:40,097
Now, we don’t have to become animals of
course, but we don’t also have to become

112
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,474
slaves of fashions.

113
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,213
So there are some shops which are very expensive.
Why? Because they are designers. So you move

114
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:55,491
about telling everybody, “See, I am wearing
this thing from a designer shop, this is from

115
00:15:55,491 --> 00:16:02,491
designer shop.” That means, what about you?
You have no sense of designs; you have no

116
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:10,645
sense of understanding what you need and what
you don’t need. And nowadays most of them

117
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,080
are in jail also, sorry to say, but they have
money and they have made money by befooling

118
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,911
you.

119
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:25,986
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things which

120
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:31,170
were coming from Italy - designs, Italian
designs, written that Italian design so they

121
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:41,836
were buying it, Italian design. I was surprised
that such artistic things they create that

122
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:51,805
are available everywhere, such beautiful things.
But what they believe in is some sort of a

123
00:16:51,830 --> 00:17:01,116
group madness, everybody wearing the same
kind of design is from this or that. This

124
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:06,060
is not sahaj dharma. You are not slaves of
anything. You are free people. You have not

125
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:13,535
to accept any design or anything. Ah, it is
there, is there! Let the stupid follow that.

126
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,450
We are Sahaja Yogis.

127
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:22,190
Now, this also prevails among people who are
supposed to be sadhus, they all dress up the

128
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:30,295
same way. How can you make out who is who?
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress

129
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,651
up the same way, look the same way, cut your
hair the same way. No. You have to be individuals,

130
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:45,246
because you are free, but that doesn’t mean
- freedom is always supported by wisdom - that

131
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:53,237
doesn’t mean that you do what you like.
All kinds of funny things happen when a person

132
00:17:53,251 --> 00:18:01,606
doesn’t know what is the light of the spirit.
In the light of the spirit, you don’t get

133
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:08,978
involved into this kind of collective madness
that is going on. We are so collective in

134
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:14,780
mad things. I wish they could be collective
more in wise things.

135
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:21,780
Wisdom is very important, and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji - alladhadayini shakti

136
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:31,846
- has to come within us. Means, when we meet
another person in the collectivity, another

137
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:43,305
person should feel happy with you. So He taught
the dharma of love. Love is not there if you

138
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:52,155
discard because he is black or because he
is brown, because he is white. It’s very

139
00:18:52,180 --> 00:19:00,435
superficial - what is black, white and yellow?
I don’t understand. Here they go to the

140
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:08,280
sea shores to make themselves black and there
they say, “we don’t want to have any blacks,”

141
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:19,716
specially for Americans. I think this kind
of separation I found there, among the blacks

142
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,384
and the whites, I really wept.

143
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:29,224
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said, “Mother
will you go to Harlem?”

144
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:34,684
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
Me black, I’m black. If you call Me white,

145
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:37,694
I’m white. If you call Me yellow, I’m
yellow, so I’m going.”

146
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:41,935
And there I had a lecture, you know, so many
people were there, really I cannot forget.

147
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:51,759
It is one of the most famous place that there
is built in that hall and the same hall is

148
00:19:51,784 --> 00:20:01,389
built in Australia where I had addressed many
people. I thought, just look at this! They

149
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:07,335
said, “Mother, the Australians copied from
us.” Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,

150
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:14,335
I tell you. I could see their heart, I could
feel it and the fellow was trying to compare,

151
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:19,134
after My lecture he just came, he hugged Me,
kissed Me. I mean, he would have even minced

152
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:28,183
Me, little boy about twenty-two years of age
- such love he felt. And he said, “Mother,

153
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,899
next time You come, You are going to come
to Harlem.” But I am told that hall is closed.

154
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:44,199
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy, not only against democracy

155
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:55,790
but against what Abraham Lincoln wanted. They
had such a great man there and there is a

156
00:20:55,815 --> 00:21:03,959
little street I saw in his name. Of course
in Washington they say they have some nice,

157
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:17,257
beautiful statues. But otherwise his principles
are finished; his ideals are finished because

158
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:26,701
somehow or other, some people came and wrote
against - England especially - against the

159
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:36,274
black people. What business they have to write
against something that is created by God?

160
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:43,484
If there are the same colors everywhere, they
all will look like military people. They have

161
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:49,730
to have different colors; they have to have
different hues. See, look at the trees; look

162
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:59,524
at the flowers. Look at the different hues
the sky has, just to make us happy – alladha.

163
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:08,364
What gives you happiness is variety. Variety
is a sign of beauty. If there is no variety,

164
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:15,965
it’s so boring I tell you, so very boring.
But they are very proud of it and they think

165
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,990
no end of themselves. They think they are
very great people; they have a sense of superiority,

166
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:29,654
because they have a certain type of nose or
maybe certain type of lips or maybe certain

167
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,240
types of hair. Such stupid things they are
and you join hands with them? How can you

168
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,090
join hands with them? You want your freedom?
Then be a free person. In the freedom you

169
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,929
have to have variety, very important.

170
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:54,929
I would say that now the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America should have a new

171
00:22:54,999 --> 00:23:03,839
style of drive; go to the black people. I
was very happy to see the South American seminar

172
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:11,695
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people. They went and met them. I have met

173
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,720
them also and I was so surprised that they
immediately said, “Mother, You are spiritual,

174
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,535
we know, but can You solve our problem?”

175
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,400
I said, “What’s your problem?”

176
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:30,049
“Very simple, we have a land – all right,
then - very little land, five, six acres of

177
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:38,036
land that belongs to us where the sage grows.”
Sage is a kind of a, according to them, is

178
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:45,536
a holy plant. All right. “Now, we always
meet, all of us, there for different festivals

179
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:51,212
because we regard that land as a holy land.”
They know so many things, you know. This is

180
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:58,192
a holy land; there were vibrations for that.
So they always used to meet, so natural.

181
00:23:58,192 --> 00:24:02,192
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?

182
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:07,551
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

183
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,822
I said, “To an Indian?”

184
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:14,472
“Yes, so can you request this Indian to
return it to us, we’ll pay him the money.”

185
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:19,617
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

186
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:27,148
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi! He won’t leave you
even one single pai, is he going to give you

187
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:33,021
this? I’m sorry, I may be divine or I may
be anything, I can’t help you.”

188
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:38,671
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it. They should have raised voice.

189
00:24:38,671 --> 00:24:43,431
They should have told the government, “Please
return their land. Why do you want to have

190
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:51,297
it? Why want to grab it?” As it is all the
Americans are immigrants. They don’t belong

191
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:58,964
to that place, that they were not owners of
that place, that ground - they are immigrants.

192
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:03,531
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that and then to think they are

193
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:08,511
superior. It’s very nice, somebody enters
your house and thinks he is very superior

194
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:12,531
and drives out all the people of the family.

195
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:18,801
That is what has happened in America and just
opposite is sahaj dharma. With sahaj dharma,

196
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:29,646
you take people into your heart, you love
them. Your love flows all the time; your compassion

197
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:37,009
flows all the time. To Me it’s a problem,
this body is more compassionate than Myself.

198
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:41,592
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything. It wants to solve

199
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:49,570
the problem of others, but I don’t think
you can have that kind of a body, you shouldn’t

200
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:53,741
have. But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

201
00:25:53,741 --> 00:26:00,741
You see on the street somebody who is a dark
fellow. I like about the black Americans that

202
00:26:00,781 --> 00:26:12,552
once I got down in one airport, so one gentleman,
black gentleman, “Hello darling, how are

203
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:15,501
You? How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

204
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:18,911
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

205
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:30,102
Then once I was traveling in - what was the
airport? Ursula was with Me. So he looked

206
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:39,092
at Me, one fellow, very tall, hefty, fat,
you know. He said, “Ah! Are You back again?”

207
00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:43,064
I said, “I’m back. You know Me?”

208
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:50,306
“Of course, of course, I know you.” He
had never met Me, I had never known him. But

209
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:58,198
I felt happy, I felt very happy. That’s
the best way to meet people.

210
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:04,264
Supposing you are walking on the street, you
see some black gentleman going. It’s a terrible

211
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:09,073
life there, I tell you; it’s a terrible
life for them. I’ve known, I’ve read books

212
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:15,353
on them, I’ve cried and wept and I felt
very sorry. So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should

213
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:21,413
just jump at them and you should say, “Hello,
how are you?” Shake hands with them. They

214
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:29,489
won’t cut your throat, I can tell you this.
In criminality, I don’t know who is more

215
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:35,203
criminal in America, whether they are the
blacks or the whites, competing. But, if you

216
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:41,353
are kind and if you are loving, you can remove
that part of criminality which is within them

217
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:45,543
because hatred can be only washed away by
pure love.

218
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:52,543
But people think they are very cunning, very
superior - in cunningness, of course. Otherwise,

219
00:27:52,568 --> 00:28:01,713
what is their superiority? Only this complexion,
this white complexion is the worst of all.

220
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:09,673
I was very fair, very fair, till I got married,
or for some time, and then I started becoming

221
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:16,043
darker and darker. Because white complexion
gets all kinds of, see, the light you put

222
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:22,693
on Me, I absorb, I get a black spot. So it’s
not a very great thing to be white, I don’t

223
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:30,219
think so. It looks very funny and pale and
joyless. But no use going to the sea, making

224
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:41,048
your body, I think brown - brown, not so black,
brown and then suffering from cancer of the

225
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:46,653
skin. This kind of stupidity is also very
much fashionable.

226
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:56,969
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get impressed
by these we should be on the watch. I saw

227
00:28:56,994 --> 00:29:00,689
My granddaughter was wearing a sleeveless
dress.

228
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:03,934
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

229
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,883
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very
hot.”

230
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:12,574
She’s young. I said, “But see, these are
two very important chakras. If you expose

231
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:20,576
them, then you’ll have problem.” She doesn’t
like to wear dresses which are above the knee,

232
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:23,096
but she says people wear even above the knee.

233
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:30,326
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them clothed, otherwise

234
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,324
if they are affected, we’ll have knee trouble.”

235
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:39,865
Immediately she changed, immediately. “Mother,
I’ll wear blouse from inside and something

236
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:48,120
from outside.” Immediately. Because she
knew this is a natural primordial taboo that

237
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:59,553
we should not expose ours - these two chakras
and these chakras. But, nowadays, the more

238
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:08,449
you have long legs, I don’t know, they have
shorter clothes. And I don’t understand

239
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:15,474
what is in the legs, the whole beauty is in
the legs or what?

240
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:22,940
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with
Me. She was wearing a burqa because she was

241
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:30,625
a Muslim. And by the time we landed in London,
she took out the burqa and the dress was much

242
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:41,229
above the knees. I said, “What kind of Muslim
woman is she? She’s worse than even Christians

243
00:30:41,254 --> 00:30:47,020
because they wouldn’t wear such a thing,
you know, to come out of the aeroplane, you

244
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:54,034
have to come down on the staircase.” No
lajja, no shame, nothing, shamelessness!

245
00:30:55,325 --> 00:31:05,168
So, sahaj dharma is that you have shame, you
have sense of shame. What you talk to others,

246
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:12,193
what you say to others, how you behave towards
them, in the sahaj dharma is alladhadayini.

247
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:21,641
If something is not alladhadayini, keep quiet.
Don’t say. What is the need? What is there

248
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:33,817
to be sarcastic? Showing off your brains in
your sarcasm. It’s not a sign of good breeding

249
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:41,443
that you talk sarcastically to others in a
sharp way. But if you talk sweetly, what’s

250
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:51,968
the harm? This sweetness comes from Radhaji.
Now, of course they have misused Her and made

251
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:58,993
Her into a sort of a Romeo-Juliet business.
It was not that. She was a very pure woman

252
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:10,569
and She was Mahalakshmi. So, to be a Mahalaksmi,
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

253
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:18,609
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly all right. Once I remember, I was

254
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:28,970
in a big party and one gentleman came and
he sat down, “Aaaaaah!”

255
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:31,675
I said, “What happened?”

256
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:38,675
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You. See these women, I’m fed up.

257
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:43,292
But You came, I felt such a relief.”

258
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:46,631
I said, “What is so relieving?”

259
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,222
“You are so serene.”

260
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:59,207
So, women are serene in sahaj dharma. They
are not stupid, frivolous, laughing at anything.

261
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:08,392
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh. I mean, there is

262
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:12,921
something laughable, all right, but some things
are not even laughable, they'll laugh. That’s

263
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:21,707
not the way. That can be ridiculous also,
can ridicule others. But laugh of appreciation,

264
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:32,416
laugh of enjoyment, is so pure and creates
such beautiful atmosphere. I think the whole

265
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:43,624
ecological problem is in our brains – [Hindi
words]. It is not outside. It is inside us,

266
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:45,732
which is reflected outside.

267
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:52,312
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

268
00:33:52,312 --> 00:34:01,396
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts to our behavior, to how we live. In

269
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:08,421
the sahaj dharma, you give up lust and greed
very easily, that I know. I mean if they can’t

270
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:14,292
even give up that, then they should not call
themselves Sahaja yogis. The first thing you

271
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:22,677
give up is lust and greed. I find it among
young people now, that those who come to Sahaja

272
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:33,967
Yoga become really very free people. They
don’t run after women. Women don’t run

273
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:40,822
after men. They are together, they sit together,
talk together, laugh together, but it is purity

274
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:50,815
that is here. In the Koran it’s described
that “When Kiyama will come, beautiful women

275
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,391
and beautiful men will be there, but they’ll
have no lust and greed, they’ll be pure.”

276
00:34:57,391 --> 00:35:08,071
Is today, you can see that that lust and greed
is finished in most of it, most of you. Automatically

277
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:15,582
it is finished and now you can see for yourself
that you’re free of this bondage.

278
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:35,644
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow. In
the sahaj dharma, first thing is very important

279
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:42,942
is forgiveness. If somebody cannot forgive,
then he cannot be a Sahaja yogi. Forgiveness.

280
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:55,104
How this forgiveness comes in is by forgetting
the past. Otherwise you’ll go on saying,

281
00:35:55,129 --> 00:36:01,542
“This person tortured me, that person tortured
me, he was very mean to me, he was that to

282
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:08,542
me, he did this to me.” Shows that you are
not of that caliber to understand Sahaja Yoga

283
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:14,972
- because you cannot forgive. What is there
to remember? The present is the best. Now

284
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:21,262
if you are sitting here with Me, enjoying
the alladhadayini shakti, that time if you

285
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:30,396
are thinking about the past, shows what? That
you are not of the caliber. To be the caliber

286
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:37,873
of Sahaja Yoga, you should be free of your
past. Finished. There's no need to confess.

287
00:36:37,898 --> 00:36:44,898
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to Me of confessions and I just said,

288
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:50,772
“Baba, just burn these letters. I don’t
remember. I don’t want to read anything

289
00:36:50,772 --> 00:36:51,887
about anything.”

290
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:57,802
So, there should be forgiveness. If there
is forgiveness, you’ll be surprised, you’ll

291
00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:04,151
feel very relieved and your married life will
be very happy. But if you try to remember

292
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:10,671
something – all right, some marriages are
really, really very difficult, all right,

293
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:17,671
so you get out. In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed
complete divorce, but must be with some reason,

294
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:21,232
not because you think something is superior.

295
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:27,202
Now we have banned many countries from where
we don’t want to have girls or from where

296
00:37:27,202 --> 00:37:32,472
we don’t want to have boys. What is the
reason? With experience we have learned, they

297
00:37:32,472 --> 00:37:45,527
are not marriage substance. Now, then better
not marry, and if you marry then live like

298
00:37:45,552 --> 00:37:54,586
an ideal Sahaja Yogi. Also, if you are a Sahaja
Yogini, then you can carry on very much better

299
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:57,552
by forgiving all the time.

300
00:37:57,552 --> 00:38:04,737
Every time, when people tell Me, “My Mother,
You see You must help me.”

301
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:05,212
“Why?”

302
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,931
“Because, You know my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

303
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:12,431
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind. He
must give you money. Why doesn’t he give

304
00:38:12,431 --> 00:38:13,332
you money?”

305
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:18,482
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say, “Mother,
she’s very extravagant.”

306
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:24,482
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

307
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:32,406
In sahaj dharma, the husband-wife’s relation
should be really romantic, should be really

308
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:38,881
beautiful. It is not, you know, we talk of
love and all that here, very rarely people

309
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:44,871
fall in love and carry on with it. It’s
a blessing if you really get that kind of

310
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:56,017
a feeling. But mostly it is a curse. So to
fall in love is very good but that doesn’t

311
00:38:56,042 --> 00:39:03,516
mean you forget that you are a Sahaja Yogi.
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,

312
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:10,621
in your married life. Same dharma is for your
children, that you bring up your children

313
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:19,156
not troubling them too much, but into a free
land. Let them use their wisdom. Sometimes

314
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:24,782
I know children go astray and try to follow
wrong things. Then you must correct them,

315
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:31,012
you must tell them, it’s your duty. They
were not born out of the trees but they were

316
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:36,802
born here, from the parents. So it’s the
duty of the parents to tell them that this

317
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:43,022
is wrong and this should not be done. It’s
a very wrong thing, you should correct them

318
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:47,681
and that correction should be in a Sahaj way.

319
00:39:47,681 --> 00:40:01,606
I’ll tell you an example. I had a problem
once with somebody coming to Me and saying,

320
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:06,654
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

321
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:13,675
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi, because smoking Sahaja Yogi

322
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:19,066
is a funny caricature, you know, I can’t
think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking. How will I

323
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:21,175
look if I start smoking like that?”

324
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:23,980
“Ah, horrible.”

325
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:30,456
I said, “Then if you are My son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.” He gave up smoking,

326
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:32,480
can you imagine?

327
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:40,715
So, dealing with children, always make yourself
an example, yourself part and parcel of that

328
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:53,336
event. So the children don’t feel, you know.
This is something that I have talked many

329
00:40:53,361 --> 00:41:01,445
a times. Children is one thing, I tell you,
they can give up everything but not your love.

330
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:12,251
If they know you love them they will not accept
anything that will make you not love - not

331
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:22,075
love them. This is for definite, because children
are the best people who know about love.

332
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:27,287
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that in
English language, I didn’t see many books

333
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:34,631
about children written beautiful, beautiful
things. There was one book that was published

334
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:40,917
when I was in London: The children talking
about the politicians, and they published

335
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:47,187
I think, 5000 books and that very same day
it was finished. So, talk to children, talk

336
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:53,287
to them. You’ll be amazed, they are full
of honey. They have such nice, nice things

337
00:41:53,287 --> 00:42:00,948
with them and when they talk like that, then
you are amazed how they say things, how they

338
00:42:00,973 --> 00:42:09,311
talk of Sahaj, how they are expressing their
spiritual strength.

339
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:24,282
Now, we have many very good children and also
they are absolutely Sahaj. One boy came and

340
00:42:24,307 --> 00:42:26,757
he just prostrated himself before Me.

341
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:29,937
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

342
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:36,911
“No, I was getting cool vibrations, Mother
from You, so I did it.”

343
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:39,247
“Is it, you like it?”

344
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:40,303
“Of course!”

345
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:41,787
“More than chocolate?”

346
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:43,211
“Of course!”

347
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:48,605
I was surprised. “What? You eat them or
what?”

348
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:56,729
“No need to eat, no, no, you feel so happy
inside and I feel, Mother, You are putting

349
00:42:56,754 --> 00:43:00,375
Your hand on my heart and trying to console
me.”

350
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:03,264
Surprised. “And where is your heart?”

351
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:11,429
He said, “Here, here is my heart, I feel
it here.” Just imagine, what love and what

352
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:16,655
understanding of Sahaja Yoga! For these little
children who are below even five years.

353
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:25,370
Now, you are all grown up children of Mine
and I want you to know all the beauties that

354
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:31,605
are within you, that you have to enjoy. First
of all, learn to laugh at yourself. That’s

355
00:43:31,605 --> 00:43:41,170
the best way to enjoy yourself, you know.
And not to spend much time on the mirror,

356
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:46,434
in the mirror, that’s another way. You spend
too much on the mirror, then something wrong

357
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:51,115
with you. I think, personally, that it’s
a kind of a possession maybe. So, what you

358
00:43:51,115 --> 00:44:02,020
should see inside, “Are we sahaj dharmis?
Mother has established sahaj dharma, much

359
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:07,825
more than what Krishna wanted to establish.
He wanted to establish the dharma of love

360
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:15,988
which of course we have, but apart from that
we have so many other beautiful facets and

361
00:44:16,214 --> 00:44:23,399
such beautiful things within our personality
that we have forgotten to enjoy.”

362
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:34,363
So, the attention should be on your own qualities,
on your own personality, and then you’ll

363
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:42,500
be amazed how your personality is giving you
joy, giving you alladha, giving you so much

364
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:49,305
of patience with others.

365
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:57,657
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke, because nothing so serious. It’s

366
00:44:57,673 --> 00:45:04,009
not a Rama’s type that you have to be serious.
I don’t have to kill anybody. I don’t

367
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:11,386
use any weapons in this lifetime. Without
weapons if things are solved, what can you

368
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:12,648
do?

369
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:18,535
But you must try to see the beauty as Sahaja
Yogis. You should be sensitive to see how

370
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:27,522
you have been helped, how you have been guided,
how you have been blessed. This is sahaj dharma.

371
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:33,985
If you cannot know that, then you live on
a very low level. I mean, it’s not fault

372
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:43,072
of Sahaja Yoga, but it’s your style, you
are not sensitive. Supposing somebody is not

373
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:53,389
- does not burn his hand. So what will you
do? He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,

374
00:45:53,414 --> 00:46:01,230
he cannot feel. He can drink, he can smoke,
he can do everything and still he's existing,

375
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:06,374
all right. Must be a rakshasa, I think or
I don’t know what to say.

376
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:15,548
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis and not from the bad ones and

377
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:25,439
how do we proceed in enjoyment - which is
a ocean, just a ocean. For example, now, I

378
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:32,185
came, everybody was trying to fan. But also
in the West another problem is they like to

379
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:38,055
live in hermetically-sealed rooms, hermetically-sealed
cars, they are very afraid of draft, I don’t

380
00:46:38,055 --> 00:46:43,584
know, as if they’ll be blown away or what
will happen to them. They don’t want draft.

381
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:50,855
I mean draft is not coming from some iceberg.
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air

382
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:59,040
at all and that’s one other reason that
people are very suffocating sometimes, you

383
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:04,094
know, they just suffocate. They are used to
a suffocating life.

384
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:11,530
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so somebody
was driving Me, but the person who was there

385
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:17,731
was from Western country. He said, “Don’t
open - don’t open the window.”

386
00:47:17,756 --> 00:47:19,036
I said, “Why?”

387
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,316
“There’s a draft.”

388
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:27,227
I said, “In this country, in India people
live in the open - what is a draft? What draft

389
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:32,207
you are talking about?” You can’t open
the door, you can’t open the window, you

390
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:38,187
can’t open anything, if you open anything,
they’ll be all dead, you see – as if.

391
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:40,496
So open yourself!

392
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:51,585
As it is about the nature, also it is in their
private lives. They don’t want to open.

393
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:57,311
If somebody comes to their house, “Oh my
God, now we’ll have to share the wines,

394
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:10,981
we’ll have to share the foods” They cannot
share. They cannot share. That is most uncollective.

395
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:19,761
But in India, I must say, people have a good
sharing capacity because they are still primitive,

396
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:32,934
they are still primordial, yet not gone out
of the way to satisfy their own ego. But I

397
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:48,816
think somehow or other in India, people like
to share. If you want to please any Indian,

398
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:53,385
you tell them, tomorrow I’ll come and have
food with you. His wife will jump. She’ll

399
00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:02,176
say, “Now what do you like, tell me, what
food do you like?” She will jump. But otherwise,

400
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:07,908
what happens, as soon as you say he’s coming
for food, the wife will say, “No, no, I

401
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:21,267
am going to my mother.” Immediately she’ll
have a program. I just don’t understand.

402
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:27,743
They’ll have beautiful houses, very clean,
very beautiful, everything, but if somebody

403
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:36,931
comes to their house, they get a shock as
if electricity has entered. So, for whom is

404
00:49:37,032 --> 00:49:38,903
all this?

405
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:45,903
To show off, they will borrow money from the
banks. Even Indians in America they do. They

406
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:55,728
want to have three Mercedes, four houses - for
what? Borrowing money with borrowing money

407
00:49:55,753 --> 00:50:05,718
they live. Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow
any money. There’s no need, you can do away

408
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:14,037
with things. Why to have so many cars? Nowadays,
people don’t even walk at all. We used to

409
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:21,517
go to our school, My father had a car in India
- nothing doing. We had to walk. We used to

410
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:28,493
climb one mountain. It was about five miles,
the school - every morning. Then in the night,

411
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:37,368
in the evening, the car used to come, and
I would walk with My bare feet, because so

412
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:44,393
much vibrations and on the chappals, I thought
were cutting my vibrations, so I used to have

413
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:51,403
chappals in My hand and walk. One day we had
a new driver, My father sent him. He said,

414
00:50:51,403 --> 00:50:56,852
“How will I know who is the daughter.”
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in

415
00:50:56,852 --> 00:51:01,153
Her hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

416
00:51:01,153 --> 00:51:12,158
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity. It’s very important. And

417
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:17,393
not to side with anyone. You are not identified
with anyone.

418
00:51:17,393 --> 00:51:23,753
It’s much better now, I think, because since
you have taken to sahaj dharma, I’ve seen

419
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:28,092
English will tell you what’s wrong with
English. Swiss will tell you what’s wrong

420
00:51:28,092 --> 00:51:32,743
with Swiss. Indians will tell you what’s
wrong with Indians. Actually, I learned from

421
00:51:32,743 --> 00:51:37,302
them. I don’t know these things are there.
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with

422
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:47,347
Russians. They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us? Where do we lack in this?”

423
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:57,452
Because the collectivity of being in one country,
say as an Indian, we see now, what’s happening

424
00:51:57,562 --> 00:52:04,332
in India, all corrupt, horrible, this, that.
So, I said, “All right, if you don’t like

425
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:09,022
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”
No, no, no, that - we will stay here, but

426
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:15,272
this is a very corrupt government they are,
it’s very bad, this, that. Anywhere you

427
00:52:15,272 --> 00:52:25,267
go, you will find immediately they see - because
you don’t know they are now chosen to change

428
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,112
their country.

429
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:36,678
I’ve taken up many questions now, of India
and I’m going to start working on that level.

430
00:52:36,703 --> 00:52:45,438
We've already started, in a way, for the destitute
women, then for other type of poverty and

431
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:51,443
all that. Just by saying, remove poverty,
poverty cannot be lost. You have to have feeling

432
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:58,443
for the poor, then only - but you get with
more that feeling because you are an Indian.

433
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:07,257
You are an Indian, so what? Your own brothers,
sisters starving. You get that very deep feeling

434
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:11,673
within you if you are a sahaj dharmi.

435
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:17,653
So, this is the new dharma we have established
now in this world. A new race, with a new

436
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:26,817
dharma, which is much above - even Shri Krishna’s
vision is coming true. He describes in the

437
00:53:26,842 --> 00:53:33,112
beginning. I think, He was not a good salesman,
because He describes the best first. You see

438
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:40,760
the salesman first will start from two rupees,
then go onward to two thousand. But He first

439
00:53:40,852 --> 00:53:47,582
told us that you have to become Sthita Pragya,
means Sahaja Yogi - and then Shri Krishna

440
00:53:47,582 --> 00:53:54,312
was asked a question by Arjuna, “What is
a Sthita Pragya?” Then He describes a Sahaja

441
00:53:54,312 --> 00:54:02,458
Yogi, that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that, now. Then the questions

442
00:54:02,483 --> 00:54:06,082
start. You know, Arjuna was a great questioner,
I think.

443
00:54:06,082 --> 00:54:10,567
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this and what about that and what about

444
00:54:10,592 --> 00:54:11,602
that?”

445
00:54:11,602 --> 00:54:19,458
So He goes on explaining to him that “You
see, this is all just a maya, this is all

446
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:27,057
an illusion you have. Get out of this illusion.
If once you get out of this illusion,” because

447
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:33,602
Arjuna said, “They are my relations, they
are my teachers. How can I kill them?”

448
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:38,832
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are

449
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:45,203
being killed because they are not following
the satya dharma, so it’s all right. What

450
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:49,362
is your brother, what is your sister? They
are not following the satya dharma, so you

451
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:54,046
have nothing to do with them. If you can correct
them and help them, it’s all right, otherwise

452
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,014
forget them.”

453
00:54:56,039 --> 00:55:03,497
First, deal with people who are straight.
Like we should say that we must deal with

454
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:10,767
people who are simple, innocent and then you
can take to difficult people when you are

455
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:14,943
that good. Otherwise you’ll come here saying,
“Mother, I have caught this, I have caught

456
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:22,738
that.” So, in sahaj dharma, you being the
spirit, you also know about others, very well

457
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:28,052
and you can make it out, who is who, what
chakras they are catching.

458
00:55:28,052 --> 00:55:39,010
But the trouble in America, I found that Sahaja
Yogis used to, just could go and tell somebody,

459
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,812
“You are catching on this chakra.” Now,
he has come for the first time and you tell

460
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:44,342
him, “You, you are very egoistical.”

461
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:46,503
He says, “How do you know?”

462
00:55:46,503 --> 00:55:50,132
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

463
00:55:50,132 --> 00:55:57,378
Is this the way to receive a new person? Is
this the way to talk to a new person? See,

464
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:03,213
on the contrary, you should say, “Come,
sit down, very nice, you are very great,”

465
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:10,239
see? Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of buttering, as you call it,

466
00:56:10,264 --> 00:56:18,918
you see, we call it chaplusi. Then, gradually,
because you are doing this just to make him

467
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:24,443
a Sahaja Yogi, because you love him. Basically
that is the reason. But as soon as somebody

468
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:29,663
comes in, if you tell him, “This is wrong
with you, that’s wrong with you.” This

469
00:56:29,663 --> 00:56:36,819
is not a pope’s business where you go on
telling people what’s wrong with them, go

470
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:44,517
and confess to all these silly people. It’s
not that. What we have to show that you have

471
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:51,564
fallen in love with that person; you are nice
to that person because you like that person.

472
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:57,864
Then gradually you pull him up. But as soon
as he comes you give him one shock, so finished.

473
00:56:57,864 --> 00:57:00,713
How can you have good relations?

474
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:04,703
Americans have to learn this. I don’t know
why Americans think they are very superior

475
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:12,458
people. I tell you for wisdom, I would not
say they are so good. It’s completely lacking

476
00:57:12,483 --> 00:57:21,329
– wisdom in them. And they misunderstand
people very fast. Start judging others, is

477
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:28,354
not the way you can have sahaj dharma. Sahaj
dharma is: you are your own. You are in your

478
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:32,359
own, you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy. Where is the time to criticize

479
00:57:32,384 --> 00:57:34,779
others?

480
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:43,759
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone. In that love you should

481
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:51,878
not show your pity, but love which is, again,
alladhadayini. This is the message of Shri

482
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:56,443
Krishna, but I don’t know how many understood
it. Now, what you find those who are following

483
00:57:56,443 --> 00:58:05,039
Shri Krishna like Hare Rama people, they are
really beggars on the street. He is Kubera,

484
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:11,473
and his disciples are all beggars, can you
imagine? Does it add to His glory as a Kubera?

485
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:21,277
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that. Should
be generous, should not bother too much about

486
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:29,799
yourself. Should not all the time think about
yourself, but think of the collectivity, how

487
00:58:29,824 --> 00:58:41,269
you behave. Collectivity is not to bring - force
people to come to Sahaja Yoga. Once they come

488
00:58:41,294 --> 00:58:46,574
to Sahaja Yoga they will know the joy of life
and you don’t have to tell them anything.

489
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:53,574
Nothing has to be told, just silently it will
work and they will feel your love.

490
00:58:53,778 --> 00:59:04,079
You see, love is something so great. It not
only helps others but it also helps you. It’s

491
00:59:04,104 --> 00:59:10,304
so joyous to give realizations to others.
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra

492
00:59:10,304 --> 00:59:14,193
is catching”, why you are giving realization?
If you don’t know how to give realization,

493
00:59:14,193 --> 00:59:25,218
better not do it. So, to criticize is not
the way we can enjoy love. Ah, of course you

494
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:31,923
can pull legs of each other sometimes, just
for fun’s sake, but not to harm, not to

495
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:41,098
torture, not to make that person fall. You
are all sahaj dharmis, you have accepted sahaj

496
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:53,907
dharma and in sahaj dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart, not hypocrisy - and

497
00:59:53,932 --> 00:59:56,569
sensible life.

498
00:59:56,594 --> 01:00:04,908
Now, this pope is against abortion. I’m
not. If a woman is suffering, let her have

499
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:12,509
abortion. The one who is living is more important
than who are not living. If somebody wants

500
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:20,562
to have abortion, that child can be born again.
According to us, nobody dies permanently.

501
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:25,764
Whatever it may be.

502
01:00:25,764 --> 01:00:36,348
So, this is one way they use it for propagation
of human beings. Like they say the Muslim

503
01:00:36,373 --> 01:00:41,614
women are like a factory. They go on producing
more children, more children, more children.

504
01:00:41,614 --> 01:00:49,018
So there are more voters. So the pope knows
that. That’s why he says, abortion, no.

505
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:55,964
Christians should not abort, because then
there will be less Christians to compete with

506
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,209
the Muslims.

507
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:08,220
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such funny,
radical, nonsensical things. We have divorce,

508
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:19,783
and we have also abortion, which is important
to understand that these are all taboos which

509
01:01:19,808 --> 01:01:30,285
are there. But not for people who have to
get out of the troubles - you have to have

510
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:37,546
it. And that’s how it works. But to be very
frank, we don’t have to do abortions, it

511
01:01:37,571 --> 01:01:47,684
is achieved by Paramchaitanya. Paramchaitanya
does for Me. I don’t have to. I don’t

512
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:52,230
have to do anything. It’s Paramchaitanya.
It’s nice, because it knows what is to be

513
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:58,405
done, how to achieve it. And sometimes you
are in trouble, then know that you are not

514
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:03,579
leaving things into the hands of the Paramchaitanya.
If you leave into the hands of Paramchaitanya

515
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:07,432
things will work out very well.

516
01:02:07,493 --> 01:02:13,753
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and foremost
thing is, how much you are enjoying yourself.

517
01:02:13,753 --> 01:02:22,057
How much enjoyment you are giving to others?
For that you have music, you have this, that.

518
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:37,927
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna
you can’t keep quiet. He played murli, basuri,

519
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:49,845
flute. Look at Him. I talked to Him, but He
just played murli. He didn’t talk so much,

520
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:56,519
except for the Gita, you won’t find Him
talking. And those who read also Gita are

521
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,900
horrible people, I tell you, I have met - those
who read Gita. They don’t understand what

522
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:06,640
is Shri Krishna’s dharma is. If they don’t
understand Shri Krishna, how will they understand

523
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:23,193
Sahaja Yoga? So, for all of you is to practice
on love, on forgiveness, on appreciating others,

524
01:03:23,218 --> 01:03:27,319
on giving joy to others.

525
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:33,489
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind
to Me also. Once I went to the shop to buy

526
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:43,532
a sari for Myself and the sari was very expensive
for My purpose. So, I didn’t buy. Said,

527
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:49,690
“Let it be. This color suits Me, all right,
but doesn’t matter.” I didn’t have so

528
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:56,901
much money to buy. So, that Sahaja Yogi bought
that sari and on My birthday gave Me - and

529
01:03:56,957 --> 01:04:02,777
really, I could not see it, because My eyes
were filled with tears. Just a small thing

530
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:11,839
like that. Normally I don’t expect you to
do anything for Me, no. But small, small things

531
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:17,882
make you so happy. But even if you do this
to somebody, may not understand, may not realize,

532
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:22,528
may not feel it. But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,
you will.

533
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:33,590
So thank you very much for all this that I
have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and

534
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:35,352
make others enjoy you.

535
01:04:35,377 --> 01:04:37,363
May God bless you!
