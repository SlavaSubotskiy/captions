1
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:25,542
Today is a great day for all of us

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,750
that we are celebrating Navaratri today

3
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:48,083
and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

4
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,917
When in Italy I said that

5
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:06,041
England is the heart of the universe,

6
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,125
they would not accept it.

7
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:12,291
They were very shocked at this statement.

8
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:19,166
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe.

9
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:26,166
One of the reasons was that they felt that

10
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:37,417
that the English people were invaded once by Romans,

11
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:45,250
and Romans at that time also had felt

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
that English were very bumptious people.

13
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
They would not even accept the defeat

14
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,083
with the grace of a person who is lost.

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,291
Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious.

16
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,000
So they could not believe how could it be

17
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,125
that the English is the heart of the universe.

18
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:11,125
If this is the heart, what's the situation of the universe?

19
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:17,792
And then they described to Me at length the bumptiousness of the English,

20
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:24,875
and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

21
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:31,542
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

22
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:35,083
there must be something special about it,

23
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:40,875
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

24
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,125
fully

25
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:51,792
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,750
that passes through the whole of the body.

27
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,625
So the cells of this heart,

28
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,625
which has made this great organ,

29
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:12,291
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

30
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:21,792
within a human body are the best cells,

31
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,500
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

32
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:36,041
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

33
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:42,417
the sound that is without percussion.

34
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:48,959
While we find

35
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:54,500
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

36
00:04:54,709 --> 00:05:00,250
but others talk more, show off more,

37
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,250
and do not have the caliber.

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,291
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

39
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:17,000
because you are born on the special land of England.

40
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:22,291
That possibility must be built within you.

41
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,417
But then what is lacking?

42
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,500
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

43
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,083
with all the great background,

44
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:42,250
with all the merits to be here,

45
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,625
why is it we find

46
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:51,875
that Sahaja yogis for years together do not come up to many others.

47
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,333
What is the reason?

48
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,458
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

49
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:05,125
and it moves with a certain sound,

50
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,834
and you can even get it on to a graph

51
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,333
and it is so systematic,

52
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:15,291
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

53
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,959
that even a slightest murmur,

54
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:23,834
or slightest change shows on the graph.

55
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,000
Is a very sensitive thing.

56
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:33,542
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart.

57
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:38,291
It's an erratic, funny heart

58
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,500
which swells up in ego.

59
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,542
And whatever one may talk,

60
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,917
this is another reading people have,

61
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:51,875
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you

62
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:56,250
and second moment it has no effect on them.

63
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,083
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

64
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:08,083
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

65
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:15,959
And that disciplining has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

66
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:25,542
But for all that, I think what we should have is innate intelligence.

67
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:29,125
No education, innate intelligence.

68
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:36,417
Innate intelligence to understand that our caliber has to improve.

69
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:45,250
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

70
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:52,166
the Spirit and not the Power.

71
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,041
The witness,

72
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,917
the one that watches,

73
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,083
that is the reflection of God,

74
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:10,458
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

75
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,875
Actually what happens

76
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:19,166
that without rising up to that status

77
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,542
if we also say,

78
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,166
"All right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit,"

79
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:32,583
then we do not achieve that caliber.

80
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,417
And with all the blessings,

81
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:42,667
like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams.

82
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,959
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

83
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,375
Only to take advantage

84
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,792
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

85
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,375
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

86
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:12,625
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

87
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,583
And warning has to be given now.

88
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:21,625
Very important is at this juncture

89
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:25,625
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

90
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,250
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

91
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:34,041
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

92
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,542
So don't get into bumptiousness.

93
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,500
First is your character, as everybody says,

94
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,959
"They are very bumptious."

95
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,583
Try to be humble

96
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,792
and then understand that you have to be in the plane

97
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:00,834
and not left behind on the grounds.

98
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,999
It is moving fast.

99
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:14,875
Now the most fortunate thing is

100
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,792
that today is the Navaratri

101
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,083
and that I should be in London

102
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,500
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here.

103
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,250
No other country is that privileged,

104
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:32,500
because this is the highest puja,

105
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:40,417
the greatest ritual, which you can attend.

106
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,458
So why do we do Navaratri?

107
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,625
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept

108
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:02,709
the powers of the Shakti,

109
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,500
to realize the power

110
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:13,542
that all these chakras have got in themselves,

111
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,959
and that when they are enlightened

112
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:20,834
how you can express all these powers

113
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:24,041
of these nine chakras within ourselves;

114
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,583
the seven chakras plus the heart and the moon makes it nine.

115
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,625
But I would say that

116
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:35,959
seven of these and on top of that we should say two more centers,

117
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:41,875
which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly.

118
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,375
Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers,

119
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:50,166
but let us at least talk of the seven centers.

120
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,792
The power of these centers,

121
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:57,999
have we been able to develop within ourselves?

122
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,333
How can you do it? You have no time.

123
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:06,250
You are all busy people and bumptious.

124
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,333
So now to develop these powers

125
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:16,125
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

126
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,125
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

127
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,208
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

128
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:27,125
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

129
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,166
any other nonsensical thing like

130
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,041
unemployment and all that.

131
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,041
They just asked Me,

132
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,583
"Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

133
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,250
or that chakra or that chakra?"

134
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,792
And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

135
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,834
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

136
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:57,458
specially in me this one is not all right." 

137
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,041
This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

138
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,625
Now for a realized soul

139
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,125
there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

140
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:51,625
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

141
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:56,834
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

142
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:02,083
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

143
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:07,166
Take it as a serious warning.

144
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,083
Now after Realization

145
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,166
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

146
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,083
because you have got the light,

147
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:25,875
you have known what is Realization,

148
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,458
you have known what it means to be realized,

149
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,542
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

150
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:40,208
how much your personality has improved.

151
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,417
But, there is something more that has to be done.

152
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,583
Is to see for yourself,

153
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:57,375
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

154
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,208
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

155
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,750
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

156
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:08,917
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

157
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,000
It is you, who is a realized soul,

158
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,208
you are your own master,

159
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:22,125
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

160
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,250
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

161
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,625
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

162
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,834
Think of it.

163
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:42,041
And here you are bumptiously giving lectures, talking bumptiously.

164
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,500
Very embarrassing even for the deities.

165
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,166
They don't know what to do, whether to garland you or to shut your mouth.

166
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:59,166
Here you are who have been,

167
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,417
here you are in such a great position

168
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,959
that you have got Realization.

169
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:29,959
That only thing you have to accept

170
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:36,375
the beauty of this great yoga,

171
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:44,166
that you just enlighten your own powers,

172
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,208
which are on these seven chakras.

173
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,083
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri,

174
00:16:54,458 --> 00:17:00,709
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

175
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,500
Gauri's power.

176
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,208
Tremendous they are, aren't they?

177
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,291
Because of Her power you have got your Realization.

178
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,041
Now what have we done

179
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,999
to enshrine that power within ourselves?

180
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,875
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,

181
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,750
let us see what have we done?

182
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:39,709
Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?

183
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,625
When people talk, they are so sharp.

184
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,083
How can you be sharp, if you are innocent?

185
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,291
They are so bumptious.

186
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:56,417
How can you be that, if you are innocent?

187
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,250
People play games.

188
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
How can you do that, if you are innocent?

189
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:03,875
Harm each other.

190
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,875
How can it be, if you are innocent?

191
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,291
So first of all you have to see yourself,

192
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,999
that the power of innocence, if it has to live,

193
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,333
all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

194
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,583
If you want to have the innocence,

195
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:30,000
all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

196
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,834
I can understand about people, who are ignorant,

197
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,250
who have ignorance.

198
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:40,500
Then in ignorance, of course how will they talk of innocence.

199
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,375
But you are not ignorant people. You are knowledgeable,

200
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,208
you've got your enlightenment.

201
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,542
And the power of innocence is so great.

202
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:55,250
It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious, but fearless.

203
00:18:55,542 --> 00:19:00,792
And the greatest thing of innocence is that you are respectful.

204
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,709
The sense of respect,

205
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,750
if it is not developed within you,

206
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:14,417
if you cannot develop the sense of respect for other Sahaja Yogis,

207
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,792
for other people, for the ashrams, for the discipline

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,667
and your own self-respect,

209
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,750
then it is of no use, even talking of Sahaja Yoga,

210
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,583
because that is the very beginning of it.

211
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:36,250
First you do not respect, all right, you are bumptious, all right,

212
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:42,500
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it,

213
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,208
riding a fast horse,

214
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,709
all that is there is all right, is forgiven.

215
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,417
But once you have seen the light,

216
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:57,458
you must try to get rid of all the snakes

217
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,917
that you have been holding on to.

218
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,125
Is a simple thing.

219
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,041
In your childlike nature only,

220
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:15,542
you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

221
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,500
You have to be really childlike,

222
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:24,500
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

223
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,875
because you think you're too clever.

224
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,417
To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

225
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,000
what's the use of talking to such a person,

226
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,750
because he already knows everything.

227
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,667
So the first power when you develop,

228
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:42,709
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

229
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,291
You must respect the Mother Earth,

230
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:49,041
because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

231
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:55,166
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth.

232
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,250
And the respect.

233
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:04,291
See the trees when they get their flowers,

234
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,458
they are not so respectful,

235
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,750
but when they are laden by the fruits,

236
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,291
they bow down to Mother Earth.

237
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:21,208
In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

238
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,834
you all must bow down.

239
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,959
And innocence has a special capacity

240
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,542
to make a person extremely peaceful,

241
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,583
extremely peaceful.

242
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:45,417
All the anger, temper, violence -

243
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,125
if a person doesn't have innocence,

244
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:54,291
it cannot come in you,

245
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,625
because a person who is not innocent

246
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:03,333
is either sly or aggressive.

247
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,250
He cannot have peace within his heart.

248
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,709
But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives,

249
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:17,208
he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony.

250
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:27,375
But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

251
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,917
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid,

252
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,834
I have a right to shout at that person."

253
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:41,125
And the one who is not innocent is never wise.

254
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:44,750
He may be to look at look sharp, but he is not wise.

255
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:49,125
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

256
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:53,333
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

257
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,917
That is what one has to see.

258
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:03,250
When your power

259
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:07,917
of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent.

260
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,875
People say, "That fellow is very wise." 

261
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,917
For example if somebody is crying about his wife,

262
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,542
a wise person will say, "Oh, Baba,

263
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:21,750
just look at this, still busy with his wife."

264
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,999
Another one is crying about his house or something.

265
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:29,041
He will say, "Oh, look at this one, still busy with the house."

266
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:34,250
There is no end to it.

267
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:42,959
I've known people who get so swollen up

268
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:48,709
that they think they must give a big lecture for one hour,

269
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,000
on Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,625
Unless and until they have given one hour lecture,

271
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:59,041
they do not think their ego has manifested itself fully.

272
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,917
But a wise person,

273
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:07,667
he doesn't have to talk or speak or do anything.

274
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,999
He impresses his silence,

275
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,999
his wisdom on others much more easily.

276
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
That is what we have to see,

277
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:22,125
have we been able to discipline ourselves?

278
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:26,750
Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it.

279
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:30,625
We have to grow quite a lot

280
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,792
And people don't understand this point

281
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,834
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

282
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:43,875
that you have to grow, you have not yet grown.

283
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,750
You have to grow a lot.

284
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,083
And when you grow

285
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:56,792
you find this wisdom really fragrant with compassion.

286
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:01,500
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

287
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,625
Such beautiful compassion

288
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:10,750
can emit through your being,

289
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:14,166
that anybody who comes in contact with you,

290
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:18,250
will feel your auspiciousness.

291
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:26,166
But, again, you must give due respect

292
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,709
to your Self Realization and to your Self.

293
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:33,917
That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

294
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,125
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid.

295
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,792
I said, "What's the matter with this gentleman?

296
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,999
His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?"

297
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,834
Then I found out that he says he doesn't need any meditation.

298
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:53,583
He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

299
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,750
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation.

300
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:03,959
Is easy to explain, but whom are you explaining?

301
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,834
You have to explain to yourself,

302
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:12,375
only yourself, nobody else wants your explanation.

303
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,709
It's like missing the plane.

304
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,250
When you miss the plane

305
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,250
whom are you going to explain, the plane has left.

306
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,208
So then you have to explain yourself only.

307
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:31,000
You will tell the air, or to the gangway,

308
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,999
or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that,

309
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:37,709
there was this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that."

310
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,333
But the plane is gone.

311
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:45,583
Whom are you explaining?

312
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:55,458
So everyone should meditate every day.

313
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,250
That is a very important thing,

314
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:05,208
which people are doing in all the countries where I am not.

315
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:09,709
Because I am in England, people take Me for granted.

316
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,999
"Mother is doing everything."

317
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,999
So I get up at 4 o'clock, take My bath, meditate for you all.

318
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,542
I better start doing that again.

319
00:27:19,834 --> 00:27:21,458
Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

320
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:25,000
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

321
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,792
So everyone must today promise to Me

322
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:32,083
that they will meditate every day.

323
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,333
Get up in the morning!

324
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,083
"We can't get up in the morning."

325
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,999
The whole world can get up, why not the English?

326
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,041
But when it was the war of Waterloo,

327
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,917
they were the first to arrive there.

328
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,166
They won the war because they were so punctual.

329
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:56,291
What has happened to their punctuality today?

330
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:07,959
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers,

331
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,583
we don't sleep late,

332
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,208
so why shouldn't we decide today

333
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:19,250
that, "Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation.

334
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:25,250
And while meditating I must concentrate on myself and not on others.

335
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,166
And see for myself what is catching,

336
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,375
where am I catching, which chakra I am catching,

337
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,834
what have I to do?" 

338
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,500
So on this day of Navaratri,

339
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:38,667
today as the first day,

340
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:45,542
the Gauri's power must be enlightened within us, and they must express.

341
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,291
And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

342
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,750
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

343
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,458
She acts in the Mother Earth,

344
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,999
She acts in the universe,

345
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,792
She acts in the animals,

346
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:06,125
She acts in the matter,

347
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,792
She acts in the human beings,

348
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,917
and now She acts in you.

349
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:19,041
She is the One who decides

350
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,750
the face and the figure that you are going to have.

351
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:26,709
She is the One who decides what child you should have.

352
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,917
She is the One

353
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:33,000
who gives you the particular type of a child that you need.

354
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,917
She is the One who has got you all these beautiful children.

355
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:38,999
She is the One

356
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,542
who has given you these sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

357
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,625
All this She has done for you,

358
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:51,625
but what about the Power that you have within yourself.

359
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,583
How much have you manifested that?

360
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,625
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt.

361
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,125
But what about you, the individuals,

362
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,083
who have got their own Kundalini awakened?

363
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:07,000
How far you have opened Her out.

364
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:10,500
And what is Kundalini, is a simple thing as you know.

365
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,500
Is the true desire.

366
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,667
So true desire to perfect yourself, to grow yourself.

367
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:21,875
If it is really true desire, nothing else is important.

368
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,875
All other desires are secondary and tertiary.

369
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,375
The most important desire is to grow.

370
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:38,375
And for whose advantage ? Is the advantage of yours

371
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:43,041
and in your advantage only, the advantage of the whole world rests.

372
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:48,750
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe,

373
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,750
the growth of the human race.

374
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,792
Do you follow this point

375
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:58,999
that you are playing such an important role,

376
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,166
role at such a crucial time

377
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:07,750
when the world is about to collapse?

378
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:15,917
And you have great seers like William Blake,

379
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,999
you had such great people who have talked about this time.

380
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,250
They have built it up, traditionally we have built up all this -

381
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,125
now, in England.

382
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,500
The work of ages that has brought this England to gestate...

383
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:43,083
Now, do you realize

384
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:49,667
that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

385
00:31:54,208 --> 00:32:00,583
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness

386
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:06,667
without understanding your Self,

387
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:11,959
how can you talk so loud?

388
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:17,375
How can you think of organizing everything

389
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:23,417
when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

390
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:30,208
So today I am not going to take the count of the people,

391
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,917
who meditate every day or not.

392
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,417
But I can tell you this much,

393
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:39,959
next year those who do not meditate everyday,

394
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,875
you will not be here anymore.

395
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,166
Take it from Me.

396
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,083
Is a fact.

397
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:55,417
Every day you must meditate.

398
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,667
Discipline yourself.

399
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:02,999
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

400
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,959
You have come to a new vision.

401
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:10,208
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

402
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,375
you cannot just stand there.

403
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,709
Get into it!

404
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,583
Everyone says, Damle was saying too, everybody says

405
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:35,999
that, "Mother you have spent so much time for these English.

406
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,583
Why so much time for them?"

407
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,500
Maybe you might be thinking that because you are very great,

408
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,500
that's why I have to serve you people.

409
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,999
Think the way you like.

410
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:04,375
But the most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart,

411
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:09,458
and I have to cleanse you more, much more than others.

412
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,709
But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast.

413
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:18,917
I am amazed, their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding.

414
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:24,417
And they have just mastered it; every one of them.

415
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:31,375
Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff

416
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,375
and everybody doesn't want to understand Sahaja Yoga,

417
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:38,458
but everyone wants to give a lecture.

418
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,500
There is no respect for elders.

419
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,125
No respect who is older who is younger,

420
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,999
and somebody who thinks that

421
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:55,542
because they got Realization before others they are higher,

422
00:34:55,792 --> 00:35:02,250
then remember one word of Christ, that, "First will be the last."

423
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,917
So try to understand that it is you who has to grow,

424
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:14,375
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

425
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,166
Manifestation of the power,

426
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:20,250
I don't know how far you have understood.

427
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:23,959
When a person who has Gauri's power,

428
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,834
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

429
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:32,041
everybody's Kundalini rises, just to salute.

430
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:43,250
When you have Gauri's power

431
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:48,959
then you stand out because you have that innocent,

432
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:54,667
lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

433
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,500
and wherever you turn your eyes,

434
00:35:56,792 --> 00:36:02,542
even one glance would raise the Kundalini, immediately.

435
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,458
People who suffer from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease,

436
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,625
all can be cured in no time

437
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,625
if you have developed only one power of Gauri.

438
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,999
All your problems can be solved.

439
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,542
Negativity will go away

440
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:29,625
and you will become like a lotus.

441
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:35,083
Beautiful, fragrant,

442
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,917
overpowering all kinds of negativity.

443
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:45,083
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me

444
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:48,917
and now I have become egoistical."

445
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,041
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

446
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,500
he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

447
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,291
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

448
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,041
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things.

449
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:10,375
But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

450
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,917
So the power, the power of assimilation of good,

451
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:22,917
the power of emission of good,

452
00:37:23,125 --> 00:37:29,375
all these powers are just in your complete reach.

453
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:35,709
But all this should not become a praise

454
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,583
but should become a kind of a challenge,

455
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:44,083
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

456
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:47,792
and an advancement for you.

457
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,709
But we are going down, I must tell you,

458
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:54,792
we are going down in England.

459
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,417
Because we have some funny tags,

460
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,792
funny people who are all the time with tags.

461
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:05,542
Such people will have to be warned,

462
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:10,792
and later on may be declared, as these people have decided,

463
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,750
should be declared as blacklisted.

464
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,333
It's a very sad day today for Me

465
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,542
and that is why the whole place is filled with -

466
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,917
I mean I had no mind to have the puja here,

467
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,375
because I am really very sad.

468
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:30,166
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are,

469
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:33,208
people are just in a picnic way in England,

470
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,959
I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

471
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:47,583
I have always been extremely enamored,

472
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:53,999
and I have already put up a big show of appreciating your efforts.

473
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:59,375
But if you see in the substance of it;

474
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,041
just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

475
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:09,083
Each individual should see the substance that is within us.

476
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,125
We are worried about a friend,

477
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:17,999
a fiancèe or a wife or a husband or this and that.

478
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:21,625
That's not the caliber.

479
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,959
The caliber is very low and is going down lower.

480
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,750
That's not a good thing, is not good.

481
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:37,667
If My love and compassion is spoiling you, I better pull you out of it.

482
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,917
Because you are capable

483
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,667
of your merits to be born in this country.

484
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,625
You are capable of very great heights.

485
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,625
I know that.

486
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,083
Of very great heights, which you can achieve.

487
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,834
But not by talking about it or thinking about it,

488
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,542
but by becoming that great power,

489
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,709
to become that power.

490
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:09,041
And see the collective blessings people have

491
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,667
and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

492
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:14,250
they have got that blessing.

493
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:19,083
I mean unlimited blessings they have got.

494
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,834
And why can't we have that here?

495
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:27,458
What's the problem with us?

496
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:32,500
If we are not collective, if there is a problem between ourselves,

497
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:36,125
that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between

498
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,583
that is keeping us out.

499
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:47,542
So let us now, promise within our heart

500
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,583
that this has to go into our heart,

501
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:56,375
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

502
00:40:56,709 --> 00:41:00,083
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

503
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,208
when this thing has happened,

504
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:06,834
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

505
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,917
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

506
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,166
that we have risen so high.

507
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:19,792
But now let us spread our wings, but we are cutting them down.

508
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,999
Don't become small-minded people,

509
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,667
worried about small, small things here and there.

510
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:27,917
Nothing is important.

511
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,208
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

512
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,999
you have had all kinds of trips,

513
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:37,917
you have done every kind of marriages, you have done every kind of

514
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:42,041
other nonsensical thing that people waste time with.

515
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,542
It's over now, finished. Now you do something new.

516
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:49,333
How many people you have married in previous lives

517
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:52,750
and how many houses you had in previous lives

518
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:56,375
and how many pleasures you have had,

519
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,792
finished now - finish it.

520
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:07,917
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara

521
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,250
where you have to grow. That's the point is, the season is that.

522
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:16,208
In this season if you do not grow,

523
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,417
you won't grow.

524
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:23,458
You have to take full advantage.

525
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,166
With full intensity

526
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,999
you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:32,375
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

528
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,999
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense in everything.

529
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,875
But there is no intensity.

530
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:40,667
Munich I decided just,

531
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,583
I don't know if Warren has told you - Munich

532
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,375
"You didn't tell them about Munich?"

533
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,750
All right - Munich. I decided last minute,

534
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,041
because there was a horrid one

535
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,500
who had come from Munich and had told Me

536
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:56,875
that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

537
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,834
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant.

538
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:00,500
I said I am not going to Munich.

539
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:05,041
But in Vienna I just felt the vibrations of Munich.

540
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,000
And I was amazed. I said, "All right, I am going to Munich."

541
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,166
We had to run up and down to get My visa,

542
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:15,417
this thing. Everything worked out, as usual.

543
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:19,125
And in that short time, three days,

544
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,458
four hundred people were there.

545
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:27,250
And so intense, I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense,

546
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:31,542
and they were listening to every word I was saying,

547
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:34,667
and picking up as pearls,

548
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,250
precious as diamonds,

549
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:41,208
every word they were noting it down.

550
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,083
And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people.

551
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,041
Imagine the Germans, coming over you people, English.

552
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,291
What will happen to you?

553
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,792
They are people of determination.

554
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,291
If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good.

555
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:03,333
They are not like this.

556
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,750
And then when I left them,

557
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:09,750
for one hour they were in the hall, just stunned,

558
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:13,208
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

559
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:20,417
But here as soon as I go away,

560
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:23,125
people start discussing something so nonsensical.

561
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,917
I hear it. I know the vibrations and everything.

562
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:31,417
We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

563
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:35,333
That is what is called as Shraddha.

564
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:41,417
Is important, very important.

565
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:49,083
And I am sure this year you will make it a point

566
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:54,625
to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

567
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,041
That intensity is lacking.

568
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:03,625
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past

569
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:07,458
and you are conditioned about it, or you think about it.

570
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,166
How can I do it, it is too much.

571
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:16,417
You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

572
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:21,166
Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga.

573
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,750
You are being completely renovated

574
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,542
but just use your mechanism.

575
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:32,375
I have worked so hard with you people

576
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,875
that nothing wrong with your mechanism.

577
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:38,999
Only thing you have no faith in yourself.

578
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,291
And those who do not have faith in themselves

579
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,625
are always bumptious people.

580
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:50,500
So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

581
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:56,333
within your heart and try to develop your powers,

582
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,542
inner powers, not of talking and showing off,

583
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,792
but inner powers.

584
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:11,709
Still so many are possessed, you know that.

585
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:14,583
It's a shameful thing

586
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:18,250
that even now in the temple of God there are people

587
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:23,125
who are possessed by horrible evil things.

588
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:26,125
How can it be?

589
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:32,208
You are the carrier of all these, even now, how can it be?

590
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,709
So one has to be very intensely there,

591
00:46:39,999 --> 00:46:42,375
and those today who are looking to be nothing,

592
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,917
will grow into something so great,

593
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:47,750
that you will be amazed at yourself.

594
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:51,625
"How is it I have become so great?"

595
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:56,709
But the first and foremost thing is disciplining.

596
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,083
Discipline yourself.

597
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,792
When it comes to eating, some people eat too much.

598
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:06,917
When it comes to talking, some people talk too much.

599
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:10,750
Or they do not talk at all, or they eat not at all.

600
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:13,125
All this is indiscipline.

601
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:16,542
But going higher to this spiritual life,

602
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,542
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit

603
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,750
and you are disciplined automatically.

604
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:25,458
Let the Spirit rule you.

605
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:30,166
It's possible. It's possible,

606
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,667
because I have seen in such a short time

607
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:37,208
and when I have been there for such a short time,

608
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,625
I don't even know their names.

609
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,999
Here practically I know all of you,

610
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:46,291
by your names, and by your vibrations also.

611
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:50,166
And they have gone up so much.

612
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,500
So, today is a great day.

613
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:56,125
Of course a great privilege.

614
00:47:56,417 --> 00:48:01,792
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

615
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,041
Is true, but may be,

616
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:09,250
one day may come when this House of Lords may be banished completely.

617
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:12,917
You have to behave like lords.

618
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:19,041
That is why My humble request is

619
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,500
that you must learn

620
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,999
to worship discipline.

621
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,333
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

622
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,875
You know what is to be done.

623
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,999
And then on top of that, you should not tell Me,

624
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:36,166
"I know, I should have, I know."

625
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:41,291
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

626
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:46,041
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

627
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,000
and in our ascent,

628
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:51,834
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

629
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,959
and in our hearts decide

630
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:57,917
that, "I am going to discipline myself." 

631
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:05,583
May God bless you.

632
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:23,250
Navaratri is beginning with a big force.

633
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:28,583
But vibration-wise is good,

634
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,667
Vibrations are very strong today.

635
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:33,999
Tremendous.

636
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:37,333
And you take full advantage of them.

637
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,709
If you want, you can use your left hand or right hand,

638
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:43,375
whichever way you like.

639
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:46,583
If you wish put your left hand towards Mother

640
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:53,792
and right hand on the earth. Or, left hand...

641
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:58,417
I would say it is left hand, mostly.

642
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,250
Even those who look egoistical are

643
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,458
under the power of some sort of a possession.

644
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:09,625
And they are even worse than people who are really egoistical

645
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:13,333
because they are themselves not aware at all

646
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:16,542
what they are talking about.
