1
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:28,714
We are living in these modern times

2
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:31,699
which are very eventful

3
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:43,027
In last 50 or 60 years so many things have happened

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:56,240
and the churning should bring forth many truths before us

5
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:13,826
First we have to realize that man has separated from each other.

6
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,581
The relationships that existed once upon a time

7
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:27,463
are no more to be found today.

8
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:41,467
And on the collective level we are waiting for a shock.

9
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:51,853
God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall upon us.

10
00:02:56,649 --> 00:03:02,649
Loudly. God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall.

11
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:04,434
You can come here, better.

12
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:18,414
And in these uncertain times only

13
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:26,983
we have to realize that there must some way out.

14
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:42,393
The way we understand through our mental projections,

15
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:52,567
the solution is not in the view.

16
00:03:56,468 --> 00:04:02,828
The solution that we think is the solution becomes a bondage, a system.

17
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,400
We try to break one system and build up another one

18
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:19,329
and that's how we find ourselves

19
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:22,434
miserably caught up into these systems.

20
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:37,948
So there has gone something wrong in our understanding of the problem.

21
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,169
We have to little bit stand back

22
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:49,339
and see what mistake we must have committed.

23
00:04:56,609 --> 00:05:01,849
Once upon a time I came to Belgium on a ship,

24
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:05,034
it was a very thriving shipping company.

25
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:17,674
All that is showing us

26
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:24,154
that even our economic enterprises come to a halt.

27
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:44,880
Now other enterprises on the emotional basis

28
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:56,162
or on the physical basis are giving us a feeling of confusion.

29
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:06,474
Like today only a gentleman told me

30
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:10,390
that allopathic medicines are rather dangerous.

31
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:20,561
So I said: "What is the solution you have for it?"

32
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,554
The reason the cement is very dangerous

33
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:30,754
because it retains lot of moisture.

34
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:40,534
Then he said that the plastic is very dangerous ...

35
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,329
Ultimately it looked as if everything that we eat or live into

36
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,274
seems to be a dangerous spot.

37
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:09,079
Now we should understand that the progress that we have made so far

38
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,196
is recoiling back upon ourselves.

39
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:24,064
As if the progress was linear.

40
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:31,475
I went to Houston 10 years back nobody would look at you.

41
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,714
Nobody would look at you, there were so rich you see.

42
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,994
Dynasty and all that, in Houston.

43
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:50,756
And today they told me if anybody is willing to pay even the amount

44
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:55,114
we have to pay to the bank we are willing to sell our houses.

45
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:10,974
This ask for oil, oil, oil, oil, now they don't want oil.

46
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:22,794
Then in the science we discovered atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb,

47
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:24,794
all kinds of things.

48
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:35,401
Then we have discovered our computers.

49
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:43,211
And now we are worried that this computer will take over us.

50
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,508
Everything is getting out of control.

51
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,994
Where does the control lie?

52
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:08,601
We talk of peace but how will you establish it?

53
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,765
There is a control within us.

54
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:21,097
We can control everything.

55
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:28,334
First we have to be in control with ourselves.

56
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,940
First we have to know ourselves.

57
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:42,408
And this feeling is very fashionable I should say.

58
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,058
So many people are seeking the truth.

59
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:58,242
Is a special quality of human beings who are seekers.

60
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:09,119
And when they try to seek the idea goes to the market as usual.

61
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,316
It goes to the market, the idea.

62
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:23,397
So the demand is there for somebody to guide you in your seeking.

63
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:32,681
So you have people who provide a kind of a market.

64
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:39,681
You get so many money spinning gurus,

65
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:50,970
they talk to you about peace and happiness and emancipation.

66
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:57,868
But you have to pay.

67
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:02,834
Today somebody told me in the car that the people who

68
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:06,674
were telephoning asked how much do we have to pay.

69
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,860
How much did you pay to Christ?

70
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:26,134
How much are you going to pay for the love of God?

71
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,800
Is nothing human that you can purchase it.

72
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,209
The seekers if they realize one little point

73
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,954
that you cannot pay for it, for your evolution you cannot pay.

74
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:50,274
That's one point, if you realize, half of the work is done.

75
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:07,089
The second point is that it is your evolution

76
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:11,714
which is a living force, of living divine.

77
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:23,969
This living force which has made you from amoeba stage

78
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,874
to human being is going to make you something higher.

79
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,649
The living force that has created these beautiful flowers,

80
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:42,474
how much did these flowers pay to that?

81
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:54,242
How much did they pay for it? Or how much did they exert for it?

82
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,399
So this evolution has to be spontaneous.

83
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:07,397
Effortless.

84
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,758
And that is what is Sahaja.

85
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:17,234
'Saha' means 'with' and 'ja' means 'born with you'.

86
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,965
It is born with you, the power.

87
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,290
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

88
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:43,289
So every human being has a right to get to that state

89
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:46,074
where you become one with the divine.

90
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,160
We have heard about the all-pervading divine power.

91
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,809
Right from Lao Tse to Christ to Buddha,

92
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,674
all of them have talked about it.

93
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:22,215
We did not know about the ether before.

94
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:32,971
But we have heard about the Divine power, which is all-pervading.

95
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:44,274
Once you are united with it, connected with it,

96
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:53,392
then only you realize that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

97
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:06,089
But before that it's only talk, talk of religion,

98
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,994
talk about all philosophies, it's just a talk.

99
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:21,574
Without any experience of this Divine power,

100
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:27,369
if we are going to believe into these talks and these dogmas

101
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,594
also these mental projections

102
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:35,674
we reach a state where we will say we don't believe in it.

103
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:50,477
But this is not the way to know the Divine.

104
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:58,634
In the Bible it is said that, "I will appear before you

105
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,634
like tongues of flames."

106
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,889
In the Koran it is said that at the time of resurrection

107
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,138
your hands will speak.

108
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:22,529
You'll be surprised in the Koran, more chapters are dedicated

109
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:27,154
to the resurrection time than to the doomsday.

110
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:41,951
They talk of the doomsday because that is how you frighten people.

111
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:49,452
So this resurrection has to come first.

112
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:58,689
Of course in all the Indian scriptures it is described

113
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:05,129
that the only way to be in charge,

114
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:09,874
to be in control yourself is through Self-realization.

115
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,080
We do not know ourselves.

116
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:28,126
People get cancer, they don't know they have cancer.

117
00:17:32,422 --> 00:17:37,222
People get mad, schizophrenic, they don't know they are mad.

118
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,689
They don't know because they don't know their body,

119
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:46,434
they don't know themselves.

120
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:55,172
So to find out about ourselves we have to go inside.

121
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:03,284
By going outside you cannot find out.

122
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,252
How do you go inside?

123
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:12,884
You are all paying attention to me.

124
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:18,154
But if I say please pay attention to yourself, you'll say, "How?".

125
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:26,278
You cannot take your attention inside.

126
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:32,489
But you must know: the One who has made us

127
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:35,794
has put all that in image within us.

128
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,489
As the one who has made this instrument

129
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,954
has also left the connection there.

130
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,888
So it has just to be plugged to the mains, that's all.

131
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:58,109
Then it works, fantastically.

132
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:03,009
Only we are not connected to mains, that's all.

133
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,794
There's nothing else to be done.

134
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,369
Once you are connected to the mains

135
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:16,529
you'll get all your physical benefits,

136
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:22,085
mental benefits, emotional benefits and spiritual benefits.

137
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:33,564
I'll tell you about the spiritual.

138
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:44,187
The spiritual benefit is that you get awakened to a new awareness.

139
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:53,593
That on your central nervous system

140
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:58,895
you can feel the collective consciousness.

141
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:12,787
That you can feel yourself and you can feel others within yourself.

142
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,063
We have a force within us

143
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:26,938
which is the power of pure desire.

144
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,794
Is not an impure desire.

145
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:41,209
As you know in economics it is said that the power, the

146
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:47,169
satisfaction out of anything passes on from one to another.

147
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:51,538
Like I want to buy a house then I want to buy a car

148
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,633
then I want to buy that, I am never satisfied.

149
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:56,428
So in general it is never satiable.

150
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:14,969
But the pure desire within us is the desire to be one with the divine

151
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:19,153
so that we get into the eternal life.

152
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,546
This desire has to be awakened.

153
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,225
Once it is awakened in this human awareness

154
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,610
you can feel on your central nervous system

155
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:53,165
these centers that are within your body

156
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,404
which are subtle centers

157
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:09,885
and when they are in any way in trouble you get all these problems.

158
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:20,615
You can feel them on your fingertips.

159
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,529
It's something in English, to feel something on your fingertips,

160
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,183
means it is very easy.

161
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,489
So you feel it on your fingertips,

162
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:40,834
your own centers which are in trouble.

163
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:50,514
And you feel the centers of another person.

164
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,809
Then if you know how to correct them

165
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:03,555
in a very simple way, maybe just rubbing.

166
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:12,614
And which are these centers.

167
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:18,924
You can correct everything that is physical, mental and emotional.

168
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:29,834
That's how you come in control of yourself, you control yourself.

169
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:39,834
We are at a stage which I can describe you with an analogy.

170
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:52,021
Like in the car you have got a brake and an accelerator.

171
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,609
In that way in our body also there are two nadis, two systems,

172
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:03,307
two channels, left and right which act

173
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:06,794
as the brake and the accelerator.

174
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,420
In the autonomous nervous system the left and the right sympathetic.

175
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:25,953
The central part is for our evolution.

176
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:36,049
So once we learn how to use the accelerator and also the brake

177
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:41,379
we become a driver. That means we come in the center.

178
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:54,729
That means we become evolved enough to be

179
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,074
automatically driving the car.

180
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:07,101
But then there is the master sitting behind.

181
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:15,674
Second stage you become the master.

182
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:21,169
And you see the driver in you and

183
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:26,922
you see the brake and the accelerator.

184
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,704
And you are in charge.

185
00:25:37,228 --> 00:25:45,228
In the same way today I hope today many of you will become in charge.

186
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:56,433
It is a very simple spontaneous matter.

187
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:03,889
Like I would say if you have to put lights,

188
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:05,969
so beautiful, so many beautiful lights

189
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:10,394
you have to just put on one switch and then everything gets light.

190
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:18,570
But behind that is a big history.

191
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:25,410
Behind that there is a big organization.

192
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:29,849
I need not explain all that to you.

193
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,153
It's better to put on the light first.

194
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:41,752
And it has worked.

195
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:46,934
Yesterday it worked and I am sure today it must work.

196
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,505
And this has to take place in a very smooth manner.

197
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:10,409
There are people who have read some books on Kundalini, I believe.

198
00:27:15,288 --> 00:27:18,553
First when I read them I was shocked.

199
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:27,551
They are really absolutely against what is Kundalini awakening.

200
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:35,833
They say it creates heat within you.

201
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,767
They say that it burns you.

202
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,314
Just the opposite.

203
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,209
The reason is those who are trying the Kundalini awakening

204
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,994
are not authorized people.

205
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:02,409
The one who doesn't understand about electricity

206
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:05,634
and puts his hands in the plug will get a shock.

207
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
You have to be authorized.

208
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:18,541
These people have no authority.

209
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,915
It has to be a divine authority.

210
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,049
A person who leads a life

211
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:30,694
of taking money from others in the name of God

212
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,829
is not a pure person at all.

213
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:41,637
And moreover he has no self-respect.

214
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:46,738
Or we can say he's a cheat.

215
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,611
Such a horrid person, how can he raise the Kundalini?

216
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,369
That's the purest form of energy,

217
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:02,044
for that a person has to be a pure person.

218
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:12,906
He talks to you about God and accumulates Rolls Royces.

219
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,914
It's nonsense.

220
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,369
But what happens to people I don't understand.

221
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:24,834
That they accept such situations and such people as their leaders,

222
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:27,111
who are cheats, who are fake.

223
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:39,485
It's very agonizing, to see the way people accept them.

224
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:49,969
You'll be amazed in 1970 I openly denounced all of them one by one

225
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:53,605
and told them, "Be careful about these cheats."

226
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:06,094
And I said it on a very big platform.

227
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:13,209
People were very frightened and they said, "You shouldn't have said it,

228
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,213
they will prosecute you or they will kill you".

229
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:23,246
I said, "I'll have to see a person who can kill me".

230
00:30:26,627 --> 00:30:29,919
They have no courage because they are cheats.

231
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:36,769
And they have cheated you people, you must understand this,

232
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:41,009
that you cannot have a fake person to raise your Kundalini

233
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:44,156
or to give your rebirth.

234
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:55,584
Buddha has said that ignorance is the biggest curse.

235
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:03,849
Though we have progressed very much outside, like a tree

236
00:31:03,874 --> 00:31:07,710
we are very ignorant about the roots, I think.

237
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,729
And very beautiful people, seekers are lost

238
00:31:17,754 --> 00:31:22,234
because they did not know about the roots.

239
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:33,142
In India we know the category of gurus.

240
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,209
Therein a guru who is called as Kuguru

241
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:44,274
means who is not a guru but a bad man.

242
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:54,218
And they are all out in the market, in the West.

243
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,307
Because they can't exist in India.

244
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:08,249
If they try to spread their ideas in India a farmer will say,

245
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,994
"All right, you get lost. We know all this nonsense."

246
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,455
We have had this absurd in the sixth century sometimes

247
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,534
but we have known all this, we have gone through all this.

248
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:36,353
Now, one has to realize that you have to become your own master.

249
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:47,065
That is the sign of reality.

250
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:55,529
So they say that there are gurus which are just called gurus

251
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:59,569
but they are agurus, mean they are not gurus but they do the job

252
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:03,449
like priests and all these people are not gurus but they do the job

253
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,424
you see they are paid for it.

254
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:16,467
But the sat guru is the one that makes you meet the Divine.

255
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:25,409
That's the thing. So now what happens if your Kundalini is awakened.

256
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:29,740
What happens when you get your realization, what should happen?

257
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:40,169
When the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost what happened?

258
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:42,994
they felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

259
00:33:49,745 --> 00:33:54,769
They started the language, speaking the language of centers, chakras.

260
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:58,908
And people thought they're speaking some Latin or Greek.

261
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:10,909
If you become divine person you don't speak human languages do you?

262
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:17,885
Then you speak divine language.

263
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:27,504
And the divine language is the language of the chakras, the centers.

264
00:34:34,548 --> 00:34:38,267
The people thought they were mad.

265
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:45,534
I mean if you go in the madhouse everybody thinks you are mad, isn't it.

266
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,643
No use talking to the blind people about the colors.

267
00:34:56,002 --> 00:35:00,886
But here now we are to prove of the existence of God.

268
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:08,034
And existence of this divine power.

269
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:13,459
Existence of the divine laws.

270
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:17,804
On your fingertips.

271
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:25,252
The time has come, the blossom time has come

272
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:28,729
so thousands have to become the fruit.

273
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,249
The other day another gentleman just raised

274
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:39,969
a question for nothing at all.

275
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,554
That it is called as a serpent power.

276
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:45,234
I mean I never called it, but somebody must have called it.

277
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:54,994
Because I think in the West people are very allergic to the word serpent.

278
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:07,006
But this energy is coiled into three and a half coils.

279
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:12,769
And in some people you can even see the pulsation,

280
00:36:12,794 --> 00:36:16,393
just like a heart on the triangular bone.

281
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:27,109
When there is obstruction in the stomach on the solar plexus

282
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:36,981
but it rises

283
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,675
it pierces through your fontanel bone area.

284
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,077
And you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

285
00:36:54,698 --> 00:37:00,133
It's an experience which is just the beginning.

286
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:06,144
Then you have to feel your own centers on your fingertips.

287
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:14,178
This is the actualization of baptism.

288
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:23,529
It's not something artificial, that you put some water

289
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:26,580
on somebody's head and now you are baptized.

290
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:35,348
And we accept it. We accept all these certificates we accept.

291
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:47,547
William Blake writes, "A priest cursed me on my head",

292
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,772
because he was a realized soul.

293
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,489
We had so many realized souls but they could not

294
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:07,394
convince people about it.

295
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,803
At the most they were called as mad people.

296
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:19,263
Nobody tried to understand.

297
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:26,228
Doesn't matter. Now when we will know the truth,

298
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:30,114
that we are the Spirit, that we are in charge.

299
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:33,994
Then you will see for yourself that

300
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:37,492
whatever all these great incarnations have said,

301
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:41,659
all these prophets have said is the truth.

302
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:55,430
We may say that is the knowledge of the roots.

303
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,329
To know the knowledge of the roots we have to be

304
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,714
at a subtler situation.

305
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,485
We have to become a subtler personality.

306
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:17,409
And when we become that subtler personality

307
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:23,397
we know that we are collectively conscious.

308
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:33,006
Truth must be experienced, one thing.

309
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:40,793
And everybody must say that that is so.

310
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:47,128
Like say you can say that I am wearing a red shawl all right.

311
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:54,889
Everybody sees it's a red shawl.

312
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:59,142
It is not that for some people it is green.

313
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:05,474
In the same way truth should be universal.

314
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,090
And truth should be expressed on our central nervous system.

315
00:40:18,827 --> 00:40:23,899
Like for a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

316
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:30,634
Dog. For a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

317
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:38,656
He cannot smell the filth.

318
00:40:41,991 --> 00:40:44,777
But he can feel a thief.

319
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:52,873
But for a human being it is difficult to go through a dirty lane.

320
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,418
But he can trust a thief.

321
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:07,234
So the central nervous system is the one that tells you the truth.

322
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:15,049
Our central nervous system as it is at the human level

323
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:25,082
has to be enlightened by the Spirit.

324
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:33,639
Lots of confusions there are already, I find, about the Spirit.

325
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:40,274
Language problem.

326
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:45,133
Like the Spirit could be dead body which is haunting

327
00:41:49,812 --> 00:41:54,394
or could be the Spirit, the Atma the reflection of God almighty.

328
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,127
Or could be alcohol.

329
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,689
Now which one I am talking about.

330
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:05,231
It's the Spirit in your heart.

331
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:11,741
Same about eternal life, there's a confusion I think.

332
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:21,289
Some people think that if you die and become a ghost or a vampire,

333
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:23,274
you have an eternal life.

334
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:29,249
It is not.

335
00:42:29,274 --> 00:42:35,825
Eternal life is a life where you become the Spirit which is eternal.

336
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:46,369
I must confess in this short time is not easy to explain everything

337
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:49,306
about this ocean of knowledge.

338
00:42:57,438 --> 00:43:00,049
I must have given thousands of lectures before

339
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:06,387
so I would apologize for not explaining everything

340
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:14,601
but need not explain at all

341
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:21,354
As I said that you have to just switch the button on and you get it.

342
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:27,568
So why not have it.

343
00:43:27,594 --> 00:43:29,754
May God bless you.
