1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,919
SY: Collectivity is the essence of this change,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,807
this particular time now.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,454
I mentioned before that, that in the past,

4
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:13,920
how Realization has been gained individually.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,193
Now, this time around,

6
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,482
is the possibility of it being gained collectively,

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:23,267
through the grace of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

8
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,029
Do you want me to talk anymore, Mother?

9
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:48,614
- Should I talk anymore?
SM: Yes, please. It's all right.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,799
SY: I shall talk a little more.

11
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,896
What was I talking about?

12
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:01,736
SY: Come in, sit. Oh yes, I was making a point that,

13
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,358
that in the past

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,257
it has always been a very individual,

15
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,278
gaining your Self-Realization has always been

16
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,276
a very individual exercise.

17
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,510
One person would gain,

18
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,750
one person who would work very hard usually.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,920
But now, they're saying because we have this particular age,

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,182
because we are knocking on the door of the age of Aquarius,

21
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:31,982
because we are leaving - thank God -

22
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:36,284
the age of confusion and false teaching behind us,

23
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,397
now this could happen collectively,

24
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,759
en masse.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,080
There is the possibility of gaining Self Realization,

26
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:52,431
gaining this experience, gaining this happening,

27
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,873
many people - one time gaining.

28
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,779
So again, coming back to the point I made earlier,

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,097
there are two things: one, the desire to gain one Self-Realization

30
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:08,152
and then, a second desire,

31
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:11,362
which is the desire to establish it and develop it.

32
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,940
And I'm sure Shri Mataji will be talking tonight

33
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,114
about both those things.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,880
Sahaja Yoga is basically those sort of techniques and practices

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,040
whereby we have the opportunity

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,131
to develop, to establish and develop our Realization.

37
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:33,266
What does that mean? I mean, why, why? What? Why? So what?

38
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:37,239
So why should we be interested in developing now

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,141
our Self-Realization once we've gained it? Well,

40
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:44,987
again, it's related to the times in which we live.

41
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:49,319
Pretty well everybody here tonight would have worked quite a bit

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,896
over the last few lifetimes,

43
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:54,978
to reach this point, now.

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,454
Most of us here would have gone through all sorts of things,

45
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:02,519
would have gone through the desire for money, for power,

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,880
for physical gratification, for all sorts of things,

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,707
in the hope of finding happiness and peace and understanding.

48
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:12,474
We've come to the conclusion that we haven't got,

49
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:14,625
we haven't got there.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,158
And having discarded all that, we reach the point where,

51
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,840
" Right, what is it that satisfies?"

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,920
What is it that can give us

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
that peace, that understanding?

54
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,720
Well what is it? It is the connection with the Divine.

55
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:37,039
The physical connection with the Divine.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,537
It's the only thing that could give us peace, joy

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,618
and the other by-products it can give us like health

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,743
and other silly things like finding a parking spot if you like.

59
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,240
It might sound silly but in a way it's not.

60
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,439
It's like, if one is about God's business

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
and the energy of God is flowing through us,

62
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:05,607
then why shouldn't God find us a parking spot when we need it?

63
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:08,744
One of those things that happen.

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,929
So here we are, at a very particular time,

65
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,284
very particular age,

66
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:17,449
sitting in front of a very particular person,

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,000
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,399
SM: Hello,

69
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:31,290
Brian, I don't know what you have said it. Just tell.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Can you come?

71
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,361
What did you tell them?

72
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,511
SY: Oh, I just talked, I talked little about the  three...

73
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,524
SM: Chakras.
SY: The three gunas...

74
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:45,531
and very little about the chakras, nothing very much at all.

75
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:50,376
And basically I worked

76
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:54,047
I summed up - really you heard more or less what I said before.

77
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,650
SM: All right.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,087
We are all seekers of truth,

80
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:26,105
from the very beginning.

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,814
We believe

82
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:35,949
that we'll get joy and happiness

83
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:41,244
through various means and various paths we trot.

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,371
For example, some people believe

85
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:49,490
that they must have lots of money.

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Some believe they must be in power.

87
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,214
It goes on like that,

88
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,786
till you reach a point where you find out

89
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:07,085
that those who have been running towards all these goals

90
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,695
are not happy people.

91
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:13,976
They have not achieved what they have been seeking.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
So we turn to God.

93
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,040
When we turn to God also,

94
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,702
there sometimes we get very much disillusioned

95
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:30,503
because those people who are talking about God

96
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,582
are also either money-oriented

97
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,039
or power-oriented.

98
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,640
They are not happy people.

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
That makes us very frustrated sometimes,

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,360
but the search is going on within ourselves,

101
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,240
consciously or unconsciously.

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
We are trying to seek the truth,

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,074
and this seeking is given to us by God himself.

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,760
We want to seek, all the time

105
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,600
something that is pleasurable,

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,441
that is happiness, that is joy.

107
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:15,485
Now here as he has told you,

108
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:20,640
this is the machinery that works out our Self-realisation.

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,574
So, whatever I am going to tell you

110
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,416
is the knowledge of the roots.

111
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:31,281
Through science and through other knowledge,

112
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,083
the human knowledge,

113
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,408
we know about the tree.

114
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:40,909
But we have to become subtler beings to know about our roots.

115
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,465
This knowledge was known in our country, long time back,

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,517
not that I have started anything new.

117
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:55,511
Only thing, I have been able to devise a method

118
00:07:55,712 --> 00:08:01,877
by which many people can get Realization at the same time.

119
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,600
The old methods were to cleanse yourself,

120
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,920
to go into all kinds of cleansing and

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,756
chakras by centre by centres to evolve a personality

122
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:19,066
and it would take many years,

123
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,574
 maybe many lives.

124
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,236
But in those days,

125
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:27,188
when we are in such a chaos,

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
and all the time we are facing a challenge

127
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:37,226
it is important that it should happen the other way around.

128
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,160
The other way around is like this,

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,959
that first you get your Realization, somehow.

130
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,440
You may not be clean, there may be problem,

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,502
there may be physical problem

132
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:51,680
there may be other problems within you - doesn't matter.

133
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,247
You get your Realization,

134
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,302
means you get the light in your hand.

135
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,640
Once you get the light in your hand,

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,680
you can yourself see what's wrong with you.

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,040
Say, I am holding a snake in my hand

138
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,159
and somebody says, "You are holding a snake, so throw it away."

139
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,880
So I wouldn't like it, somebody challenging my ego

140
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,960
that as if I don't know what is a snake.

141
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,736
In the dark, I cannot see the snake.

142
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:20,376
But if there is light, I'll throw it away immediately.

143
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:24,529
That is the principle on which Sahaja Yoga works out.

144
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,723
Sahaja means, "sa" means "with" and "ja" is "born with you"

145
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,120
means a spontaneous happening

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,284
of your union, of your attention, with the Divine,

147
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:38,270
the all-pervading Power of God's love.

148
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:45,446
This All-pervading Power has got vibratory awareness in it.

149
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,479
And it gives you also that vibratory awareness,

150
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,537
once you are connected with it.

151
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,098
Not only that, but this vibratory awareness

152
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:58,599
starts flowing through your fingertips, here,

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,830
and you can feel what is wrong with you

154
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,159
or what is wrong with others.

155
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,400
Is a very simple method of deducting

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,480
how to correct yourself in the light of the Spirit.

157
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,160
When you become one with the Spirit

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,880
this vibratory awareness starts flowing through your hands

159
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,960
and through your fontanele bone area.

160
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,280
This is what Christ called as the baptism.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,240
This is the real baptism. it's a happening,

162
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
it's a living process. He has talked of the living God

163
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,560
and the living process, not of the dead - just comes somebody

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,858
and put water on your head and say that "You are baptised."

165
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,960
In the same way, hindus have a custom

166
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,675
of giving Realization in a way

167
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:49,777
that they call it, is a ritual

168
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:53,406
in which they say, "Now you have become a brahmin."

169
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:57,743
By paying some money to some priest,

170
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:01,359
they think now he has become a brahmin, now he is certified.

171
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
This is all artificial, this is not real.

172
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,179
In every religion they have taken this as a ritual.

173
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,560
To form a ritual by that artificial ritual

174
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:16,881
they think they can certify that you are a realised soul

175
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,601
or you are a "pir" in the islamic religion

176
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:25,246
or you are a Christian in a Christian religion

177
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,978
or in any religion like that.

178
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:32,167
To be honest, these are all artificial methods.

179
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,452
Real method is, that this triangular bone

180
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:40,920
which has got this Kundalini as in itself - is the force,

181
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,320
has to rise actually just like a primule in a seed.

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,250
It's a living process,

183
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:49,934
like a seed when you put it in the Mother Earth

184
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,760
the primule of that seed just rises.

185
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,160
and comes upward, by itself.

186
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,880
It comes upward and creates the plant.

187
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
It is not that you pull out the primule

188
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,399
and say that, "This is the plant"

189
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,288
or you just bless the seed

190
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:09,471
and say, "Now the plant has been created."

191
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a living process.

192
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,468
Now we have reached at a stage,

193
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:16,200
where we call ourselves as human beings

194
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,960
and you know very well that our central nervous system

195
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
has achieved lots of sensitivities

196
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,720
which the animals don't have.

197
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,360
Like, they don't understand beauty,

198
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,120
animals don't understand dirt, filth.

199
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,524
You can take an animal through dirt and filth

200
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:41,880
and you cannot take a human being through that.

201
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,520
Because a human being can understand

202
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,343
but a dog or a horse cannot understand that this is dirty or filthy.

203
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:56,240
What happens really is that human beings

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,280
have developed within themselves the sensitivity

205
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,391
to beauty or to the filth,

206
00:13:02,592 --> 00:13:03,858
automatically.

207
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,090
What have you done? Have you paid for it?

208
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,757
Have you read something?

209
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,092
Nothing of the kind.

210
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:12,058
Automatically, spontaneously, it has evolved within us

211
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,895
these powers of sensitivity.

212
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,920
Now, the powers of sensitivity are there,

213
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,940
but still we are not at the absolute point

214
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:25,960
which we can see the way there is chaos all around us.

215
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,881
People are in a chaotic conditions,

216
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:30,924
now you see there are diseases coming up,

217
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,688
you can't explain how they come up,

218
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,295
people are doing wrong things

219
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:36,755
without understanding this is wrong or right.

220
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,297
All kinds of things are happening in this world,

221
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:43,920
with all difficulties, with all problems

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,301
and we do not know what is the solution of it

223
00:13:46,502 --> 00:13:48,280
and why these are happening.

224
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,600
After all, if we are the epitome of our evolution,

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,160
if we are the top people in the evolution,

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,658
why should there be problems, why should there be any struggles,

227
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,363
why there should be any diseases?

228
00:14:01,564 --> 00:14:03,480
But we are not.

229
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,799
We have to still, jump one stage higher,

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,640
and that is the stage which we call as the Spirit.

231
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:17,079
Every one of them who are great saints,

232
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,818
or who, we can say, are incarnations,

233
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,617
prophets, have talked about this,

234
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:26,280
that you have to be connected with God.

235
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,330
Even in the Quran,

236
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:32,920
in the beginning it is said that you are to be connected with God.

237
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Otherwise, you can never understand Him,

238
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,925
and if you do anything in His name,

239
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:41,485
it will be all wrong, cruel or horrible.

240
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,720
Very clearly said.

241
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,880
Also there is something good Quran has written,

242
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,440
that when the time of resurrection will come -

243
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
that is also described in the Bible -

244
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,419
your hands will speak.

245
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,799
Now, hands cannot speak.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,442
But the sensitivity of the hands and the fingers

247
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,431
will become such, that through your fingertips

248
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:09,680
you will be able to diagnose

249
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,039
the problems of other people and yourself,

250
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,880
and if you know how to correct them, you can do it.

251
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,069
Now this is a living process,

252
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,960
any living process - a sort of a flower becoming a fruit.

253
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
You can see very clearly a flower becoming a fruit

254
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,480
is a living process.

255
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,880
You cannot pay to the tree or to the Mother Earth,

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,084
"All right, we pay you so much money. Now you give us fruits".

257
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,480
Money is not understood by living processes.

258
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:49,408
I mean supposing somebody is having a breathing trouble

259
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:52,111
and you show him some money, will he stop breathing trouble?

260
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:55,520
Will he be able to stop? No! It's a living process.

261
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,800
Again I say, it's a living process.

262
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,540
And when it is a living process, you cannot pay for it,

263
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:05,986
nor can you put in any effort for it.

264
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,679
It is effortless.

265
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,543
Sahaj also means effortless.

266
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,640
Spontaneous, effortlessly it should work out.

267
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,649
You don't have to put in effort like standing on your head

268
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,320
or going to Himalayas. There's no need to do all that.

269
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,600
There's no need to fast,

270
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,351
there's no need to torture your body in any way.

271
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,960
I cannot understand why people believe

272
00:16:32,161 --> 00:16:34,173
that we should torture our body

273
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:36,599
so that we can become divine.

274
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,355
Is a wrong idea altogether.

275
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,560
Because it is said - at least for Christians I can't understand.

276
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,840
Krishna, at the time of Krishna also, He didn't say so,

277
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,368
but then Christ came after that.

278
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,280
You see, Krishna is manifested by Christ later on.

279
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,920
Everybody has manifested at different levels -

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,618
like in a tree, you find at different times, something appears.

281
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,000
They are the flowers on the same tree of life.

282
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,385
There's no difference between them at all.

283
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:10,573
But when you pluck the flowers and
say, "This is mine, this is mine" -

284
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:13,490
with the dead flowers you can fight.

285
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,920
This is exactly what has happened today,

286
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,040
that's why they cannot relate them to each other.

287
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,960
But Christ Himself has said,

288
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,960
that, "Those who are not against Me are with Me".

289
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,120
Who are with Him?

290
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,000
He didn't have much time to talk to people.

291
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,800
He had only three and a half years public life,

292
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,690
and then he was crucified on a foolish thing

293
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,760
like saying that he is a traitor and all kinds of things.

294
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,859
He had no chance even to tell people

295
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,398
about something subtler.

296
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,800
And this is something one should understand,

297
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,710
that in London I was struggling

298
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,882
with seven, seven people for four years.

299
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,254
Of course now it's different. Now I don't have to do that,

300
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:06,475
because once you have established the foundation, the things are better.

301
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:08,440
But it was so.

302
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,740
So imagine for three and a half years,

303
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,984
what could Christ tell about things?

304
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:16,820
Whatever he has said is also very much clearly understood

305
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:19,453
when you are a realised soul.

306
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,423
If you are not a realized soul, you cannot even understand Him.

307
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:28,411
Because He said that, "My God has asked Me to do this.

308
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,044
My Father has asked Me".

309
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,222
And He got Himself crucified

310
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:34,450
and we say that He died for our sins.

311
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:36,694
So now, why should we suffer more?

312
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:39,476
He carried the cross. What is the need for us to suffer?

313
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:43,080
Are we going to suffer more than He has suffered?

314
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,344
Is anybody can carry,

315
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:52,651
 is anyone of those who say that, "We must suffer" -

316
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,512
let them carry a cross for a while

317
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,719
and we'll see how much they can suffer.

318
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,859
Is an absolutely wrong idea.

319
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,121
God doesn't want you to suffer at all.

320
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:04,502
No, He doesn't want. He loves you, He's the most loving Father.

321
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:06,352
He doesn't want to suffer you.

322
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:10,000
He loves you and He will do everything that is possible

323
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,120
for you to enter into the Kingdom of God.

324
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,280
So at this time, when we are faced with such difficulties -

325
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,725
people are telling Me that, "Now we are waiting

326
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:25,400
for all the seven stars to come in and the whole world to collapse".

327
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,441
Because they don't want to live anymore.

328
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,239
This is the condition, this frustration that we are into,

329
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
but I tell you, there's nothing to worry about.

330
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,509
Whatever may be your situation,

331
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,618
whatever may you have suffered with,

332
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,942
whatever maybe your social problems

333
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,117
or your physical problems,

334
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:50,900
or your family problems, financial problems,

335
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:54,240
all can be solved with one shot,

336
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,120
because there's the Mother Kundalini sitting there.

337
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,360
And when She rises She passes through the six centres,

338
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,039
which represent different, different capacities in you,

339
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,421
enlightens them

340
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,959
and She grants you all these things that I have said.

341
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,840
But apart from that, you get connected with the All-pervading power

342
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,680
and you develop a collective consciousness within you,

343
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,680
collective consciousness.

344
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,839
It's not just saying, "We are brothers and sisters".

345
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,263
You just start feeling another person

346
00:20:27,464 --> 00:20:30,443
on your fingertips and you love that person.

347
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,305
And also you start feeling yourself on your fingertips.

348
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:42,160
This is the greatest discovery in the whole world, I should say,

349
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:45,720
that people can get their Self-Realization.

350
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,120
All other discoveries can complicate things,

351
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
can give problems, can be disputed,

352
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,502
but, this theory cannot,

353
00:20:55,703 --> 00:21:00,680
because this makes you a person with absolute values.

354
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,599
One doesn't have to tell, "Now you be righteous",

355
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,759
I've seen drug addicts giving up drugs overnight,

356
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,454
alcoholics giving up alcohols overnight.

357
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,669
Even Brian was telling Me the other day

358
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,840
he used to smoke eighty cigarettes

359
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,413
and then from next day he just stopped.

360
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:19,056
I didn't know, but he told Me.

361
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:22,243
He was in crutches when he came to Me.

362
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,960
So I have seen things happening like that, and it works out.

363
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,783
But for you it is better that you get your Self-Realization

364
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:33,733
and you know about it what it is.

365
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,960
Actually to get Self-Realization

366
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,950
you don't have to know all these things.

367
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:41,160
It is something like, to switch on the lights,

368
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,318
you just have to know where the switch is.

369
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,960
You don't have to know about the electricity,

370
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,049
about the organisation behind it, about the history behind it.

371
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,840
Just this much - where is the switch.

372
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,680
In the same way, for your Realization,

373
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,376
you have to be switched on, that's all.

374
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,482
But then, later on you should know,

375
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,530
what is the mechanism that is worked out

376
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,033
because if you want to give Realisation to others

377
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,996
if you want to help others, then you must know about it.

378
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,640
The peace - we talk about we should have peace,

379
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,480
we should have no atomic energy,

380
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,790
we should have not this problem, that problem.

381
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:21,400
Everybody is suffering from sense of insecurity from each other.

382
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,703
Russia is afraid of America, America is afraid of Russia,

383
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:26,919
everybody is afraid of each other.

384
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,188
We are human beings. Even animals are not so much afraid,

385
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:33,400
as we are afraid of our brothers and sisters.

386
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,260
Why should we be so much afraid?

387
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,268
Because we have not reached that stage

388
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,774
where we are collective, we are one,

389
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:43,560
where we feel that we are the part and parcel of the whole.

390
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,720
As you say, the microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm.

391
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,520
The microcosm starts feeling the whole.

392
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,760
One drop becomes the ocean. That's what has to happen.

393
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,522
And when that happens,

394
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:03,240
all your theories become absolutely actualised.

395
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
Like the other day somebody said, "Mother,

396
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,720
are you a capitalist or a communist?"

397
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,520
I said, "I am both". "How?"

398
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,840
I said, "I am a capitalist because I have powers,

399
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,601
and I am a communist because I must distribute them

400
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,123
and share them with others.

401
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:22,511
So I am a communist as well as a capitalist,

402
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:26,040
both things together". Is so simple as that.

403
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,560
So you get completely integrated

404
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,120
and all these false notions and theories drop out.

405
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,776
These are all dogmas which are artificial,

406
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,720
but basically a human being

407
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,850
is the most beautiful thing God has created.

408
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,344
The most beautiful thing God has created is the human being.

409
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:46,000
We have not known the beauty of human beings.

410
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,560
We can only know through the eyes of the Spirit.

411
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,636
When you become the Spirit,

412
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:57,440
then you start enjoying the beauty of another person.

413
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,560
Whatever may be the race, religion -

414
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,687
all these things do not come into your mind.

415
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,760
From outside you cannot remove all these things.

416
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,800
You cannot remove the differentiations between human beings,

417
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,585
you cannot. By logic you cannot.

418
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:15,800
But by becoming realised you automatically do it.

419
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,699
You just don't see any difference,

420
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,378
because where you go is the subtle form of yourself,

421
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,177
which is the Kundalini.

422
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,640
You just see a person in his chakras and not in his face,

423
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,040
in his dress, in his status or in his money.

424
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:34,959
Now also, there were questions raised the other day

425
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,909
about so many false people

426
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:41,480
have been preaching about yoga, this, that and all that.

427
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,640
How to make out a false person from the real one.

428
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:48,520
The first criteria should to be, "Does he take any money from you?".

429
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,200
Finished. On that point you can cancel most of them.

430
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:54,919
But there are so many institutions which take money

431
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,017
in the name of God and run them.

432
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,727
This is also very wrong. You should not.

433
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,869
If you want to run an institution, in the name of God,

434
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,991
you need not take any money from anyone.

435
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:07,901
What you can do is to, whatever it is -

436
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,408
like Me now, we have no organisation,

437
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:14,199
no membership, nothing of the kind.

438
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,059
We are so much attached to each other,

439
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,883
that we are not bothered about

440
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:21,388
taking money for a combination or anything.

441
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,280
For example, if I've come here, I'm living with Brian.

442
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,760
If I go to Australia, I live with another person.

443
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,320
If they come there, they come to My house.

444
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,639
At the most, they pay for travelling - that's all.

445
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,839
And that too through a travel agent, they don't pay Me or to anyone.

446
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,560
So there is no need to have big accounting

447
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,240
and big organisations and money and all this nonsense,

448
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,080
because this money is a thing that creates problem.

449
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,188
You must have heard now, there's a...

450
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:53,349
one person is found with so much of millions of money with him

451
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,230
who was saying he is a born again.

452
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,320
This kind of born again are not - this is self certification;

453
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,560
just a self certification, "I am born again".

454
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,560
A born again has certain powers.

455
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:09,335
One power he has that he can raise the Kundalini of others

456
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,600
and give them Realisation, firstly.

457
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,435
He doesn't take any money for it,

458
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,282
he doesn't talk of money or anything.

459
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:19,110
He can raise his hand and give Realization to others.

460
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,594
He can feel the vibrations of another person

461
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:23,864
and he can tell what's wrong with that person

462
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,317
and also he can correct himself.

463
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,009
The third power he has got,

464
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,429
that sitting down here, he can tell you about anyone you want to know,

465
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,400
what are his chakras like, what are his problems.

466
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,120
Sitting down here he can say which are the people

467
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,040
who are realised soul or not,

468
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,240
which prime minister is a realised soul and which is not.

469
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,009
Sitting down here they will know,

470
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,295
because is the sublest of subtle,

471
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,549
of the ether as you can say.

472
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,120
We are all gifted with that.

473
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,040
It's all there - only thing you have to be put to the mains.

474
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,759
Like this instrument won't work till it is put to the mains.

475
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,100
In the same way, once you are put to the mains,

476
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:05,440
you start working out your fantastic qualities,

477
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,960
which are very beautiful and glorious.

478
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,000
You automatically become virtous and righteous.

479
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,320
I don't have to give a sermon for that,

480
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,083
"Don't do this and don't do that". You just won't do it.

481
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
You won't do anything that will destroy you.

482
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,560
You go on to another path of construction of yourself,

483
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,479
of your family, of your neighbours, of your city,

484
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,800
and then of your nation and the whole world at large.

485
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,800
This is what we have to do today.

486
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:43,680
All the rest of talks and these things are not going to help at all.

487
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,783
Because people, in talks say something, forget next moment.

488
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:50,362
Here you cannot forget

489
00:27:50,563 --> 00:27:53,160
because the whole thing works on your central nervous system,

490
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,160
it becomes your awareness on central nervous system.

491
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,920
You start feeling it on your central nervous system -

492
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,760
that shows that you are fully evolved.

493
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:08,040
All differences, all problems, all adherences

494
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,520
all wrong ideas of possessions just drop out.

495
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,329
You stand in your own glory.

496
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,410
You are not reactionary, you do not react to anything.

497
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:19,719
Neither you react,

498
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,080
nor you accept anything blindfolded.

499
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,800
You know what is exactly the right thing is

500
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,686
and what is right thing to be done

501
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:29,786
and you stand on that right thing,

502
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:36,349
without bothering about what is to be done for the compromise.

503
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:42,248
Like Christ, you know, that he stood against Mary Magadalene

504
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:45,352
and said, "Those who have not committed any sin

505
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,092
can throw a stone at Me".

506
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,920
That's the courage of a realised soul,

507
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,160
that he knows this is the time he has to protect her, and he stands.

508
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,478
He has nothing to do with a prostitute, a man like Him.

509
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,658
But he stands up and he says so.

510
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:05,279
That courage, that quality, that personality

511
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,000
just dawns and you are surprised at yourself,

512
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,240
"How I could do it?".

513
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,359
Apart from that, there are many dynamic gifts you get.

514
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,408
Some people become great artists.

515
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:20,025
We have in Australia only one girl -

516
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:22,839
she became a great artist, very well known now.

517
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,680
And there are some people who become very great musicians, poets -

518
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:31,401
all such qualities you can get.

519
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,068
But the best of all, that you become an innocent person.

520
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,920
You become very innocent.

521
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,136
All the so-called sins you have committed

522
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,400
drop out and you become an innocent person

523
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,320
and a very powerful person,

524
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,760
very powerful and humble,

525
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:59,957
very satisfied

526
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,955
and compassionate person - that's what you become.

527
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,439
It just happens,

528
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,516
it is because it's all within you.

529
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:11,856
It is not yet been manifested,

530
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,279
like some clouds can cover the moon,

531
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,514
but when the clouds disappear, you can see the beautiful moon -

532
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:19,125
in the same way.

533
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:22,639
You become very energetic, you can work very hard,

534
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,314
you don't feel tired at all,

535
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:29,160
because the energy is all the time flowing in you,

536
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,920
you respect whatever is to be respected very well

537
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,680
and you do not bother about things

538
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,000
which are not to be bothered about.

539
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,830
So many qualities you develop.

540
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:45,879
I Myself never expected

541
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,288
that Sahaja Yoga will work to that extent, up to New Zealand,

542
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,720
I never, never knew that it will go that far in my lifetime,

543
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,401
but it has spread so fast

544
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:58,461
and so many people have been blessed.

545
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:00,636
In Australia -

546
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:05,020
I consider Australia and New Zealand as one cell,

547
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:07,689
one place, one country, not two.

548
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,664
Is one country is in the thing

549
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:12,663
and is this red one that you see there,

550
00:31:12,864 --> 00:31:14,963
with four chakras - is the first one,

551
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:18,193
is the centre of innocence.

552
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,640
And one day will come, I am sure of it,

553
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,520
that Australia and New Zealand

554
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,976
will be the leaders in spirituality,

555
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,039
if not in anything else.

556
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,800
They have never invaded any country as such.

557
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,280
Maybe that they came here and settled down

558
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,877
but they did not invade.

559
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:40,528
So it's a very big assurance I have,

560
00:31:40,729 --> 00:31:43,872
because I have seen the way Australians

561
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:46,591
are mobilising Sahaja Yoga all over.

562
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,965
Only in Sydney we have got twelve centres.

563
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,023
When we don't take any money,

564
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:54,120
we don't have any organisation, we have no membership,

565
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,600
we have twelve centres in Sydney.

566
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,440
That's how we should do something in New Zealand also

567
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,238
and I'm sure very soon,

568
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:04,451
under the guidance of Brian, it will work out

569
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:11,427
and that you all will achieve your epitome of your evolution,

570
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,919
that is the absoluteness.

571
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,449
May God bless you all.

572
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:20,840
I'm sorry there's only one lecture.

573
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,128
I am here only for one day

574
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,790
so I cannot elaborately talk about it.

575
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,824
But there are many tapes they have

576
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:30,397
which you can hear about different, different subjects

577
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:37,011
and you can also know what is, how to do the meditation.

578
00:32:37,212 --> 00:32:39,591
The meditation is only for five minutes in the morning

579
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,496
and five minutes in the evening.

580
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:44,718
You can learn everything from them. They know

581
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,600
very well because they have been very, very senior Sahaja Yogis,

582
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,360
and are respected all over the world.

583
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,237
Only thing, in number they are less and I was telling them,

584
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,516
"If you get too many people, how will you manage?".

585
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,520
They said, "We'll manage somehow, Mother".

586
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,991
So, that's how, but you have to cooperate with them little bit

587
00:33:02,192 --> 00:33:04,199
and it can work out.

588
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,360
We'll have the session of Realization now,

589
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,656
but I would like you to ask Me questions,

590
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:15,402
but not too many, because we don't have so much time.

591
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:18,323
L: I cannot [actually realize]

592
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,426
if we are the Spirit

593
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:24,839
and if we have been in the world many, many times,

594
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,209
why we are still killing one another?

595
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,079
SM: Why are we?
SY: Why are we...

596
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,159
If we have been evolving for such a long time towards the Spirit,

597
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,394
why are we still killing each other?

598
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,800
SM: That's the trouble, I agree with you.

599
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:44,269
You see, these modern times are described in the Puranas

600
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,239
as Ghor Kali Yuga - the worst times. These are the worst time

601
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,640
when the people will become absolutely horrid.

602
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,160
Because without getting connected with God,

603
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,600
we started moving in another lines, you see.

604
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,609
Because you were not connected with God,

605
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,480
If we were connected with God, we would never have done it.

606
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,784
We have - by our many births,

607
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:09,800
what has happened is that these centres were established within us.

608
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:13,200
But how we have used this and how we have worked out,

609
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,827
I agree that it's, cannot understand why we are killing each other.

610
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:19,179
The trouble is that we are not connected with God,

611
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,430
that's why we have done all these things.

612
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:25,300
L: You say that God doesn't want us to suffer,

613
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:28,707
but there is still a lot of suffering in the world.

614
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,159
SY: You say that God does not want us to suffer

615
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,920
but there is still a lot of suffering in the world.

616
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,759
SM: Human beings have created the suffering.

617
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,600
God did not, it's the human beings.

618
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,240
They have to learn a lesson I think, by so many ways.

619
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:49,840
They just want to destroy themselves. See the things they do,

620
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,025
the things they like - it's all self-destructive.

621
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,320
All the things they try to do - human beings - are self destructive.

622
00:34:57,521 --> 00:35:00,814
You see their behavior - you can't explain why they do it so stupidly,

623
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,823
so many things which will destroy. Now supposing

624
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:08,880
you ask the bull to come and hit you, then what happens?

625
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,160
The bull will come and hit you.

626
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,600
God has given us freedom of choice.

627
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,360
In that you can go to heaven or to hell.

628
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,880
Now many people prefer to go to hell all the time -

629
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,520
this is the trouble. And you have to have your freedom,

630
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,360
because unless and until you have your freedom,

631
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,830
how can you enjoy your ultimate freedom?

632
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:33,092
You have to have.

633
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,599
G: When did you find the Realization yourself?

634
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,125
SY: The gentleman wants to know

635
00:35:43,326 --> 00:35:46,279
where did you find the Realization yourself.

636
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,080
SM: I didn't find it, I had it from my childhood, all right?

637
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,160
But now I would say that don't ask questions about Me,

638
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,262
because it is better that you get your Spirit and then know Me.

639
00:35:58,463 --> 00:36:00,167
Not easy to know Me, you see,

640
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:04,110
it's quite an illusive personality is before you.

641
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,880
SY: It is a Maori welcome, Shri Mataji.

642
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:24,002
L: Thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you [unclear]..

643
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:27,232
SM: Thank you, thank you very much.

644
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,862
Beautiful.

645
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:28,704
Do you know, we have in India

646
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,250
a clan or, you can call, a kind of people

647
00:37:34,451 --> 00:37:37,479
who are called as maoris living still in India.

648
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,679
And am I now going to go and find out about them.

649
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,520
And they come from the same province as I,

650
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,115
from the Maharashtra province.

651
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:49,482
So we are going to find out about them

652
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,830
L: I have a question.

653
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:53,985
I find and I got a spiritual teacher

654
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:56,717
and then I will be grounded and

655
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,617
for the longest time I've been three months.

656
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:06,047
I don't need to meditate, I don't need to do ritual.

657
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:08,168
I just always am

658
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,653
but I find that I get uncentered

659
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:16,009
and what I like is that it always be that way and always

660
00:38:16,288 --> 00:38:20,748
without having to work at it or happen to go get it fixed.

661
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,938
I don't get my meditation, my guru fixed.

662
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:26,811
]

663
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,240
SY: She's saying that she goes to a guru or spiritual teacher

664
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,880
and can find a balance perhaps for three months,

665
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,720
but then it doesn't last and says she has to find a,

666
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,760
another injection or fix and she has a strong desire

667
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,031
that she should gain

668
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:52,751
this experience, this quality, this feeling

669
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,845
all the time, she wants it all the time.

670
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,960
SM: Yes, yes, you can always have it all the time, no doubt.

671
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,840
But you see, when you go to a guru or anyone,

672
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,133
it's like a guru shopping.

673
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:06,599
And I'm not a guru.

674
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,439
I'll make you your own guru, all right?

675
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,071
And you will know why you lose vibrations.

676
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:14,712
It's not question of balance,

677
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:16,961
it's not question of just feeling better.

678
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,520
You can feel better with some drinks also.

679
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,560
It's not that. It's something that you become empowered with,

680
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,240
something which you understand yourself,

681
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,480
something that you understand other people.

682
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,675
It's not just merely just feeling better for a while,

683
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:35,160
that's not the point.

684
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,705
You will become your own, own guru.

685
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:43,160
You will know yourself where you are going wrong.

686
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:46,920
SY: Anybody else?

687
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,560
The lady is asking about different energies

688
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,876
that can come into you and some of them are not very nice ones.

689
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:26,924
SY: I think she is talking about entities also.

690
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:29,495
SY: Oh, entities?

691
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,760
SM: That's what it is, because it's not divine energies.

692
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,659
These are negative energies.

693
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,224
They can all come into you

694
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,919
but if you become divine, they run away.

695
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,320
That's why you have to be...  yes, correct, entities is a good,

696
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,800
you have seen - it's a good thing.

697
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,480
Because even to talk about them is sometimes difficult,

698
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,600
but there are, all these negative forces are there,

699
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,211
that's why we do wrong.

700
00:40:58,426 --> 00:41:00,319
But that we accept much easily.

701
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,400
Because we have risen from matter, we go to matter very easily

702
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,520
and we take those dead energies much more faster

703
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,053
than the real energy.

704
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:12,359
But once you are a realized soul,

705
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,040
then you are not affected by them.

706
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:21,588
L: Mother, why is there so much ignorance in the world?

707
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,401
I mean, in myself, too.

708
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:28,279
When I look at that I realize now...

709
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,616
I was a Catholic for fourty years,

710
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,039
and now I realise that

711
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,840
religion has never brought peace to the world.

712
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,520
SM: It's correct.

713
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,440
See, you are all very simple people, naive people,

714
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,167
L: Good people.

715
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:46,919
SM: Good people. of course.

716
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,079
Now, there are set of very good people, many people, good people.

717
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,560
There are set of some evil people -

718
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:57,375
they sit down and plan out.

719
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,880
Like every religious book is being changed.

720
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,240
Now, I can say about our Bible, you should see clearly.

721
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,560
Kahlil Gibran has said the same thing,

722
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,680
that, "Why mister Paul is there, in the Bible?"

723
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,960
He's the one who transformed Bible into many things.

724
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,960
There is everywhere. In Gita it is written

725
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,800
that you are born with your caste.

726
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:25,600
Cannot be. Because the one who has written, Vyasa,

727
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,760
was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

728
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,920
So there cannot be any caste like that.

729
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,880
How can he say you are born as a brahmin?

730
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,840
He cannot say, because he was not himself born as a brahmin.

731
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,735
But, you see, what happens,

732
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:42,932
simple people start believing in all these things

733
00:42:43,133 --> 00:42:47,119
and start getting to them and misleading. They are very misleading,

734
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,039
they have organisations, they do all kinds of things,

735
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,840
and they threaten you all the time, "If you don't do this,

736
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,720
you'll go to hell, this will happen, that will happen."

737
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,314
And simple people just get frightened, you know,

738
00:42:58,515 --> 00:43:00,560
that, "Oh God, we'll go to hell now".

739
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,200
So they just say "All right, whatever you say we'll do".

740
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,216
Whatever they say they do it.

741
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:07,674
In this, so many things like that,

742
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,886
these gurus also taking full advantage, you see

743
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,760
they make a big ado, "Now, come along,

744
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,540
we'll give you a, sort of a diksha, as they call it,

745
00:43:17,741 --> 00:43:19,167
it is enunciation.

746
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:21,528
For that you have to go this way, that way,

747
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,453
make a big drama out of it, befoul the people.

748
00:43:24,654 --> 00:43:26,480
Befouling is so much.

749
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,880
Now, this TM is another befouling, very big befouling

750
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:36,225
and gives you horrible things like epilepsy, horrible diseases.

751
00:43:36,426 --> 00:43:39,535
And some of the patients have come to me of AIDS from there -

752
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:40,792
 it's surprising.

753
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,864
But still people are going to it, I'm warning them openly,

754
00:43:44,065 --> 00:43:46,880
but I don't think they listen to Me.

755
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:52,359
Now, this, she said the energies, you see,

756
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,840
they put these black energies upon people and also entice them

757
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,760
and also try to mesmerize them.

758
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,560
They are not aware of what they are doing, stupidly.

759
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,014
This is the thing is,

760
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:08,707
because they are so simple, such good people.

761
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:13,360
Say, when it's a white sari is very easy to spoil it, isn't it?

762
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,200
But if it's a black one, it may not be spoiled so easily.

763
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,520
That's what you are, simple people, simple hearted, good people.

764
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,240
Easily you catch on to these things.

765
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,280
Like in TM, they give mantras,

766
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,640
with such, three hundred pounds you have to pay.

767
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,400
And she was saying is 900 dollars -

768
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,000
you have to pay just to get a mantra.

769
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,680
And the mantra is what? Is "inga".

770
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,280
"inga" means the tail of a scorpion.

771
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,872
Just imagine!

772
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:51,079
There is nothing like "inga" in Sanskrit language.

773
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,680
That's not there, this word is not there.

774
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,120
Then they have to... he says that, "tinga".

775
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,734
Tinga means showing it down like that - tinga.

776
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,702
All such stupid words they have given,

777
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:08,680
taking three hundred pounds from them - only for giving the words.

778
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,002
So what to do? Why people believe them?

779
00:45:13,203 --> 00:45:15,089
Is because they have big organisations,

780
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,890
they have big buildings, big houses

781
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:22,664
and they are very inviting and they do all kinds of things.

782
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,438
M: Did you practice your Kundalini through an experience in your life?

783
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:31,823
SY: Have you practiced?

784
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,521
Experienced Kundalini movement? Kundalini?

785
00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:37,952
SM: Yes, I will just now. I'll move yours just now.

786
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:40,525
M: Suppose somebody practice the Kundalini

787
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:44,290
and moves the halfway, what happens to him? Who will be controlling?

788
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,210
SM: No, no, no, it is all wrong idea

789
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,035
because people who had no authority

790
00:45:50,236 --> 00:45:53,753
to put their hands to Kundalini have tried it - that's why.

791
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,948
They have no business, they have no character,

792
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:57,631
they have no authority from God.

793
00:45:57,832 --> 00:45:59,806
I have done this for thousands of people.

794
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,440
Nobody has suffered, everybody has got it.

795
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,480
Nothing happens, nothing goes wrong.

796
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:07,625
It's not like that.

797
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:11,121
B: Some people are liable to get...
SM: No one.

798
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:12,948
SM: No one, no one.

799
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:14,837
B: And do you think anybody can do...

800
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:16,789
SM: That's your Mother, Sir.

801
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,700
Now, a mother, when you were born

802
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:25,269
took all your troubles of your birth upon herself.

803
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,229
She didn't trouble you, did she?

804
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,199
She's your individual Mother, how can She trouble you?

805
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,422
This is all a myth and I think it's negative again,

806
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:37,532
because they must have tried to frighten you

807
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,362
that you don't get your Realization.

808
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,079
That might be one of the reasons.

809
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,560
Also I have seen books written - these people,

810
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,920
they have such bad vibrations - the one who have written the books.

811
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,193
L: I want to ask You the question about spiritual places in the earth

812
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,880
that are more powerful,

813
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:01,152
the earth is more powerful, spiritual places which will help you

814
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:04,159
become realized more faster or [does it matter still]?

815
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,936
SY: Oh it's an interesting question.

816
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:09,640
Are there places on earth which are more powerful,

817
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:13,280
which will help you to get your Realization more quickly?

818
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,919
Are there places of special qualities, special spiritual qualities?

819
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,722
Shri Mataji: I don't know any.

820
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,360
I can't mislead you, My child.

821
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,520
SY: Swayambus?

822
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,091
SM: You mean to, some places from the Mother Earth?

823
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:31,342
L: No, no...

824
00:47:31,703 --> 00:47:37,441
Some [unclear] around the world evidently, [unclear].

825
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,960
SM: Some organisations?

826
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:46,040
Ah yes, yes, that kind there, that's true, that is all right.

827
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,600
I thought you are saying some organisations.

828
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,080
Of course, the Mother Earth has created so many points like that.

829
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,080
She has made so many points

830
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,800
which do emit vibrations, no doubt about it. She has.

831
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:03,521
L: When the Kundalini has been awakened,

832
00:48:04,285 --> 00:48:06,771
anything blocks it on,

833
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:08,493
or makes it stop?

834
00:48:08,694 --> 00:48:10,877
Once the Kundalini has been...

835
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:13,178
SM: Raised, yes.

836
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,119
L: Can it be stoped or blocked?

837
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,258
SM: It does sometimes get blocked, not doubt about it

838
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:20,880
but we can clear it - it's not so difficult.

839
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,720
We can clear it - it's not so difficult to clear it.

840
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,120
There's nothing to worry about.

841
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,160
You can yourself clear it, anybody can clear it.

842
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,120
No problem, it's a simple thing.

843
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,760
B: You've made a statement earlier this evening

844
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,640
that this is the age of Aquarius.

845
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,520
This is the first time that I've heard

846
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,800
it said in a very simple way.

847
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,027
However, it was indicated

848
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,599
that the middle of the next century

849
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,160
is the limitation of the achievement.

850
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,635
The question I would like to ask is:

851
00:49:01,842 --> 00:49:03,559
as far as I'm concerned,

852
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,200
I'll probably won't see the middle of the next century.

853
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,240
I'm not asking you to be,

854
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:19,019
what should I say, a fortune teller in that context,

855
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:22,931
but rather what I would like to know is,

856
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:24,906
if I can't see it,

857
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:29,853
is there anything that you are able to indicate

858
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:34,840
as to what is going to happen after the middle of the next century?

859
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,240
SY: He draws attention to the fact that the age of Aquarius

860
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:43,480
is really at a sort of climax,

861
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,640
is really moving in the middle of next century.

862
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,960
SM: This is... Aquarius is Kundalini, Aquarius is the kumba, you see

863
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,964
is the kumba, is the... Aquarius,

864
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,207
in Sanskrit language is kumba,

865
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,680
and in your language is the water carrier.

866
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,280
Isn't it? It's a translated term.

867
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,280
That is the triangular bone within us.

868
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:06,640
And this is the age of Aquarius, no doubt about.

869
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,920
No doubt, this is the age of Kundalini, is the Aquarius, is true.

870
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,800
In sanskrit is it called as kumba, kumba is the...

871
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,920
in the kumba the Kundalini is placed there, within us.

872
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,600
This is the, of course, is the time of Aquarius, no doubt.

873
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,331
You see, so many people have predicted.

874
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:30,106
But I don't know, people cannot locate it

875
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:33,594
or they're still in the dark, they just do not know.

876
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,079
And

877
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,757
I think next century we'll have beautiful people all around us,

878
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,800
no, no troubles of wars,

879
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,880
very peaceful we'll be all sitting in the kingdom of God.

880
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:51,050
SY: And you could be there in next lifetime if not this.

881
00:50:51,297 --> 00:50:53,182
B: Why talk of that?

882
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:57,932
I'm not ashamed, I don't have the idea.

883
00:50:58,318 --> 00:50:59,809
SY: It's a question over here?

884
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:01,602
L: Can You tell me, how it's possible

885
00:51:01,803 --> 00:51:04,639
feeling oneself through the fingertips?

886
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,960
SY: She'd like a little more information

887
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,182
about feeling oneself through the fingertips.

888
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:13,600
SM: First of all you must get your Realization, all right?

889
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,520
But still I can show you here as they have shown it.

890
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,720
There are seven chakras, like one,

891
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,640
two, three, four, five, six and seven.

892
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,280
Now they're shown there. Now the first chakra is shown here,

893
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,760
the red chakra is the first chakra and

894
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,520
then the second chakra is shown here

895
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,840
you see. And this one is the Vishuddhi what we call,

896
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,880
is the chakra there, the throat, here, this.

897
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,120
And this one is the, on the navel, Nabhi

898
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,360
and third one is the Agnya chakra,

899
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,360
is the chakra here, of Christ, here.

900
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,840
And then we have the last chakra, is the Sahasrara

901
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,600
is the thousand petals lotus in the brain,

902
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,480
around the limbic area. That's the limbic area.

903
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,625
The Kundalini passes through all these chakras,

904
00:52:02,826 --> 00:52:04,900
through the parasympathetic nervous system

905
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:09,761
and pierces through the fontanel bone area from the limbic area.

906
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:14,649
L: Mother, you are saying (one's chakras) are going to be feed...

907
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,615
SY: "Feel", "feel" not "feed".

908
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:19,180
She thought You said "feed".

909
00:52:19,381 --> 00:52:24,376
SM: No, no, no, I said "feel". I said: f, e, e, l - feel. All right?

910
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,830
L: She's said, she asked the question

911
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:29,314
"You said that's the Self Realization, Mother,

912
00:52:29,515 --> 00:52:34,318
then what about when you only feel that energy it's in your hands?

913
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:36,280
I know a lot of people

914
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:39,178
get very, very contact with the energy in their hands.

915
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:42,356
Now, You say that these people are realized people already?

916
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:45,269
SY: She's wondering about people who already feel

917
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,515
these energies in the hand. Are they already realized?

918
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:51,440
SM: Cool, cool. They should feel cool vibrations, cool vibrations,

919
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,560
then they are already, their Kundalini is awakened.

920
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,299
So such people should know what it is, you see.

921
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,289
There are many people who are realized souls

922
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,996
who are born as realized souls but they don't know what it is,

923
00:53:02,197 --> 00:53:03,393
they don't know how to use it.

924
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:06,849
They must know everything, isn't it? Is important.

925
00:53:08,636 --> 00:53:10,680
SY: Do a lot of realised souls now living?

926
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:13,384
SM: Yes, I mean, at least many children I have seen

927
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:15,416
are born realized children,

928
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:18,115
many children are and they put their fingers to show

929
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:20,470
this is catching, that is catching of their parents.

930
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:22,570
And sometimes when the parents come before Me,

931
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:25,443
they jump on their back, try to correct their Kundalinis.

932
00:53:25,644 --> 00:53:29,680
Yes, it's true, children, many children are born realised, nowadays.

933
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,761
SY: Last question. There's new, a new one.

934
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:41,497
B: I, I am very sad but [what You say it's] karma yoga

935
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:46,238
but yoga is not possible

936
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:50,122
for us, for a lot of people - only for saints.

937
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:53,258
The only yoga that is possible is karma yoga.

938
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:55,062
SY: The only?

939
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:57,341
SM: Karma yoga.
B: Karma yoga, yes.

940
00:53:57,524 --> 00:54:00,719
Now, I say it is possible

941
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,292
and it is verily possible.

942
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:07,160
And the karma part of it, when the Kundalini moves,

943
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:09,719
She awakenes this centre of Christ.

944
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,520
Now we said that Christ has died for our sins, isnt' it?

945
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,206
He sucks in, he sucks in that yellow stuff

946
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:21,920
which is our karmas, you see - it is the ego part of it.

947
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,836
That is sucked in - then if you are no more there

948
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:27,371
who does the karmas?

949
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:36,160
When your ego is not there, who does the karmas?

950
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,240
Then you start talking in third person -

951
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,029
you come into akarmas.

952
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,988
You start saying: "Mother, it's not moving,

953
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:45,818
it's not coming", you say like that.

954
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,600
You don't say, "I'm not doing it". You say, "It's not coming" -

955
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,566
in the third person you start talking.

956
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:53,663
It becomes akarma, as described in the Gita,

957
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:55,839
it becomes akarma.

958
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,160
They will go on saying like this because they can't do it.

959
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:04,432
SY: Perhaps Realization now, Mother?

960
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:08,453
Perhaps Realization now, Mother? SM: All right.

961
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,279
Now there is a simple thing you have to do,

962
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,160
little bit to cooperate with Me,

963
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,400
is first of all we have to take out our shoes,

964
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,830
to take the help of the Mother Earth - that's all.

965
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:25,551
Because we have to take the help of all the...

966
00:55:38,056 --> 00:55:40,735
But it is going to work out.

967
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,720
The first thing is, you have to forgive yourself.

968
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:50,319
and you have to be in a very pleasant mood.

969
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,893
First of all, you must forgive yourself,

970
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:56,083
whatever mistakes you have committed, whatever wrong you have done,

971
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,504
 don't count them.

972
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,360
So you are not guilty at all of anything.

973
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:04,291
That you must remember;

974
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:07,287
because that is not the mood

975
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:10,622
in which you should enter the kingdom of God.

976
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,235
So you should know that now,

977
00:56:13,418 --> 00:56:15,471
there is no guilt in you,

978
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,440
nothing has been done wrong by you.

979
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,644
Don't curse yourself, don't blame yourself,

980
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,438
don't say that you are wrong,

981
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:28,280
you have done this wrong and that wrong and you go on counting them.

982
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,613
That would help you a lot if you just say

983
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:34,603
that, "Mother, I am not guilty".

984
00:56:34,786 --> 00:56:36,981
That's all you have to say, within yourself.

985
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:40,560
With full confidence you have to say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

986
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,720
Then I am going to teach you how to raise your own Kundalini

987
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,326
because she asked the question if it stops and all that.

988
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,959
It's very simple how to raise your own Kundalini

989
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,470
so even if it stops,

990
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:53,466
you can go on raising it again and again and it will work out.

991
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:56,859
You will yourself raise the Kundalini today.

992
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,960
But I'll tell you how to do it.

993
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,880
You have to put your left hand towards Me like this.

994
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,400
Now left hand, I couldn't tell you in the whole lecture today...

995
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,280
Just like this, on your lap, just like this, on your lap.

996
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,080
I didn't tell in your lecture today...  I think I should stand up,

997
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,481
it would be better for the backside people to see.

998
00:57:21,296 --> 00:57:23,816
Now you can see Me?

999
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,080
You put your left hand towards Me like this, just like this.

1000
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,120
Be comfortable, be comfortable.

1001
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,440
Those who are sitting can put it on their laps just.

1002
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,920
This is to symbolize or to say

1003
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,200
that this is the power of desire.

1004
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,054
This is what you are desiring, to have Realization,

1005
00:58:02,255 --> 00:58:04,079
that's why putting the hand towards Me.

1006
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,824
This is just the power of desire.

1007
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:13,080
This is the hand that does the action so it has the power of action.

1008
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,200
So this is the hand we are going to use for raising our Kundalini.

1009
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,000
But we are going to work only on the left hand side.

1010
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,200
First I'll tell you. Keep your eyes open and see for yourself.

1011
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,120
First only, this left hand will be towards Me,

1012
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,160
right hand on the heart.

1013
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,080
Then,

1014
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,322
it goes down in the upper part of your abdomen.

1015
00:58:37,529 --> 00:58:39,359
Press it there.

1016
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,920
There's a centre, on the left hand side,

1017
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,440
there's a centre within us, on the left hand side, here.

1018
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,328
Then put it down here,

1019
00:58:47,511 --> 00:58:50,222
on the lower part of the abdomen and press it there.

1020
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,760
There's another centre there.

1021
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,327
Then you come back again onto the upper part of the abdomen,

1022
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:00,640
there's a centre there - very important centre.

1023
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,740
And from this centre you come back to the heart.

1024
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,679
Now from here you have to go to the centre which is placed between,

1025
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,760
this we call as left Vishuddhi,

1026
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,549
between you neck and your shoulder here and

1027
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:22,200
turn your face towards right, like this.

1028
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,360
for a while. here is the centre is caught up when you are guilty.

1029
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,919
That's why I said you should not feel guilty at all.

1030
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:37,586
After that, you have to open your hand

1031
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:41,784
and put it on your forehead and press it hard,

1032
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:43,880
on both the sides.

1033
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,840
This is the centre of Christ.

1034
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,161
Then you have to go back

1035
00:59:48,362 --> 00:59:53,173
and put your hand on the backside of your head

1036
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:56,999
and push it back, like that. Let it rest there.

1037
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,960
Now, you have to stretch your hand

1038
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,560
and in the centre of your hand, here,

1039
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,800
you put this on top of the fontanel bone area,

1040
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,200
which was the soft bone when you were a child.

1041
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,049
Put it there and press it hard, the scalp,

1042
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,473
pressing out the fingers,

1043
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,440
seven times, slowly. That's all.

1044
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,159
And that's how you get your Realization. It's very simple.

1045
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,280
Now let's do it again, with closed eyes.

1046
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,000
Will you please take out your spectacles?

1047
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,141
Because it helps your eyesight also.

1048
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,120
You shouldn't open your eyes till I tell you,

1049
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,480
so you won't need your spectacles at all.

1050
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,400
Anybody who is feeling uncomfortable here

1051
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,560
or in the neck or anything, can loosen it a little bit.

1052
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:53,910
So to feel absolutely, absolutely clear-cut.

1053
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:56,384
Now, there's nothing to worry,

1054
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,696
it has not happened anything to anyone.

1055
01:00:58,897 --> 01:01:02,520
Everybody will feel very much better. All right.

1056
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,760
New Zealand people are really beautiful the way

1057
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,480
they are anxious to get their Realization.

1058
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,680
So very happy to meet them, really.

1059
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,959
Isn't it?

1060
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,165
All right. Now, left hand towards Me.

1061
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,864
This you should not move. Keep the left hand towards Me.

1062
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:23,584
You can keep it on your lap, if you find it comfortable

1063
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:25,520
on your lap or any way.

1064
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,080
Now, the right hand.

1065
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,754
Before putting the right hand, you close your eyes now.

1066
01:01:29,955 --> 01:01:32,840
Close your eyes. Take out your spectacles - is better.

1067
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,537
Take out your spectacles,

1068
01:01:34,738 --> 01:01:39,840
because it might make you feel little awkward or maybe...

1069
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,000
Put it on your heart. Now, close your eyes.

1070
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,079
Please don't open your eyes till I tell you.

1071
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,960
Now here, is a very important question you have to ask Me

1072
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,120
because here resides the Spirit.

1073
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,800
So you ask Me a question three times, "Mother,

1074
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,440
am I, am I the Spirit?"

1075
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,160
You can call Me Shri Mataji if possible

1076
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,160
or call Me Mother, that's easier.

1077
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:12,240
Mother, am I the Spirit?

1078
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,920
Three times. Is very important question, in your heart.

1079
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,760
Ask this question in your heart.

1080
01:02:22,616 --> 01:02:25,679
Put your hand on your heart. Right hand on your heart.

1081
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,646
Right hand on your heart, yes, on your heart, on your heart, yes.

1082
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,959
Please keep your eyes shut.

1083
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,639
Now, move the right hand. Left hand as it is,

1084
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,374
right hand in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left hand side,

1085
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:43,786
upper part of the abdomen.

1086
01:02:44,638 --> 01:02:47,600
Now, is very good.

1087
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,560
Now, this is the centre of your mastery.

1088
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,855
All the prophets who came on this earth

1089
01:02:53,056 --> 01:02:55,538
have established this centre for you

1090
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:59,920
so that you can master - you become a master of yourself.

1091
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,000
So now, ask a question to Me, second question,

1092
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,446
"Mother, am I my own master?".

1093
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,657
Ask Me a question, three times,

1094
01:03:07,848 --> 01:03:10,871
"Mother, am I my own master?"

1095
01:03:28,624 --> 01:03:30,636
Take down your right hand

1096
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:34,040
in the lower part of the abdomen and press it hard.

1097
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,160
This is the centre through which we work out the divine laws,

1098
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,840
one of the most important centre that way.

1099
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,880
So now here you have to ask Me -

1100
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:49,022
because I cannot force you to get it - you have to ask Me.

1101
01:03:49,223 --> 01:03:51,240
So please ask Me six times

1102
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,640
because this centre has got six petals,

1103
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,360
"Mother, may I have pure knowledge?".

1104
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,008
"Mother, may I have pure knowledge?"

1105
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:03,953
Pure knowledge.

1106
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:13,448
Is good.

1107
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,800
Six times, please.

1108
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,080
Now, raise this hand again up,

1109
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,793
on the left side of your abdomen,

1110
01:04:38,768 --> 01:04:41,848
on the upper part of it. Now press it here.

1111
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,223
Now, as you have asked Me the question

1112
01:04:44,398 --> 01:04:46,365
to give you the pure knowledge,

1113
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,257
the Kundalini has started moving.

1114
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:51,800
So now, at this point, so try to cooperate with the Kundalini

1115
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,919
by saying, "Mother, I am my master".

1116
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,638
Please say it ten times, "Mother, I am my master".

1117
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,160
Please say it ten times.

1118
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,440
"Mother, I am my master". Have faith in yourself.

1119
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,040
With full confidence, please say, "Mother, I am my master".

1120
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,120
That's a fact.

1121
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,760
Ten times.

1122
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,160
Now, raise your hand to your heart.

1123
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,720
Here, with the self-confidence, full self-confidence

1124
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,680
you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1125
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,800
This is twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit",

1126
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,700
to make the Kundalini move faster upward.

1127
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:52,399
"Mother, I am the Spirit". This is the truth.

1128
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,960
The truth is you are the Spirit.

1129
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,960
"Mother, I am the Spirit".

1130
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,640
Say it twelve times, please.

1131
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,714
Now, we have to know that God Almighty

1132
01:06:05,897 --> 01:06:09,879
is the ocean of love and grace,

1133
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,959
but above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

1134
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,952
So, He forgives whatever mistakes we commit.

1135
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:20,399
After all, we are human beings so we commit mistakes.

1136
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:26,960
So it would be better that you raise your right hand, now,

1137
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,800
on your shoulder, between the corner of the shoulder and the neck

1138
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,560
and put your head towards the right.

1139
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,760
Now, here, press it hard and say for,

1140
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,200
with full confidence in yourself,

1141
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,160
"Mother, I am not guilty", sixteen times, please.

1142
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,360
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

1143
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:52,964
As I have told you,

1144
01:06:53,165 --> 01:06:57,560
you have to be absolutely pleasantly placed towards yourself.

1145
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,640
Now, those who still don't want to forgive themselves

1146
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,960
can say it 108 times to take the punishment.

1147
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,640
Put it on here.

1148
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,840
That's very important this centre is, very important.

1149
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,040
Put your head towards the right.

1150
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,360
Good. Sixteen times.

1151
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,719
Now,

1152
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,280
raise your hand again to your forehead across

1153
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,037
and press it hard.

1154
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:54,880
Now, here, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone, everyone".

1155
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:00,080
Now one should not think that it is difficult to forgive.

1156
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,975
After all, we forgive or not forgive, we do not do anything.

1157
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,240
But when we do not forgive

1158
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,669
then we are playing into the hands of wrong people.

1159
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:14,400
So better forgive.

1160
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,080
Everyone you forgive - don't count them.

1161
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,679
Forgive them from your heart, how many times is not the point.

1162
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,280
From your heart, just forgive them.

1163
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,076
It's very hot.

1164
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,280
Now, put the hand on the backside of your head.

1165
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,298
And now, place your hand on the backside

1166
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,825
and put the load of your head on that

1167
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:54,800
and now here, for your own satisfaction you can say,

1168
01:08:55,001 --> 01:08:59,240
"Mother, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me",

1169
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,195
or "Oh, Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me" -

1170
01:09:02,396 --> 01:09:04,719
just for your own satisfaction.

1171
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,400
It's not necessary to say.

1172
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,920
Now, say it from your heart.

1173
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:20,605
Now, open your hands, properly.

1174
01:09:22,016 --> 01:09:26,273
Put the hand on the top of the fontanel bone area, in the centre,

1175
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:31,433
press it hard and move it seven times, seven times.

1176
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:37,280
Here you have to ask Me for Self-Realization. I cannot force on you.

1177
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,400
So you have to say seven times

1178
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,096
"Mother, please give us Self-Realization".

1179
01:09:42,297 --> 01:09:44,805
I cannot force on you.

1180
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,843
May God bless you.

1181
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:44,560
Now take down your hand and open your eyes slowly.

1182
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,120
Now, put your right hand towards Me,

1183
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,100
instead of the left and put your left hand on top of your head.

1184
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:54,393
And see for yourself,

1185
01:10:54,594 --> 01:10:56,993
have you got the cool breeze coming out of your head?

1186
01:10:57,194 --> 01:10:58,827
Put it on the fontanel; just move.

1187
01:10:59,028 --> 01:11:02,304
Some people get it very high, some people get it very...

1188
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:07,197
Yes, it's there. Just keep it on this side, this side, here.

1189
01:11:07,398 --> 01:11:11,480
You can bend your head and see if you want to - would be easier.

1190
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,040
Now, put the left hand towards Me

1191
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,240
and put the right hand and see for yourself

1192
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,520
if you got the cool breeze in your head.

1193
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,480
It's good.

1194
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,601
Now put again the right hand towards Me

1195
01:11:35,802 --> 01:11:38,071
and see with the left hand.

1196
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,607
Now you can raise both the hands towards the sky

1197
01:11:45,808 --> 01:11:47,527
and ask a question in your heart,

1198
01:11:47,728 --> 01:11:49,730
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1199
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:53,160
Holy Ghost is the Kundalini. Holy Ghost is the Kundalini.

1200
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,680
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?",

1201
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,800
"Is this the cool breeze of God's love?",

1202
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,280
"Is this the Paramachaitanya?"

1203
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,145
Just ask the question. Put the head back and ask the question,

1204
01:12:05,346 --> 01:12:07,640
three times, any question you feel like.

1205
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,480
Three times.

1206
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:15,839
Now, bring it down.

1207
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,560
Now, see for yourself; you feel peaceful inside and relaxed.

1208
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,440
You watch Me without thinking. You can do it, very easily.

1209
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,333
Now, see.

1210
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,600
It's coming from you to Me. It's so great.

1211
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,751
Now, those who have felt

1212
01:12:40,942 --> 01:12:44,516
cool breeze on top of their heads or in their hands,

1213
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:47,440
you have to raise both the hands - those who have felt it.

1214
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,160
Those who have felt cool breeze in the hands -

1215
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,640
higher up like that, just Me to see.

1216
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,110
Those who have felt cool breeze in their hands

1217
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:57,068
or on top of their hands,

1218
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:59,300
 should raise their hands.

1219
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,800
So many of you have felt it!

1220
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,769

1221
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,840
Didn't feel it? All right, we'll see about.

01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,071
Most of you have felt it.

1223
01:13:09,272 --> 01:13:10,553
May God bless you.

1224
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,847
Those who didn't do it, would not feel. naturally.

1225
01:13:13,048 --> 01:13:14,204
This lady didn't do anything

1226
01:13:14,405 --> 01:13:17,159
so she would not feel anything. It's all right.

1227
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,192
May God bless you.

1228
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:24,391
Now, you can just see this gentleman, what's the matter with him?

1229
01:13:24,592 --> 01:13:27,160
One-two people should see, one or two people there I saw.

1230
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,000
You didn't feel the cool breeze? No? All right.

1231
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,730
So can you come out a little bit these boys, these can see.

1232
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:35,727
Now, just see him. He is outside.

Niko, just, Niko here just see, this gentleman, didn't feel it.

I'm sorry, but he should, he should. Yes, just you should feel it.

1235
01:13:46,727 --> 01:13:49,687
Just see, what's the problem.

1236
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:59,800
Done now? Feeling peaceful and happy now?

1237
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,879
B: Which year did You meet Mahatma Gandhi?

1238
01:14:05,726 --> 01:14:08,040
Which year were you with Mahatma Ghandi?

1239
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,787
SM: I was there with him from seven years of age.

1240
01:14:10,994 --> 01:14:12,979
B: Which year? What year?

1241
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,180
SM: Must be 7...

1242
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:18,659
1923 and seven.

1243
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,040
B: 1930? 1930?

1244
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:23,381
SM: 1930.

1245
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,240
Civil disobedience, civil disobedience's time, yes.

1246
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,680
My father was with him, mother was with him,

1247
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,440
the whole family.

1248
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,525
But specially Me, I lived with him, personally with him. Yes.

1249
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,320
You didn't feel on the head?

1250
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,040
Now, you just ask, "Mother come in my head".

1251
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,208
Just say that if you didn't feel in the (head).

1252
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:49,695
Just say that, it will come.

1253
01:14:49,896 --> 01:14:51,761
Again.

1254
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:56,440
See it again.

1255
01:14:57,982 --> 01:15:00,236
Now just see.

1256
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,781
There?

1257
01:15:03,154 --> 01:15:06,760
It's there. Whatever you ask you'll get it.

1258
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,840
Now you got it madam. All of you. Very good.

1259
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,479
Now this gentleman, you just see, this. He should get it, actually.

1260
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,440
He's read too much I think.

1261
01:15:16,757 --> 01:15:18,225
Devi, come along.

1262
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,007
Now you all can give Realization. You all can see.

1263
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:24,839
You can see each other's heads also. You can see each other head,

1264
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,733
to convince yourself.

1265
01:15:26,934 --> 01:15:28,759
Just see what's her problem.

1266
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,833
I think Nabhi.

1267
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:34,254
Little liver problem he has. That's all.

1268
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,880
Ask him to put his left hand on the liver. That's all.

1269
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,600
Left hand on the liver. That side, that side.

1270
01:15:43,992 --> 01:15:47,159
Yes, that side. Yes, that' it. And right hand towards Me. That' all.

1271
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,587
Now, see. Put both the feet on the...

1272
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,991
Yes, now see.

1273
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,896
They work out from the back.

1274
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:58,158
[Hindi/Marathi]

1275
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:05,765
To (then - in Hindi) balanced you? Are you imbalanced?

1276
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,948
Ask him what work he does.

1277
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:13,454
Give him a balance also.

1278
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:15,839
Give this gentleman a balance, he will be all right.

1279
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,960
Right sided. Just give him a balance. Left to the right.

1280
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,880
Move it left to the right.

1281
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,600
You must forgive. Did you forgive, Sir?

1282
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,849
Did you really, from your heart?

1283
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:34,279
All right, then you must...

1284
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,080
Now, are you feeling the cool breeze?

1285
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,392
No?

1286
01:16:44,638 --> 01:16:48,279
There is in the head. Little bit it has started. You will.

1287
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,631
Maybe, Vishuddhi may be wrong or something.

1288
01:16:58,432 --> 01:17:00,857
All of them have got it.

1289
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,839
Now one has to laugh, that's all, and enjoy.

1290
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,280
Nothing to worry. You have entered into the Kingdom of God

1291
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,341
and you'll be surprised how you are helped.

1292
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,019
Everything is over now.

1293
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,780
The one who didn't get there.

1294
01:17:13,981 --> 01:17:18,036
Somebody... Can you come down to this side, my child? This side.

1295
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,320
Come this side, this side.

1296
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,041
If you can get out and come out, will be good idea.

1297
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,217
No, no, she is coming, David she is coming this side.

1298
01:17:30,418 --> 01:17:31,916
Now, where are others?

1299
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:34,319
Mary, you see her.

1300
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,872
Or someone? You need to balance her.

1301
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:38,939
Just, she will see you.

1302
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,110
This gentleman with the...

1303
01:17:46,472 --> 01:17:48,839
Have you been to any guru or anyone?

1304
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:51,425
No one so far?

1305
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,336
You, did you feel now?

1306
01:17:57,537 --> 01:18:01,613
In the head they did feel, but in the hands did not.

1307
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,200
Because this center is little bit heavy.

1308
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,120
It will loosen out. But in the head they have felt it.

1309
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,480
You can feel it on his head madam, you yourself.

1310
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,037
You, you can feel it, the neighbor, yes you can feel it.

1311
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,204
Just see.

1312
01:18:19,312 --> 01:18:21,573
Is it there?

1313
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:26,498
Now?

1314
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:28,744
Not yet?

1315
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,560
Some people might feel the heat. That's all right doesn't matter,

1316
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,880
the heat will be replaced by the cool breeze.

1317
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,217
But first the heat can come into some people.

1318
01:18:59,408 --> 01:19:03,383
No? You were busy with the child.

1319
01:19:03,626 --> 01:19:05,107

1320
01:19:05,283 --> 01:19:06,965

1321
01:19:07,148 --> 01:19:10,568

1322
01:19:12,596 --> 01:19:15,159
