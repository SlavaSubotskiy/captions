1
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:39,269
It is very, very fortunate and auspicious

2
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:50,577
that we are celebrating the Diwali in Greece, specially in Delphi.

3
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,607
It has a very ancient history,

4
00:03:53,727 --> 00:04:01,907
and as you know Athena resided here. She was the Primordial Mother.

5
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:06,300
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial.”

6
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,719
So this place has been described, has been described

7
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:19,615
even in the Puranas as “Manipur [navel] dvipa [island].”

8
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,845
Manipur is the Nabhi.

9
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:25,076
Also in Sanskrit Manipur means the Nabhi Chakra.

10
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:29,000
So it’s described as the Manipur dvipa,

11
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,598
is written “Manipur e dvipa.”

12
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,722
Just imagine these Puranas, these ancient-time books

13
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:39,083
– God knows how old they are,

14
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:43,405
must be at least eight thousand or maybe more –

15
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,997
and they have described Greece as the Manipur dvipa,

16
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:51,789
is the place of Nabhi and where resides the Adi Shakti,

17
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,614
that’s the Athena.

18
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:56,292
So I mean, how it was known to them

19
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,060
– maybe through torsion area, I would say;

20
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,894
but it is written very clearly, and same we find here

21
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:09,091
is the place of Athena which is in the Nabhi.

22
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:15,170
Also Athena is the Primordial Mother,

23
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:27,984
they say expressed Herself first in the sea on the Nabhi itself.

24
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:36,085
From there She did all Her work.

25
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:41,781
Now we can say that in Her movement,

26
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:52,466
when She came down as existence She created Shri Ganesha

27
00:05:52,586 --> 00:06:02,694
and then She went to the right side and created Mahasaraswati,

28
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:09,590
the, we can say, the whole universe, all creations She created.

29
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,936
And then She came down,

30
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:19,677
came down and settled as Kundalini;

31
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:24,617
but coming down She created Mahalakshmi Principle,

32
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:29,754
which is for our ascent. This was Her movement,

33
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:35,269
but it is said that She incarnated in the Nabhi,

34
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:42,499
because maybe after doing all this She incarnated in the Nabhi,

35
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,210
and also we see that Ganesha’s Kundalini is in the Nabhi.

36
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,145
She incarnated in the Nabhi, they say, because the first pure knowledge,,

37
00:06:54,265 --> 00:07:01,396
pure desire of a person or animal or anybody is hunger.

38
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:04,317
That is in the Nabhi.

39
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:13,490
And this hunger She wanted to satisfy or to direct or to handle,

40
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:19,330
and that might be the reason She might have first come to the Nabhi.

41
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:24,782
Now this Primordial Mother that we have as Athena

42
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:33,900
also has in Her hand a Kundalini, also She has one trident.

43
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,208
All this is sign that when She was born

44
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:40,370
She knew that She has to fight the evil forces

45
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,482
in the Nabhi Chakra.

46
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:48,252
All this history is really shown very clearly

47
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:51,540
in the Greek mythology,

48
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,372
but later on this mythology took a very, very wrong path

49
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:59,004
through human beings, as they know how to spoil everything.

50
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:04,774
So what they did is to make all the gods and goddesses

51
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:10,154
look like human beings, and so we have here,

52
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:18,376
many gods which are in India,

53
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:23,265
they are represented even in the Greek mythology.

54
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:28,205
But the Indian gods are kept very pure and really godly and saintly,

55
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:32,178
but here it was brought down to the level of human beings.

56
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:34,579
And so many gods who were there

57
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:40,179
were shown to be little different from Indian gods,

58
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:43,388
because they made it human.

59
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:49,189
It’s very surprising how it was deviated

60
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,414
gradually from one to another.

61
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:56,059
Even in India it’s done but it doesn’t stay,

62
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:58,340
because we have Puranas.

63
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,836
So every time people try to ruin it and spoil it,

64
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:05,999
it goes back to the normal state because we have Puranas.

65
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:11,886
But Puranas are not worshipped like Bible or like Koran

66
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,786
or like any other such religious book,

67
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:20,134
but they are just relating the history of the ancient times;

68
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:25,653
and one has to just see it that it is intelligible,

69
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,885
this can be explained, people can know about it.

70
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:35,474
But the way they have described about Manipur dvipa

71
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:41,005
was very much really great, and even at the time of Alexander,

72
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:46,684
Greece was a very prosperous, extremely beautiful state.

73
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:52,952
Because it is described by Chand Bardai,

74
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:55,489
one of the poet who came with him here,

75
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:59,582
and he has described into all details what things are.

76
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,315
And he has also described that there’s a temple

77
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:10,171
of the Primordial Mother, very clearly, of the Adi Shakti,

78
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,928
and there is the Ganesha is also sitting there.

79
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:15,682
He has described it in all details.

80
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:23,105
Also the steps going to the temple are three-and-a-half, he says.

81
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:26,998
Three are big ones and the last one is half way.

82
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:33,121
And if you make, extend them to the whole world

83
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:37,128
it can make a three-and-a-half coils.

84
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:44,525
Also very clearly he said that there are swayambhu,

85
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,695
swayambhu of Shri Ganesha.

86
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:49,896
And also about Oracle of Delphi they say

87
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,249
that in the Nabhi Chakra the gods speak.

88
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,636
All this is described in India much before,

89
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:01,502
much, much before Alexander came to India,

90
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:04,743
and from that we can understand

91
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:08,980
that there might have been much more rapport, maybe; maybe

92
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,983
many people were going abroad or maybe coming here,

93
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,761
or may be from the torsion area

94
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:19,617
that all the Puranas were written down.

95
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:24,115
So it’s absolutely an ancient place we are in,

96
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:29,817
which is truthful in its description and everything, no doubt,

97
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:33,571
but later on the deterioration came, took place.

98
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:37,177
Also here there is question of Kundalini was there,

99
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,808
and the chakras were painted also.

100
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,825
But when Christianity came they said,

101
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,865
“It’s all bogus, forget it,”

102
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,709
and they didn’t want to see to the other side of it.

103
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,812
And that is how it became just a kind of a history also,

104
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:55,289
that was not so clean and clear.

105
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:03,844
The faith in Athena subsided,

106
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:08,076
faith in all the gods and goddesses also subsided

107
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,283
and it started becoming this, actually we can say

108
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:14,515
it was disappearing nicely.

109
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:19,785
This was the situation of this Greece. Now again we are back.

110
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,852
In the “Manipur e Dvipa” we are sitting down nicely,

111
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:28,642
and for Lakshmi Puja, which is in the Nabhi.

112
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:32,305
Lakshmi came out of water, no doubt,

113
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:36,372
but Athena is the Mother of Lakshmi.

114
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:45,254
She is the One who is all-pervading, and She created Lakshmi,

115
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:48,349
and this Lakshmi is the One that ruled here

116
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:53,114
and She was very much manifesting.

117
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:58,498
And She created beautiful things here,

118
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:04,237
because they were very rich people, Greeks were very rich;

119
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:07,553
and they were indulging into all kinds of things,

120
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:11,418
specially in business, then in shipping.

121
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:16,350
Shipping is their one of the most important business,

122
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,629
and I came with My husband here because he was a shipping man.

123
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,244
And I was surprised that at the airport

124
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:28,310
we had the minister’s wife, another minister’s wife,

125
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,797
Prime Minister’s wife. I was surprised, normally they never go

126
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:35,347
to receive any lady missus who comes.

127
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:38,097
“No, no,” they said. “You see what happened

128
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,768
that our husbands told us, ‘If you really want to see a lady

129
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:49,022
who is absolutely, immaculately feminine and very auspicious

130
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:53,081
and very serene, then it is Mrs. Srivastava.’”

131
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,672
So they came to see Me, imagine them!

132
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:01,329
The idea of serenity doesn’t exist now for women in the world,

133
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,538
but these ladies came to see Me that

134
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:06,800
“who is this serene lady who has come?”

135
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,821
And they looked after Me very well,

136
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:12,499
and then afterwards there was an election coming also.

137
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,702
But I don’t forget the way they told Me and very respectfully,

138
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,570
they said, “How did You develop this serenity?”

139
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,224
I said, “I didn’t develop. It was just existing.

140
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:27,577
I didn’t do anything to look serene or in any way work it out.

141
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:29,938
There is no beauty parlor for that

142
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:33,107
but it is something innate in Me,

143
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,928
what if you think it was serenity.” She said,

144
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:39,274
“No, no, all the men praised about You that

145
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:44,111
‘She is a person who is, even in these horrible days,

146
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,758
is extremely serene.’”

147
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:50,817
Now Diwali is very significant because

148
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:59,437
today is the darkest day, darkest night and longest night,

149
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:03,639
and to end it up they put lights.

150
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:08,822
Now in the atmosphere it’s all very dark, black,

151
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:13,786
the sun is gone. So they put on all these lights.

152
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:16,687
In the same way it is Kali Yuga.

153
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:20,958
Now, Kali Yuga you can consider as one day.

154
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,745
It’s very dark, horrible, it has lots of problems,

155
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:28,149
it’s made our lives miserable

156
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,251
and we don’t know how to move with life.

157
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:37,955
At this moment what is necessary is to enlighten people.

158
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:40,514
Kali Yuga at its worst now.

159
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,994
The kind of things people are doing even in the name of God

160
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:47,226
is shocking. But that is Kali Yuga,

161
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,753
where we have lost all sense of direction.

162
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,846
We don’t know which way we are going.

163
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,436
All kinds of wrong things we are doing

164
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,496
and we think it’s all right, after all what’s wrong in it?

165
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:03,823
Everything you tell them – “what’s wrong?”

166
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:07,862
You tell them, “Don’t do it.” They’ll say, “What’s wrong?”

167
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,673
And that’s how every human being has very,

168
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:15,097
become very individualistic. In a way he’s not,

169
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:19,205
because they follow a fashion, they follow a style

170
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:22,106
– I mean they are not, they are slavish –

171
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,267
but they believe they are very independent,

172
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:27,061
they are free people, they can do whatever they like.

173
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,954
As a result of this freedom in this Kali Yuga

174
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:34,545
or the idea of freedom, what has happened with them is that

175
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:38,543
they have become extremely ugly.

176
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:44,245
The kind of things they are doing in Kali Yuga is unbelievable.

177
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:47,341
Even when they are priests, they are in the churches,

178
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:51,984
this thing, that thing, they become so horribly immoral

179
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,575
that cannot believe how can that be

180
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:57,984
in the name of God, under this roof of God?

181
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:01,362
But it has started, that is Kali Yuga.

182
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,915
And this Kali Yuga has to be finished.

183
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:11,205
So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night

184
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,287
is to put lights.

185
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,060
In the same way people should be enlightened.

186
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,072
There should be light in the heart of people.

187
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,218
Once they’re enlightened, this darkness

188
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:27,375
from which we are suffering because of our ignorance

189
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:31,964
will be finished and we’ll have the absolute knowledge.

190
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,751
So this is a new age that they are talking about is here

191
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:42,268
right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner

192
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:48,033
that it will be all enlightened personalities together,

193
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:54,763
and they’ll know what is light is, what is real knowledge, gyana.

194
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:58,649
So ours is a path of knowledge:

195
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:04,172
knowledge that is love, knowledge that is compassion.

196
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,946
This is what we have to understand,

197
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:12,647
that we have come into another area, arena, where

198
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:20,909
all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.

199
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:23,543
It’s raining outside, nothing inside

200
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:29,123
– it’s like that, that we are now not only free,

201
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,666
but whatever we are doing is nothing but freedom;

202
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:38,432
where we are not attached to anything that can debase us,

203
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:42,702
make us lose grip over truth.

204
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:47,211
When such a personality is brought in then what happens,

205
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:51,394
that all these ideas of Kali Yuga will disappear.

206
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:55,988
But I must say, it’s the Last Judgment at the same time.

207
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:58,626
Those who accept the truth

208
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:02,806
and reside in truth and grow in truth will remain,

209
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:06,468
all other will be perished – is said already.

210
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,885
Like you see a garden in which there are some trees

211
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:18,017
who are nourished well, who get lot of water and love,

212
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:24,376
and who give also so much to people they exist.

213
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,929
The others are burnt down and finished.

214
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,106
In the same way you have to first accept the love,

215
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:36,548
take the love, nourish yourself with that love

216
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:39,583
and then you give to others.

217
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:48,360
This is a simple way you can overcome the Kali Yuga’s curses.

218
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,731
Kali Yuga is so much full of darkness

219
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,847
that we start hitting each other.

220
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:00,672
For example you are all sitting here. Suddenly it becomes dark.

221
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,968
You don’t know how to move, whether you are hitting others or not,

222
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:06,542
with whom are you sitting, nothing, in the same way.

223
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:10,550
With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind

224
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,596
that you don’t know where are you, what are you doing

225
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:17,162
and what you should be doing,

226
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,976
just like going amok you go on hitting each other.

227
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:26,745
This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it

228
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:30,328
and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.

229
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:33,642
Otherwise you are just like other people

230
00:20:33,762 --> 00:20:36,779
if you are still indulging into the same periphery,

231
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:43,814
in the same circles of imbalance.

232
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:47,917
Now another thing with Kali Yuga is this,

233
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:53,634
that even if you are hit or even if you are destroyed

234
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,730
they just don’t blame themselves.

235
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,082
Is a another horrible temperament one develops

236
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:04,586
that you blame others, never yourself.

237
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:08,097
That it is your mistake that you hit yourself.

238
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:11,967
It was you did wrong and that’s what it is.

239
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,697
This is the, what we call is the illusion, is the bhrama,

240
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:20,205
and this illusion has to go away.

241
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:24,346
And for Kali Yuga it is said this is the era of illusions,

242
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:30,523
and this illusion, if you fall into it you are finished.

243
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:35,001
But if you see the illusions then you try to seek the truth.

244
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:38,448
That’s why today the seeking is very strong,

245
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,902
because they can feel it’s an illusion.

246
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:44,421
It’s not the truth, they know.

247
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,149
And once they know it is not the truth, what do they do?

248
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,133
They want to know what is the truth,

249
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:53,051
where is the truth and they try to find it.

250
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:58,451
That’s how also in this Kali Yuga the seeking has started.

251
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:02,602
The story about Kali Yuga is told in also another Purana,

252
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:07,843
of Damayanti Purana where Damayanti, the wife of Nala,

253
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:14,428
was separated from him because of the same illusions created by Kali.

254
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:25,150
So one day it happened that Nala got hold of this horrible Kali

255
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,556
and he said, “Now I am going to strangle you and finish you off.”

256
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,512
So Kali said, “All right, you can do it,

257
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:35,275
but first listen to my importance, my mahatmya

258
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,532
– what importance I have, why I am there.”

259
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:40,099
So he waited.

260
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:44,796
He said, “Now agree, if you listen to me I’ll tell you.

261
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:48,245
When I will come and I will rule the world

262
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,586
– means when there will be Kali Yuga –

263
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:55,408
people will get into bhranti, means illusions.

264
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:58,487
They will not know whether this is truth or not

265
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:02,055
and they will then try to seek the truth.

266
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:06,818
But not only the people, those who go to the jungles

267
00:23:06,938 --> 00:23:10,988
and those who renounce everything;

268
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:16,336
but there will be another type, the same people who are doing this,

269
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:23,749
who are doing this kind of seeking will, in the Kali Yuga

270
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:28,992
will take birth and will be normal householders,

271
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:33,939
and they’ll get into these illusions of every kind.

272
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,484
And at that time when they get into this illusion,

273
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:40,784
then only they will start seeking,

274
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:45,873
realizing that it is untruth, and they will seek the truth

275
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:48,140
at that time.

276
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:51,753
At that time only they will get their Self Realization.”

277
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:54,863
He told very clearly, I mean thousands of years back.

278
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:58,192
So Kali Yuga is the time

279
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,162
where people can get their Self Realization,

280
00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:04,902
they will know their Self, they will know the truth.

281
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:09,572
This is said long time back and you can see now it’s happening.

282
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,621
So this was the time meant for that,

283
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:16,481
because if you are all right like in Satya Yuga and all that,

284
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:21,086
so you don’t seek; you just accept, you are obedient,

285
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,930
you are good people – finished.

286
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,135
But in Kali Yuga you really start seeking the absolute truth,

287
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:34,378
and that is why these lights depict that character

288
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:38,479
or we can say that soul which are being enlightened.

289
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,458
So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that’s the Diwali.

290
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:48,109
If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwali:

291
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:52,017
that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga

292
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:57,824
and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga.

293
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:01,813
It’s very, very symbolic I should say,

294
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,152
that Diwali has already started.

295
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:09,750
We have many lights, and we have to get more lights,

296
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:16,033
not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights,

297
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:20,148
why do you want? Because all must be saved.

298
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:24,671
Our effort is to save everyone of them.

299
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,896
Very difficult, it’s very difficult.

300
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:32,107
But you can see now how like seeds realized souls go

301
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:35,683
and plant themselves in very far-fetched places

302
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:40,241
and there they prosper, become very beautiful trees,

303
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:45,908
fragrant, and which are giving shade to others.

304
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:50,080
That’s why you see people from all sorts of places

305
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,512
are being awakened and they become realized souls,

306
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:58,010
and they awaken others.

307
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,846
Is all the process it’s so well built in,

308
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:07,843
it looks like that and it’s working out well.

309
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:11,093
The only thing which is doubtful is,

310
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,603
how many will come to Sahaja Yoga,

311
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:17,138
and how many we can salvage and save?

312
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:21,639
Is the only problem and for that you should be prepared,

313
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,895
that every one of you should decide that

314
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:30,485
“I am going to save at least one soul every day,

315
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,773
one person every day.”

316
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:37,176
Supposing we are some, we have some people who are getting drowned,

317
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:43,588
say, in a river or in the sea. What do you do?

318
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,921
You all rush together to save.

319
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,737
You go all out to save his life.

320
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:52,320
In the same way we have to understand

321
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,346
we have to save the lives of all the people,

322
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,845
and for that we have to work very hard.

323
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:07,009
Now in this rising from illusion to truth also

324
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:14,516
we have certain problems which must be faced in a proper way.

325
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:18,546
One of the problems that arises out of this, as they say,

326
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:22,692
is the hunger. Hunger could be for money,

327
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:26,214
could be for food, could be for anything.

328
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:33,208
Now if there is a hunger for money

329
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:36,976
is going to settle [in] you permanently

330
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:43,064
because it is never satiable, you can never satisfy it.

331
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:50,210
But in the modern times people are just going mad, I tell you,

332
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,611
real mad for money.

333
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:58,009
They do not care whether others have it or not,

334
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:01,479
others have this convenience or not,

335
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,085
but just like to show off, they want to show off

336
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:07,393
– they’re very rich, they’re very good –

337
00:28:07,513 --> 00:28:10,744
and do all kinds of things with all their ego.

338
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:14,353
They think, “Nothing wrong; what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

339
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,562
This is one of the biggest hurdles you have,

340
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:22,424
is that your mind which is ego dictates,

341
00:28:22,544 --> 00:28:29,882
and you try to do it without even verifying

342
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:32,825
what is this, what is that.

343
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:38,979
So the mind is under bhranti, in illusion,

344
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,783
and then you have many ways to understand.

345
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:46,297
So I have said that in Sahaja Yoga

346
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:49,368
if they want they should get their Realization,

347
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:56,460
and also they can go about with their shoes anywhere they feel like,

348
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:59,830
specially on the day they get Realization.

349
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,762
It has worked wonders,

350
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,647
because that day you are in a stronger mood

351
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,156
and you avoid all wrong things.

352
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:10,809
Now so many of you have grown up in Sahaja Yoga

353
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,185
and are transformed completely.

354
00:29:13,305 --> 00:29:15,648
So very happy to see that.

355
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:19,794
I haven’t worked like… I have not done much, I don’t think;

356
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:23,848
I have just enlightened in a way, that’s very far-fetched,

357
00:29:23,968 --> 00:29:25,617
but I don’t do anything.

358
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:28,616
Without doing anything if you get enlightened and if you say,

359
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:32,167
“You have done it,” I can’t believe it. How can that be?

360
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:35,478
I didn’t do anything, just you got your Realization.

361
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:39,315
But now when I see, then I reflect

362
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:42,923
and find how beautifully you people sing,

363
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:47,641
how beautifully you have become sweet

364
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:52,808
and how beautifully you have become friendly to each other,

365
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:57,238
I am now convinced, and I feel this won’t take much time

366
00:29:57,358 --> 00:30:00,544
for you to establish Sahaja Yoga.

367
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:06,367
It is very high time that we should understand that

368
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:08,609
we have to expose ourselves

369
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:12,820
to Sahaja Yoga much more often than otherwise.

370
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:17,518
And you see the other problems are there also.

371
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:21,233
Like they have some problems, they are saying,

372
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:25,920
“Mother, there should be some written laws.” I said, “No.

373
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:30,085
It is through your experience also you can know.”

374
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:34,496
For example, the other day I said that there’s a Lakshmi Principle.

375
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:38,786
Now let us see how the Lakshmi Principle goes out.

376
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:45,437
Very simple, very easy if you want to know, it’s very simple.

377
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:53,170
Because this Lakshmi is very volatile, chancala [movable].

378
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,051
Once you give a hundred rupees to a servant,

379
00:30:57,171 --> 00:31:00,669
immediately he’ll go to the pub and drink :

380
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:04,408
the Lakshmi is dead; as soon as you give the Lakshmi,

381
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:08,369
he tries to go and drink in a pub.

382
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:12,519
So you can imagine what is the situation is with this Lakshmi.

383
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:16,774
She is very good but also She tempts you.

384
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,023
She tempts you very much.

385
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:23,929
So, you see, you have to watch: whatever money you have

386
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,667
you should put in the bank or do whatever you like,

387
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:31,473
but just don’t spend the whole lot. Just don’t do it.

388
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:37,591
Secondly you must know also, if all the doors are closed

389
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:43,439
and you get Lakshmi from one door She will stay, no doubt

390
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,778
She will stay; if you are miserly She will stay,

391
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:52,640
but She will rot because She has no outlet.

392
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:56,627
So if you open the other door, you will be amazed

393
00:31:56,747 --> 00:32:00,915
that not only this Lakshmi can go out

394
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:07,501
but also can get much more air, much more freedom from outside,

395
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,952
because you’ve opened the other door.

396
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:16,217
With one door you just experiment, nothing comes in it.

397
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:19,750
You open one door, no air will come, nothing will come in.

398
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,459
But you open the second door, then you will find

399
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:31,115
that there’s gushing of currents inside the room.

400
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:36,570
In the same way a person who wants to have money

401
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,144
should first learn to spend whatever money he has.

402
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:44,481
And in this Kali Yuga this is one of the blessings,

403
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:50,158
because the job of Kali Yuga is to create doubts,

404
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:52,890
to create illusions, bhramat

405
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,862
so it will go on creating. But if you stick on to the truth,

406
00:32:57,982 --> 00:33:03,371
then it won’t work out, it won’t work out.

407
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:07,940
So it is important to understand that all the time

408
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,973
we are under a testing ground.

409
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:16,043
It is a thing just to be witnessed.

410
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:20,708
It’s very interesting to see how this Lakshmi

411
00:33:20,828 --> 00:33:24,807
wants to run away from the house of a man

412
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:31,095
who is only interested in cheating,

413
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:37,231
interested in grabbing, in telling lies.

414
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:42,307
So this Lakshmi doesn’t stay with him. She goes away.

415
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:50,450
All these things are happening around us.

416
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:56,778
I am not saying this offhand, it’s all there – horrible!

417
00:33:56,999 --> 00:34:01,693
You see it’s to see, we have to clearly see

418
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:03,910
the movement of your mind.

419
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,270
Where is it going, where is it thinking?

420
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,339
Lakshmi is the One, She makes you think about some things

421
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,817
which you should not think.

422
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:16,649
As I told you people will start drinking,

423
00:34:16,769 --> 00:34:22,242
they will to go to races, they will drink a lot

424
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:25,081
– I mean they’ll do everything.

425
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:29,516
Why? Because they have money, now they must spend somewhere.

426
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:34,219
But they will put it into things which has no investment

427
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:42,045
in the real good, in the real achievement.

428
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:48,025
And that’s how we have now people who are spending so much money,

429
00:34:48,145 --> 00:34:52,126
so much on wasteful things.

430
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:56,773
So wastefulness can never, never

431
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,567
achieve the goal that is yours;

432
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:11,285
and the goal that is yours is the fulfillment of your being,

433
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:19,148
to become the Spirit. It’s very, very subtle to understand.

434
00:35:19,268 --> 00:35:22,220
You think you are doing nothing wrong; what’s that?

435
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,639
– after all, while I am doing something wrong

436
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:31,757
or something serious, the body should react. But no.

437
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:36,278
Nothing will react, neither your mind nor your body.

438
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:47,376
You see, all these years My experience has been very simple,

439
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:51,483
that there are some Sahaja Yogis still involved

440
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:54,238
in the Lakshmi Principle:

441
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,248
like they want to cheat Me,

442
00:35:58,368 --> 00:36:01,994
they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

443
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:06,157
Then there are some people who want to do business among themselves.

444
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:09,951
All of them have failed very badly,

445
00:36:10,071 --> 00:36:15,899
failed so badly that they are like bankrupts

446
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:19,161
or they are in jail, and all kinds of things.

447
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:25,148
So, never do business with a Sahaja Yogi.

448
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,647
For Sahaja Yogi it is very important

449
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:33,219
not to do any business with the Sahaja Yogis.

450
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,151
If you understand this simple principle

451
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:38,790
you will not do business with Sahaja Yoga.

452
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,433
Of course you can’t do business with Me also.

453
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:47,162
So this is a very, very simple thing in which people start doing.

454
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:50,301
For example they meet, two Sahaja Yogis:

455
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:57,933
one from say, from Japan, and another from say, America.

456
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,690
And they start saying, “Oh, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

457
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,361
I am also a Sahaja Yogi. Can you give me some, a false paper,

458
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:08,210
or you can give me some report?”

459
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,105
They go on asking you questions.

460
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:13,335
“But why? We don’t want. We don’t want to do that.”

461
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:16,041
They are not interested [in you?], they are interested

462
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:17,729
in what you have.

463
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:21,183
And this is something one has to learn

464
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:27,930
very cleverly and intelligently, when people start

465
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,787
communicating to you about the business part.

466
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:36,386
In Sahaja Yoga there is no business among themselves,

467
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:43,033
except they have business with Self Realization.

468
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,997
If you understand this point, small,

469
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:53,975
the money part of it which is quite illusive will disappear.

470
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:59,395
It all works out beautifully if you are surrendered,

471
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:04,665
but otherwise also it can be worked out,

472
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:07,261
even if you are not surrendered;

473
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:12,188
because you see the result and you are hurt,

474
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:16,433
you are troubled, and so you give it up.

475
00:38:17,235 --> 00:38:23,939
So whatever happens, it’s our watching system

476
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,188
– I should say, one of the chakras –

477
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:32,598
here you can see clearly: by watching.

478
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:37,012
Clearly you see how much you have gone into trouble,

479
00:38:37,132 --> 00:38:39,059
so you give it up.

480
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:42,706
But before doing that we have a very good way

481
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:48,498
of seeing through our vibrations.

482
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,504
You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself:

483
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:53,766
if the vibrations are good, well and good.

484
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:56,289
If they are not all right then should know

485
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,178
that there is something wrong.

486
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,653
You can judge any human being you like,

487
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:04,558
you can judge any pastor or if you want to see any one

488
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:08,936
of these millionaires and all those things,

489
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,062
but first you must find out:

490
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:20,924
that one, is he a perfect Sahaja Yogi or not?

491
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:25,587
This happens with the individuals.

492
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:28,392
It can happen in the collective also.

493
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,586
I have seen in the collective people are so much misled,

494
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:34,626
and one negative person immediately knows

495
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:39,283
who is the other negative, and then he gets hold of that negative

496
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:42,080
and they start working together.

497
00:39:42,906 --> 00:39:47,919
So you have to be extremely cautious

498
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,472
that you have got your Realization, you’ve got everything,

499
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:58,318
you’ve got also lot of money in Sahaja Yoga.

500
00:39:58,643 --> 00:40:01,299
With all that you should know

501
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:08,917
it’s a very, very good sign for thieves to walk in.

502
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:12,388
So you should be very careful

503
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:18,815
and don’t get charmed by all these nonsensical things.

504
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:22,851
That’s what is the protection from your Mother,

505
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:26,531
that She wants to protect you in this way.

506
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:36,435
Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness:

507
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:38,938
you see everything clearly.

508
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:44,823
Gradually this seeing will become so very sharp,

509
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:50,478
so clear-cut, so understanding that you will be amazed.

510
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:57,032
Then you will be using some thing there, anything you are using.

511
00:40:58,397 --> 00:41:01,066
Then you don’t have to think,

512
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:03,840
only you have to know the vibrations:

513
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,384
what are the vibrations are, what do the vibrations say,

514
00:41:07,504 --> 00:41:10,710
because they are there to guide you.

515
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:21,413
Those who are not yet very good at vibrations

516
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:24,437
should try to establish themselves.

517
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:26,262
If you are not good at vibrations

518
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,444
that means you will not judge people rightly,

519
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:31,535
nor will they have knowledge properly.

520
00:41:31,654 --> 00:41:35,719
So first you must get your, all your vibrations corrected

521
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,840
and also chakras corrected.

522
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:45,736
After that you can see what are your associates, who are they?

523
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:53,356
See actually, your mind now is so enlightened

524
00:41:53,476 --> 00:41:59,075
that you can straightforward see everything before you.

525
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:03,991
But if you don’t use that enlightened mind

526
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:09,358
you will be amazed, there are some forces of negativity,

527
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:12,653
and once these forces start

528
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:20,965
- You see, actually I should say we are at a juncture now

529
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:24,277
that these things won’t happen any more.

530
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:27,318
But when I started Sahaja Yoga it was very bad,

531
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:32,562
very bad situation, and we had half-baked,

532
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:42,200
quarter-baked, one-sixteenth-baked people [Laughs].

533
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,460
And I just didn’t know how to tell them,

534
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,473
because if I tell them anything they would just run away.

535
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,491
They would not come to Sahaja Yoga.

536
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,110
While in the other places like gurus, what they do,

537
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,902
they take money and – “bas” (enough), that’s all.

538
00:42:58,022 --> 00:43:00,896
Now people think: ”Now we have given money to the guru,

539
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:04,630
how can we leave?” Maybe they go on giving money and sticking on.

540
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,206
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s no money involved.

541
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:11,087
So they come, then they disappear.

542
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,397
Very common; it’s very, very common

543
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:16,391
that they come for a short time to Sahaja Yoga.

544
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:21,155
But if they are really special people they just stick,

545
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:25,398
and start seeing everything from the right angle

546
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:29,561
because they are enlightened,

547
00:43:29,681 --> 00:43:33,208
they have grown up, they are mature.

548
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:35,791
So this is how we have to come back

549
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:42,517
to this horrible night of Kali Yuga through Diwali.

550
00:43:42,637 --> 00:43:44,838
This is what we have to do,

551
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:51,067
to be humble and to find whether you are all right or not,

552
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:54,971
whether you are going in the right direction or not.

553
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,132
It is you only who can decide.

554
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:02,556
With vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching,

555
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,711
or you will know you are right.

556
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:06,722
Whatever decision has to be taken,

557
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:11,120
you have to use your hands fully.

558
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:15,531
It’s not talking that is going to help,

559
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:20,241
it’s not giving lectures that is going to help – no.

560
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:30,833
It is through experimenting, through understanding,

561
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:41,382
through the feelings or the deep, I should say the deep impact

562
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:46,069
of everything that will communicate to you

563
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:49,196
what sort of a people they are, what they are talking about,

564
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:50,934
what you should do.

565
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:53,445
This could be a little mental,

566
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:58,974
but later on it becomes absolutely beyond the mental activity.

567
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:08,719
Now as it is, I said that Kali Yuga is over,

568
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,414
is about to finish.

569
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:15,688
But still there may be people who will try to go back

570
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:19,766
to this kind of normalcy, so-called.

571
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:25,397
But there is a way out for all this, is simple meditation.

572
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:32,809
With meditation you can achieve whatever is to be achieved,

573
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:38,270
and then you’ll be surprised that we have been given

574
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:43,582
very, very important thing to be done.

575
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:48,192
And the most important thing is to be watchful about yourself,

576
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:52,649
that I hope you are not falling into the trap of Lakshmi.

577
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:58,273
The same Lakshmi that decorates you can also disfigure you.

578
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:04,559
So we have to do everything to keep this beautiful Lakshmi,

579
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:10,532
this decorated Lakshmi as our ideal, and it works out.

580
00:46:13,421 --> 00:46:21,081
Our aim is this, our ideal is this and we have to do this,

581
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:28,870
so we can establish the new government, very beautiful government.

582
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:41,188
Our whole attitude should be such that we have to be alert,

583
00:46:41,308 --> 00:46:43,688
because you become meditative.

584
00:46:43,808 --> 00:46:47,192
As soon as you start thinking about something

585
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:51,622
you’ll become meditative. Your thinking will go away.

586
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:56,429
You won’t be able to think, and then you can be lost?

587
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:02,496
But no, when you are meditative then you cannot be lost. Why?

588
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:10,443
Because then you have given your life in the hands of truth.

589
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:16,013
You have given your hand into the hand of reality

590
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,537
and that guides you, that protects you, that watches…

591
00:47:19,657 --> 00:47:23,297
that watches you, that helps you – you can never go wrong.

592
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:25,595
Even if you are meditative

593
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:28,117
don’t you worry, nothing will happen to you.

594
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:34,239
But if you are never meditative, then it’s impossible to save.

595
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:38,309
It’s impossible to save, it’s impossible to mature;

596
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:43,571
you have to be very meditative to mature. That’s very important.

597
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:48,404
I would say that all the Sahaja Yogis here today

598
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:53,058
are doing this puja, and then there will be also

599
00:47:53,178 --> 00:47:58,376
another puja of enlightenment I have been called, or whatever it is;

600
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:02,656
but you have to be very, very careful

601
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:06,116
not to renounce your meditative mood.

602
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:09,584
What you can do is to watch

603
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:14,736
how far you have gone, how far you have solved your problems.

604
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:16,482
As soon as you see that,

605
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:21,939
immediately you become a complete realized soul.

606
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:27,488
So the guideline is such that

607
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:31,870
we should know that we are realized souls.

608
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,509
And what is so important?

609
00:48:34,629 --> 00:48:39,973
Why have we become realized souls? Not only for our desires,

610
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:43,249
for our pure desires but also for others.

611
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:46,146
And in that understanding

612
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:50,036
that we are not only for ourselves but for others,

613
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,210
you become collectively conscious,

614
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,603
and you start helping others.

615
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,352
You’ll stand very well;

616
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:02,261
otherwise you are lost and the others are also lost.

617
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:07,266
This way is the way we have to really go ahead,

618
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:09,603
go ahead towards the truth

619
00:49:09,723 --> 00:49:12,431
and bring that truth for the other people,

620
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,852
for other people, and save them.

621
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:22,004
This is how you can express your love to them, all your caring.

622
00:49:27,812 --> 00:49:35,080
It is a subject which is very difficult to handle, I think,

623
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:43,685
because of – I should say that to talk about this subject

624
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:48,896
is much easier than to assimilate this within ourselves.

625
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:51,045
So now when you are listening to Me,

626
00:49:51,165 --> 00:49:54,918
please try that you have to meditate afterwards.

627
00:49:55,038 --> 00:49:58,281
In meditation you will assimilate,

628
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:03,363
and the same power that you think is within you

629
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:07,164
of discrimination, of giving vibrations,

630
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:09,769
of doing all kinds of things out of Sahaja Yoga

631
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:13,669
will be completely, continuously be acting.

632
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:20,389
But if you do not meditate, if you are somewhere else,

633
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:23,586
it won’t work out. It won’t work out.

634
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,439
So today is the day to celebrate

635
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,291
and to be happy that we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over,

636
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:32,283
there is hope for the whole world,

637
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:37,687
and we can save all people who are lost in the wilderness.

638
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:39,642
That’s a fact, no doubt.

639
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,765
But after that celebration and everything

640
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:48,310
we should sit back on the, we can call, on the asanam or anywhere

641
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,381
and watch what is happening;

642
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:54,906
and you will be amazed that in meditation

643
00:50:55,026 --> 00:50:59,234
you will be revealed with all the beauties you have achieved,

644
00:50:59,354 --> 00:51:02,269
all kinds of things that you have achieved.

645
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:07,823
And all the worries and botherations of things disappear.

646
00:51:07,943 --> 00:51:10,390
This should happen to you all,

647
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,392
and this is what I request you all to have

648
00:51:14,512 --> 00:51:21,242
this special capacity to understand yourself.

649
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:29,201
My own hope is fulfilled.

650
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:36,621
To see you sitting down here I feel overjoyed,

651
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:40,396
and same way you will also feel

652
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:48,048
when you all will try to raise the Kundalini of others,

653
00:51:48,168 --> 00:51:50,551
establish them in Sahaja Yoga

654
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:53,086
– to be amazed what will happen to you.

655
00:51:53,206 --> 00:51:57,549
It’s so joyous to give Realizations to others.

656
00:51:57,669 --> 00:51:59,679
For that you don’t have to do anything,

657
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:01,937
to pay anything, nothing of the kind;

658
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:05,142
this power you have which is awakened, that’s all.

659
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:06,941
I mean, what you have to do is to,

660
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:09,895
wherever you go you have to just awaken the Kundalini

661
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:12,658
of the person, give Realization.

662
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:17,746
Nothing needs to be done. And that’s so joy-giving,

663
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:20,201
you feel so happy about it.

664
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:24,711
So today I bless you all with this special power

665
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,834
that you give Realization to people

666
00:52:27,954 --> 00:52:32,729
and look after the Nabhi of the people, and whatever it is.

667
00:52:34,134 --> 00:52:41,363
It is very, very important to understand how far you can go.

668
00:52:41,918 --> 00:52:45,908
We have to change the world, we have to save the world.

669
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:48,538
It’s your responsibility.

670
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:52,677
You have got Realization, not the others,

671
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,612
so don’t try to find faults with others.

672
00:52:55,732 --> 00:52:59,307
Think about you, that you have Realization

673
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:06,240
and it is expected that you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

674
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:10,758
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

675
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:14,519
Today, I’m getting so meditative that I don’t know!

676
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:22,445
May God bless you all.
