1
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,277
Now then there we have another center
on top,

2
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:26,701
which we call as the Heart Center.
It is in the center.

3
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,496
Now in the sternum bone, behind the sternum
bone this center is there,

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:36,215
and thymus produces the antibodies
in your sternum bone.

5
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:40,801
These antibodies later on fight your
diseases.

6
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:44,410
When you are about twelve years of age
they go into the whole body,

7
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:51,965
and waiting there for a signal from
your sternum bone.

8
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:54,355
That means supposing you see something,
you get frightened,

9
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,418
this bone starts pulsating.

10
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,832
When it pulsates the antibodies know
there’s some emergency,

11
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,160
and they get prepared for it.

12
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,658
Now this is such a normal thing to happen
to people,

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,512
but the insecurities can be of the worst
type,

14
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:13,051
and when these insecurities develop,

15
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:16,113
people can develop all kinds of diseases
of the lungs;

16
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:20,465
specially the women develop what you call
as the breast cancer.

17
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,176
Mostly these women are insecured: maybe
their husbands are not good,

18
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:28,098
or they feel that the husband may leave
them alone or something like that.

19
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,026
There are certain insecurities that are
built in.

20
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,199
They might be quite frightened
personalities.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,330
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

22
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,426
have this Center Heart catching,

23
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:41,379
because they are afraid they may miss
the plane or I don’t know,

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,183
they have to be on the job and run and do.

25
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:46,993
Mostly these time-bound jobs

26
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:50,574
cause you a trouble here of the Center
Heart,

27
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:53,238
and this Center Heart is very important,

28
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,183
because for women specially they have
to be secured.

29
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,465
If their motherhood is challenged then
they are even worse.

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:02,933
And this is how one has to understand,
a woman should be

31
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:07,683
very much respected if she is your wife,
she’s your child or anything,

32
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,113
she has to be respected and given
all the security.

33
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:15,113
It’s the woman who makes the society,
is the woman who creates the children,

34
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,387
is the woman who looks after the children.

35
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:22,729
So the men have to give all the security
and the protection to the womenhood

36
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,832
and understand that it is a very important
factor,

37
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,535
which if we neglect we can have lots
of problems with our society;

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,066
and the women will start competing with men

39
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,761
and then the society will be all
dislocated.

40
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:48,214
If there’s any problem with your father,
then the right side catches

41
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,847
and it gives you asthma.

42
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:54,079
First of all you are, we can say,
vulnerable to asthma,

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,557
due to bad liver. Plus if you have problems

44
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:01,109
with your father or if with your fatherhood –
supposing you are an unhappy father,

45
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,972
or maybe that you are not looking after
your children,

46
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:06,901
then you get this center caught up
very badly.

47
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,262
It can happen to any one of us, if a man
is unkind to his son,

48
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:14,231
is the father principle.

49
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:19,255
If the son is unkind to the father, so
the father is hurt,

50
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:23,770
is the father principle - if it is
disturbed by any chance,

51
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:30,044
or if suddenly father dies and you feel
the pinch of that all your life,

52
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:34,559
all that can work out here, and you get
this Right Heart catch,

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,083
with that you get asthma.

54
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:41,512
It is said that in homeopathy they believe
that with more tension you get it,

55
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:45,184
because when you are more tense, you see,
you remember your father,

56
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,106
if he was here he would have helped you.

57
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:49,307
In the subconscious sometimes it works out

58
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:53,543
and that’s how it adds to the problem.

59
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:58,733
It is so simple to work out, that you’ll
be amazed

60
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:04,919
that if you have to just raise the
principle of father in a person like that,

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,380
who might be a dejected father, who
might be a cruel father,

62
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,762
who might be a son who has lost a father,
can be anything,

63
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,995
that you have to just put your hand
on that part.

64
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:33,567
On the left hand side of this, is
the essence of motherhood.

65
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,775
If in your childhood

66
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:45,454
your mother had played a role which
has given you fear,

67
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:51,540
or kind of a frightening experience, then
this center goes out,

68
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:55,134
we say the Left Heart is catching.

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,840
Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also,
it might catch.

70
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:08,556
This center is very important. On the left
hand side is the mother’s side,

71
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,398
and the mother itself, if the mother is a lunatic, you get a problem there.

72
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,494
You might get it, we call it a Heart:

73
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,663
there are two Hearts, one is the Heart
of the Spirit

74
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:20,595
and one is the Heart Chakra.

75
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:26,158
If a mother is a fanatic, she is a woman
who is very fanatic about her food,

76
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,728
things like that, then the children get it.

77
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,736
It’s a dangerous thing to play with
children like that,

78
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:35,595
to have complete discipline on the children
and just keep them,

79
00:05:35,796 --> 00:05:38,884
“Must walk straight like a horse, put
two things and...”

80
00:05:39,124 --> 00:05:41,205
Children should be allowed to have
their freedom.

81
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:44,774
Actually, when we suppress them too much,
they become hooligans.

82
00:05:44,975 --> 00:05:47,914
That way Indians are better, they know
how to bring up their children.

83
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:52,752
With this cruelty towards children, I don’t
know what women are up to.

84
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,859
Where are they going to take their figures

85
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,306
and their beauties and everything?
In front of God?

86
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:05,611
Such cruelty exists, such
self-centeredness!

87
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:08,387
Then, with all, this the children develop
this trouble

88
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:12,998
and they have palpitations. They have
very weak hearts.

89
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:16,906
Or when the children

90
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,166
are not nice to the mother, they
also get it.

91
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:23,783
So mother and father are very important
factors in Sahaja Yoga,

92
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:29,022
and you have to understand that if your
parents have been unkind to you,

93
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,696
you must forgive them. Just forget
about them -

94
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:34,327
because they have given you birth -
you should be thankful,

95
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,212
and just forget about them. That’s
the best way

96
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:40,820
to get over the problem of Left
and Right Heart.

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,648
So I have explained to you all these
things, now this is the heart.

98
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,453
In the heart resides the Spirit.

99
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,890
The Spirit is watching the game of this
creation,

100
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:08,804
and is watching what is happening to this
person,

101
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,757
to this person, to this person, to this
person.

102
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:21,467
Everybody has got in their heart
the Spirit, which is watching.

103
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:26,296
It’s called as the Kshetragnya, means
the One, the Knower of the field.

104
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:30,249
He is watching you, every minute.
He knows what you do,

105
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,678
where you go, what mistakes you create,
He watches, He doesn’t interfere.

106
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,242
Is only the interference comes from here,
from that area,

107
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:45,968
which tries to give you a conscience,
which tries to improve you.

108
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,614
From here sometimes, the wisdom part,

109
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:51,966
which tries to tell you ‘be in the center’,
by punishing you,

110
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,788
by showing it is wrong.

111
00:07:54,989 --> 00:08:01,093
But He is just watching the game,
“Let’s see how far it goes”.

112
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:05,453
He is the Knower of your field.

113
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:09,484
He is the Universal Being within you.

114
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:16,305
He is the reflection of that God Almighty
who is a Spectator within you.

115
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,285
And His power is this all-pervading power

116
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,879
which has created all this.

117
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,288
So, to feel this all-pervading power,

118
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,805
you have to become the Spirit.

119
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:36,470
All this creation has no meaning if you
do not become the Spirit.

120
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:41,337
In the Vedas, the first, the very first
stanza says

121
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:45,337
that by reading Vedas if you do not
become vid –

122
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:49,618
vid means, Veda word comes from vida,
vida means to know –

123
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:54,360
if you do not become the knowledge, then
it has no meaning.

124
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,226
Shri Mataji: What’s the question?

125
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:59,181
Seeker: You were talking about the Spirit

126
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:03,220
being in the Heart chakra there, over
on the left side.

127
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,752
I’d like to know why it’s on the left
instead of in the middle,

128
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,744
because if the Spirit – it has to do
with Realization –

129
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:12,323
why isn’t it in the middle in the central
Kundalini,

130
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:16,531
instead of on the other side like that,
and why is it… and why in…

131
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,229
Shri Mataji: …the heart.
Seeker: Yeah.

132
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,006
Shri Mataji: Heart is the main thing
within us, you see;

133
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:25,244
that’s the last. Once heart stops, we
don’t exist:

134
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,022
it’s sheer existence.

135
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:32,405
That’s the most important organ that
God has given us.

136
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:40,718
Once the Spirit is angry, in any
way strained, any way despaired,

137
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,250
He just disappears, and then we die;
there’s nothing left.

138
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,283
Heart is very important, that’s why
He's placed there.
