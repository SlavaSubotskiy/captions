1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,834
Also we can take without the …,

2
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,625
one of My body and face, because without the …

3
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,792
You see, you don’t have any,

4
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,458
very few photographs without this.

5
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,083
I haven’t seen any one of your recent photographs.

6
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,583
And you are famous, all over the world!

7
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,000
They call it as ….

8
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:14,625
Well done. Good.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,417
The rain’s stopped,

10
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:37,917
everything is all right.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,667
All Bhairava’s work.

12
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,417
So, firstly we have to give the leaders, so just...

13
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,834
Everything.

14
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,125
I can have it after lunch, not just now.

15
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,875
I think first of all you get out the saris.

16
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,417
What’s that?

17
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,417
Wah wah! Very good.

18
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,041
You all have written the names, so I will see them Myself.

19
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,667
Who did that come from? All right.

20
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,291
Who is Kabir? All right.

21
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,333
Tegan, who’s that? Good.

22
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:11,792
Anya, which one is she? Oh, she’s done very nicely.

23
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,417
Very good. And who’s this one?

24
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,083
Who has done this one?

25
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,375
Justin. Who is Justin? Thank you very much.

26
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,291
I think you’d better distribute the prasad.

27
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,709
Wah wah! … Apron, apron.

28
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,875
A beautiful one! Very sweet now.

29
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,250
You see, when I’m cooking I can wear this one, all right?

30
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,917
Very well done!

31
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,667
What do you want Me to cook for you?

32
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,458
Beautiful! All right.

33
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,709
First give those sweets and things, and chocolates …

34
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,000
What’s that? You made it?

35
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,875
Good. Thank you.

36
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,083
From yoghurt?

37
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,625
Oh, beautiful!

38
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,333
From where did you get them?

39
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,208
From the beach?

40
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:49,166
Beautiful, really very beautiful.

41
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,792
Beautifully made, eh? Very nice! She’s an artist …

42
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,959
This is the kind of Ganesha was standing behind Me.

43
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,083
See that photograph?

44
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,792
Exactly like that. You have seen it?

45
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,667
Without seeing, you have done – great!

46
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,375
You must see that photograph.

47
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,834
Oh, very sweet of you.

48
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,333
Thank you very much, thank you.

49
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,166
Thank you, Bhairava. … A little bit, eh? …

50
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,959
Thank you. Thank you. …

51
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,500
You couldn’t bear My purse, eh?

52
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:09,125
Oh, what a purse! Is it made here?

53
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,625
What a beauty! Beautiful, very good.

54
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,875
Very artistic, eh? …

55
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,999
Why did they use these colors?

56
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,125
Most artistic – nature and all …

57
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,333
What a beauty it is!

58
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,250
Thank you very much. It’s a special thing,

59
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,083
called something special?

60
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,959
Thank you very much.

61
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you doing, all the time giving presents to Me?

62
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,125
You have given Me eggs, this, that – now, what more?

63
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,458
The purse is an idea, because it should help Me:

64
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,083
in India they can paint all this, but they don’t have ideas.

65
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,750
You are very artistic people here,

66
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,917
I must say, very artistic, because of the nature.

67
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,125
What’s that?

68
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,208
Oh! No wonder I wore a...

69
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,875
It’s wonderful!

70
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:19,125
Beautiful.

71
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,750
You know how to choose present for the birthday of Christ!

72
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,667
And what is this one is, porcelain?

73
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:36,000
Plaster. We have to be careful.

74
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,917
Better be careful.

75
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:46,458
It’s an old thing, is it?

76
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,208
You can see the face.

77
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,333
But maybe it’s a porcelain?

78
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,667
Be careful, I mean, you have to really.

79
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:02,291
Beautifully done! See her cloth, the red and the blue;

80
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,875
and see, I’m wearing the same combination.

81
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,625
But you have to be a little careful of it, it’s all right.

82
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,667
Beautiful!

83
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,250
The rain disappeared.

84
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,417
I just meditated on it.

85
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,999
I meditated for one minute, and it disappeared.

86
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,917
But this Bhairava is terrible,

87
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,625
He would not allow Me to speak! Just pulling Me down.

88
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,125
But I managed it. It’s quite a nice lecture, you know.

89
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,083
If it’s taped give Me a copy, and send it to her.

90
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:51,041
Very good lecture. I’ve never spoken about Bhairavanath.

91
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:55,166
Make a copy, it will be a good present.

92
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:02,000
Before I go if you can give the copy, it will be a good idea.

93
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,625
And some chana also.

94
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:16,041
Like children, I also love chana. And popcorn!

95
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,500
They are all enjoying. You love popcorn only, do you?

96
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,250
You don’t like this?

97
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,917
I think better distribute, otherwise it will be left out.

98
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,041
You like chana?

99
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,792
Give to children. Better take the cake around …

100
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,208
No, this I don’t eat, I’m sorry: it’s rather sour, isn’t it?

101
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,834
For children, nothing’s sour!

102
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,125
Beautiful!

103
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,999
Einstein’s theory ... Boomerang.

104
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,875
It’s the theory of Einstein; you see, he has used this ...

105
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,333
According to him, the light doesn’t travel

106
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,083
in a straight line but …

107
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,583
That’s why it reflects. It boomerangs. …

108
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,458
A yogi asks about a cure for a possession.

109
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,125
It’s some sort of a possession.

110
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,834
Maybe you use the light. Light will help a lot.

111
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,041
You’ve been to some guru or someone?

112
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,834
Who said?

113
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,542
No, no, it can be removed with Sahaja Yoga, anything.

114
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,291
It’s not like permanently with Sahaja Yoga.

115
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:58,458
Every kinds of curse can be removed, family or anything.

116
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,834
It’s for a teenage girl, you see, this one! It’s so beautiful.

117
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,834
Give it more to the children there.

118
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,667
Take all the chana.

119
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,458
They’re the realized souls now. …

120
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:37,500
You wanted Me to talk about children and all that, is it  here?

121
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,166
Should I say some few words?

122
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,875
Everywhere I have to say – all right!

123
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,375
So now we have talked about Bhairava and

124
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,250
we have seen how negativity acts within us,

125
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,333
and how we get caught up.

126
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:44,208
So,

127
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:50,166
I would say that, we must always keep in mind,

128
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,333
that we have a soul

129
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,083
and that soul can be attacked.

130
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:58,166
It has been already attacked when with all

131
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,375
the kinds of things we have had in these modern lives,

132
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,000
it's already under attack.

133
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,166
But now we have to cleanse it, and put it right.

134
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:10,041
If you really want to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and cleanse yourself

135
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,041
then you have to understand that we need lot of introspection

136
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,250
- lot of introspection.

137
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,250
Now the people who are left-sided are sort of,

138
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,208
they are not straightforward

139
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,333
and they are sly and they talk ill about others.

140
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,083
Last time I discovered that in Perth

141
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:32,166
there was a lot of things people were talking and,

142
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I wanted to remind you again that I heard about it,

143
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,375
also that even now in Australia

144
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,166
that kind of people are still there,

145
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,166
who just start at the back saying things.

146
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,125
One person says something, another listens to it

147
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,083
and it's very very bad thing,

148
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,083
because talking ill about others means you first of all

149
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,083
you get the ill within you.

150
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,166
The second thing is that the way you propagate

151
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,250
you stop Divinity spreading out.

152
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,208
Thirdly you grow into negativity yourself

153
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:08,000
and to whomsoever you talk that person also gets infected,

154
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,208
it's like a disease.

155
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,208
So I think in Australia throughout we have to be very careful

156
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:17,166
because we have had two big somersaults you can say,

157
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:21,041
with big falling because of this only,

158
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,083
that secretly, and this is a side,

159
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,083
I would say Australia is very left-sided

160
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:30,083
otherwise also because Ganesha's place.

161
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,125
That's why Ganesha was placed here,

162
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,375
to save you and to put you right

163
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,250
as far as the left side is concerned.

164
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,250
And we have to be very cautious

165
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,208
because that temperament develops,

166
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:44,125
you know, depend on.

167
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,333
Like also it is in England quite a lot,

168
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,166
but say not in America, say not in Austria,

169
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,291
not in Russia, Germany,

170
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,166
they are on the contrary open and they can be aggressive,

171
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:58,375
but they are not sly.

172
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,208
So either you are aggressive or you are sly.

173
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,041
Accordingly you must find out within yourself

174
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:07,083
what's wrong with you and where are we wrong.

175
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,041
Because after all we are Sahaja Yogis,

176
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,375
it's a great chance we have got

177
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,208
that we have got our Realization,

178
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,208
and that now we have reached a stage where we really

179
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,208
are placed in the Kingdom of God.

180
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,375
But now how far you go into it depends only on you.

181
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,000
Now Russia why we were successful

182
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
because people are very introspective.

183
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,208
If you read any book of Russian writers

184
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,208
like Tolstoy or anyone,

185
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:36,291
anything they do, say even when they fall in love or anything,

186
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,291
immediately they start introspecting:

187
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,333
'Why, why am I falling in love?

188
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,291
Why this happening to me?

189
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,291
Why I'm thinking like that? Why I'm doing like that?'

190
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,125
You see they introspect,

191
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,250
and that introspection if we do not have within ourselves

192
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,166
then, what happens that we can go

193
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,208
either to the right or to the left.

194
00:27:56,208 --> 00:28:00,291
But in this country I see it's more the left side,

195
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,291
sly things are there.

196
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,083
Now how all this has happened that

197
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:09,333
we had some horrible leaders,

198
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,250
agreed and instead of talking about it

199
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,291
or telling Me about it,

200
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:19,000
they all just started talking among themselves and all that

201
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,208
and they got all their bad qualities

202
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,250
sort of combined within themselves

203
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,291
and that's how so many lost their vibrations

204
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:29,375
and lost their, what should I say,

205
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,125
the searching power.

206
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,083
So when you see a person,

207
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,333
or anyone who is doing wrong,

208
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,208
better is to forget about it.

209
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:46,041
Or if you don't forget then you should write to Me,

210
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,041
even if you don't do that

211
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,041
better go and talk to that person on his face

212
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:53,041
that: 'I think this is not right.'

213
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,375
But if you write to Me it can be solved,

214
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,166
problem can be solved.

215
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:01,041
Say now you have one Mr X as your leader

216
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,166
or anybody here who is

217
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,000
coming say,

218
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,125
from New Zealand,

219
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,083
or someone from outside.

220
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,333
Immediately you should find out,

221
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
are you critical of him?

222
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,333
What are you looking at that person?

223
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:20,125
What are you trying to find out about that person?

224
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:25,125
If you are critical then know that you can never progress.

225
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,166
You should be critical about yourself,

226
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:31,083
not about others,

227
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,166
know that you are most imperfect,

228
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,333
that's the best way.

229
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,291
Like we had a child about nine year old,

230
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,375
and he was extremely sly type

231
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,250
and,

232
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,166
he was talking ill like this of this person to that person and

233
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,291
he would go and just jump on to someone,

234
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,125
and hit someone, secretly.

235
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,250
Not openly.

236
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,333
So I called the child and I asked him:

237
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,125
'What do you think of yourself?

238
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,250
Do you think you are the most perfect person?'

239
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,333
He said: 'Yes, I do'

240
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,125
I said: 'That's it.

241
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,166
It's finished.'

242
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,208
Such a person cannot improve.

243
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,000
So when you try to find faults with others

244
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,375
know that we have too many faults ourselves.

245
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,166
Not to feel guilty - of course, that point is there also.

246
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,166
You should never feel guilty about it.

247
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,250
If you have faults just see:

248
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,041
"What faults do I have?

249
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,208
How will I correct?

250
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,041
What chakras I am catching?"

251
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,333
Instead of seeing the chakras of others,

252
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,250
if you see your own, then you'll become purified,

253
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,125
you'll be very clean, you'll be wonderful,

254
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,041
everything will be fine.

255
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:44,083
But if you cannot see your own faults,

256
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:48,375
that means you haven't yet got your Self-Realization.

257
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,166
Self-Realization means to know about your Self,

258
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:55,375
and this - the last time I did say all these things here in Perth

259
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,250
and also otherwise, that if you

260
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,333
talk about somebody like that to spread stories.

261
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,417
Ladies specially should be careful

262
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:05,083
because they are on the left,

263
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,000
they have to be very, very careful,

264
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
that they start judging others.

265
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They think they are perfect, they judge,

266
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
they tell their husbands,

267
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,250
then husband tells another husband,

268
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,166
then husband tells his wife - it spreads.

269
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:19,333
You have to be extremely wise and sensible women.

270
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,041
If you are not sensible this will spread like a disease.

271
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:29,000
In Sahaja Yoga this is one of the diseases I dread,

272
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,166
is what Christ has called: "Murmuring souls."

273
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:35,208
He said: "Beware of the murmuring souls!"

274
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,208
Leaders are also afraid to tell you something.

275
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:41,208
If they tell you something immediately you'll start saying

276
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,291
"Oh, Mother said so -he's saying so."

277
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,208
Whatever the leader is saying you must listen to him,

278
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,250
must obey him, ask him

279
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,041
what does he mean by saying this, what is it?

280
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:54,291
Now in case you find something wrong with the leader

281
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,166
you are all free to write to Me,

282
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,041
and I will definitely go into it,

283
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,083
for example, Stephen wrote to Me about someone

284
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,000
and I went into this,

285
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,125
enquired and found out what was the thing.

286
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,083
You see so there's no harm,

287
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,250
in finding out about someone.

288
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,291
Some lady wrote to Me also and I found it.

289
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:16,166
So but unnecessarily paying attention to another person

290
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,000
is not a good thing.

291
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,250
Paying attention to yourself

292
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,250
and looking all the good points of another person,

293
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,125
of helping another person,

294
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,166
that's how we would be collective,

295
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:28,083
we'll be growing faster

296
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,000
and we'll be enjoying ourselves.

297
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Now our children are here.

298
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:37,333
Now, what I find that we do not know really

299
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:42,208
what are the balanced ways of looking after our children.

300
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:45,291
So some think that when I said they are realized souls,

301
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,041
so they said, "All right, let them do what they like."

302
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,125
It's not true, otherwise if that is so

303
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,125
they would have been born out of the trees, you see.

304
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,041
Why are they born out of you?

305
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,291
So you have a responsibility

306
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,375
whether they are realized or not.

307
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,375
You have a responsibility about your children

308
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,208
and you have to see that you correct them.

309
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,083
It's very important.

310
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:11,000
Some people I've seen allow their children

311
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,250
to go just so mad and so, they go so amok.

312
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,208
In this I would say an Indian parent is an ideal parent.

313
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,125
What he will do, he looks after the child.

314
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,166
Also, in a way he loves,

315
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,083
expresses his love and all that,

316
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,375
but if he finds anything wrong with the child

317
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:35,166
immediately he'll correct - immediately,

318
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:38,083
not spare him, in the presence of others.

319
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,375
Now, if another person comes and tells about the child,

320
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,083
that this child has done,

321
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:46,125
immediately he will scold the child.

322
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,125
He will never get angry with the another person:

323
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,083
"Why did you say about my child now?"

324
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,250
But thank him and that "Thank God you have told me";

325
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,250
because he might be spoiled more.

326
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,375
Like I'll tell you we had one Avadhut

327
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,375
- now he's a grown up boy, but when he was young,

328
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,333
one day he asked Me that,

329
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,125
"If you leave your parents their,

330
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:10,166
the baddhas of your parents they leave you or not?"

331
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:13,125
I said: 'No, they may not leave, the baddhas of your parents.

332
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:15,208
Then what's the use of leaving the parents?'

333
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,041
"But," I said: 'Who is leaving parents?"

334
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:20,041
"No," he said: "I've heard that in the Western countries,

335
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,250
people, children leave their parents

336
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,125
when they are eighteen years of age.

337
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,208
But I would not like to leave the parents."

338
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,083
"I said: "Why? You can be free."

339
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,291
He said: "Then, I'll be free to do wrong.

340
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,208
Who will correct me?

341
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,166
If I take the cigarette in my hand,

342
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,333
who will correct me?

343
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,125
Who will tell me: "Don't do it."

344
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,375
I mean if a child takes a cigarette in the hand,

345
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:42,333
immediately the father will take the cigarette

346
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and burn it, also.

347
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,291
And: "Next time I see you I'll burn your tongue."

348
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,000
Finished.

349
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:55,041
But, the child knows that, "The father loves me

350
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,041
and loves me in such a way

351
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,083
that I should not lose my father",

352
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,041
but he must know that he can lose,

353
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,041
the kindness of the father.

354
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,041
If you allow the child just all the time

355
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:10,166
to behave the way he likes, or it likes,

356
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,333
then it will sit on your head.

357
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,166
And today only I was discussing with him

358
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:18,208
and I told him that I was traveling one day with one lady

359
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,041
in the train, one of the Sahaja Yoginis,

360
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,208
and her child was there, not very old,

361
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,333
must have been about seven years of age.

362
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,125
She was trying to talk to Me and this fellow

363
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:31,375
was all the time: "Mummy, mummy,"

364
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:35,083
and then: "Why? Why?" was going on,

365
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,291
you see, all the time.

366
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:40,291
I told her: "Why must you answer all his questions?"

367
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,166
I said: "He is just making enquiries."

368
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:46,291
I said, "Nothing sensible enquiries, just it's nosense.

369
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:48,250
He wants to attract your attention."

370
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,083
So why do you want to pay so much attention to him?

371
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,208
So she said: "Mother, how to stop it?"

372
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,125
I said: "I'll stop it in one minute."

373
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,333
I said, I asked him:

374
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,333
"You should not ask so many questions."

375
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,291
So he said: "Why?"

376
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,125
"Because", I said, "you are stupid.

377
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,375
You have to learn a lot, still

378
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,333
and if you go on asking question like this

379
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,125
you'll be very, very stupid

380
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,041
and one day you'll have to go like a madman.

381
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,333
Do you want to become a madman?"

382
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,208
He got a fright of his life.

383
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,250
"You'll become mad."

384
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,083
And you see if you any of your children are there

385
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:24,125
you have to tell them some stories. I'll tell you how.

386
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:27,125
Some children have a habit of beating others

387
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,041
or doing something, then you said,

388
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:34,083
"Now if you beat then a tail comes out of your bottom,

389
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,333
like that you see like a doggy and something like that."

390
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,000
And they believe it. They believe it.

391
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:44,333
Next day they'll ask: "Is there a tail coming out?"

392
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,208
"Ya maybe, maybe."

393
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:51,083
So now you are going to behave: "Ya I'll be very..."

394
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,041
You see all these tricks have to be played to your children

395
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,208
but they're very clever

396
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,250
and they know how to make you dance,

397
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,250
you see how to make you

398
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:06,208
- their sort of slaves, sometimes, you may call

399
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:09,000
for everything they will demand: "Do this, do this."

400
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now because they're Realized souls

401
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,041
I was surprised that when I went to London you see

402
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,208
I read in the newspaper the statistics about children

403
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,333
that every week in London City only,

404
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,375
two children are killed by parents.

405
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,291
I mean that was too much for Me.

406
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,166
So I just blasted all of them and I said:

407
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,125
"Nothing doing, you must love your children."

408
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:32,166
As a result all the children sat on their heads, you see

409
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,291
and they couldn't come to the programs.

410
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,250
If they came to the programs they were,

411
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,000
the children were to be kept outside like doggies,

412
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,333
tied together something and in England I don't know,

413
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,333
maybe here also, they do have a leash, just like a dog.

414
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,208
You see they hold the children just like... I said,

415
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,125
"How cruel it is",

416
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,041
but now I know how children can be in the West.

417
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,166
I don't know if it's white skin or whatever you may say

418
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:58,250
that first we started a school you see, for them,

419
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,083
because there was no school available,

420
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,250
they were in a mess.

421
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,083
So we said, "All right in Dharamshala we'll start a school."

422
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,291
So we started a school in Dharamshala

423
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,250
and these children were brought

424
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,375
because they had no way to go anywhere

425
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,375
so in a hurry it was started, you see.

426
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:17,166
So there must be something also if you

427
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,166
just start a school in a great hurry

428
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,083
maybe some things are left out.

429
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,041
But these children were terrible

430
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,166
because they saw these teachers were Indians

431
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,250
so they came and started punching them,

432
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,000
they started showing tongue to them,

433
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,291
sometimes spitting at them, sometimes

434
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,208
- pinching and doing all kinds of things, you know.

435
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,125
So the teachers got a fright.

436
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:42,000
They said: "Baba, we can't look after these bounders,

437
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,375
God knows what they are up to.

438
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,291
One day they'll bring a knife and push it through us.

439
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,250
We don't know what to do."

440
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,041
And we have very bad experience in Shudy Camp

441
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,291
about these children

442
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,125
that they had no sense of proportion, nothing.

443
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,291
They were not cautious at all and

444
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,166
then I said: 'What will you do?

445
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,208
"They have already started jumping,"

446
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,083
they said, "from different places."

447
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,166
(I hope they are not jumping there.)

448
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,208
So... and one boy broke his leg.

449
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,083
They got a fright.

450
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,375
So I said: 'All right now you do one thing.

451
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,208
They are already spoilt

452
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,250
but take one foot-rule, ruler,

453
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,166
and keep it and say that

454
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,208
"If you misbehave this is the thing."

455
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,291
And once or twice just do a little bit like that."

456
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,208
Now that doesn't mean you go on beating your children.

457
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:37,000
I mean everything should not be taken to an extreme,

458
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,375
but there should be a balance.

459
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,125
Must understand.

460
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,250
So there was one boy who had come as a cook

461
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,250
from Austria and Yogi had asked him,

462
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,125
he thought that he is a Westerner -

463
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,375
"You'd better look after the children."

464
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,041
He started thrashing them, left and right.

465
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,208
Not the Indian women.

466
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,083
Indian women don't thrash so much,

467
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,041
you see we don't beat. I mean I have

468
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:01,083
slapped My daughter once, one daughter,

469
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:04,125
elder one and younger one twice in their lifetime.

470
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,083
We don't believe in thrashing,

471
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,208
but you see they're afraid of our eyes,

472
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:13,250
even they know what we want, what is good.

473
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:17,041
I'll tell you My younger daughter she,

474
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,291
when she went to college in Delhi she found

475
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,041
all the girls were wearing sleeveless blouses.

476
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:23,250
So she came and asked Me,

477
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,125
"Should I wear sleeveless blouses

478
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,000
because all the girls are wearing sleeveless blouses?"

479
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,250
I said, "Go ahead if you think so."

480
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,333
She said, "Mummy why don't you wear sleeveless blouse?"

481
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,291
I said, "I feel shy when I've worn it;

482
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,291
I don't like to expose My hands like that,

483
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,208
I don't like it, it's not good.

484
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,208
The arms, you see, should be covered, I think."

485
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,083
Immediately she said,

486
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,333
"Then it is no criteria if I say

487
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,375
I want this and all that you should say yes to everything.

488
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,125
You should have said, 'No,

489
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,083
no', to me. I would have been very happy."

490
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:01,291
So this wisdom is there in, among Indian children.

491
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,291
They like - like Avadut, as I told you,

492
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:05,291
he said that, "Then who will correct me,

493
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,208
who will stop me from doing wrong?"

494
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:09,291
But that's not with our children here,

495
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,041
so you see because, I don't know why,

496
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:15,000
but maybe that our roots are too deep or whatever it is

497
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,041
we have to keep controlled all the time

498
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,333
and wisdom is very important.

499
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,125
If you tell a child, "You have been very unmannerly," -

500
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:25,250
I mean, it's like saying the horridest thing to a child,

501
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,375
"you're unmannerly."

502
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,375
Or to say, "You are very unwise";

503
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,083
then the child feels very hurt.

504
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:33,250
"I'm unwise, I've not been seeing."

505
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,208
But the best thing would be to say,

506
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,208
"You are Sahaja Yogis, you are special people,

507
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,375
you can't do like that, you are Sahaja Yogis."

508
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,041
All the time go on telling them

509
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,083
how dignified they should be,

510
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:47,041
what is expected of a Sahaja Yogi, it is better.

511
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:49,208
But never spoil them.

512
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:52,166
This is one thing you should not do otherwise it will be

513
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,083
a permanent headache for you,

514
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,333
even if they are Realized souls whatever they may be.

515
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,291
But please see that you do not spoil them.

516
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,083
That's very important.

517
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,125
Also as I told you that,

518
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,166
"Don't talk ill of each other, on the back."

519
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,083
Is a very bad habit,

520
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,166
that's how you'll catch on bhoots

521
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,291
and you'll become extremely negative.

522
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:16,208
Any such thought comes into your mind, just stop it.

523
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:23,166
It's a very, nasty disease you see that spreads,

524
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,333
so it makes you - I mean, it's so sickening you know,

525
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,125
when I mean I hear about somebody

526
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,250
who talks ill of someone it's extremely sickening

527
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,333
because it's not being human.

528
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:38,333
You see in the animal, there's one animal called hyena.

529
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,125
And they say this hyena is like that.

530
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:46,041
It comes slowly and steals a child, or anything,

531
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,375
it's a very, sly type of an animal

532
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:53,166
and such a person we call as hyena in India,

533
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,208
such a person is called as a hyena

534
00:42:55,208 --> 00:43:00,125
and it's regarded as a very low type of a personality,

535
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,208
if they talk like this.

536
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,208
In Sahaja Yoga it doesn't behove.

537
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:07,375
No Sahaja Yogis should talk ill about each other.

538
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,166
Nor should they discuss each other.

539
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,083
Never!

540
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,333
Now somebody does that you must immediately say:

541
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,250
"Now, please I don't want to know.

542
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,041
Please don't tell me."

543
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,291
This is not a very good thing.

544
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:29,375
Politicians do like that, but not Sahaja Yogis.

545
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:32,125
Sahaja Yogis should not do,

546
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,166
because, you see you are great people, you are yogis.

547
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,333
Do you know how a yogi becomes

548
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,333
a Realized soul, in the normal way?

549
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,125
The other day I was reading a book

550
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,166
about Upanishadas and one of them was - today

551
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,166
only I saw it in the morning time when I got up.

552
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:54,000
There was written about a yogi

553
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,166
that,

554
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:02,125
"You have to really starve yourself, first of all.

555
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,041
Then you have to do shirshasana,

556
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,250
with that you have to do pranayama,

557
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,083
then you have to get up four o'clock in the morning

558
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,125
and take your bath,

559
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,250
and then sit down for dhyana,

560
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,250
and for five hours you must sit for your dhyana.

561
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,041
After that you have to do pranayama.

562
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,250
That's also special style.

563
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,333
It's not easy for normal person to do that

564
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
is till you say sixty you raise your left side,

565
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:35,000
take the prana through your,

566
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I mean you breathe through your nostril left one,

567
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:41,166
now sixty-four you say keep it here,

568
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:47,166
and then rechaka: you do the taking it out thirty-two times,

569
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,375
can you imagine?

570
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:52,166
This you have to do 108 times, every day,
00:44:53:07 00:44:55:02.minimum. This is the minimum."

571
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,166
Now there are so many exercises,

572
00:44:57,166 --> 00:44:59,208
if I tell you that, you'll be shocked.

573
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,375
So like,

574
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,375
you have to stand and suddenly jump

575
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:10,041
and put your both the feet five feet apart  imagine

576
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:13,208
Then turn round,

577
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,291
to clear your nadis you see,

578
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:17,208
you have to turn round

579
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:20,125
and put yourself on the left side.

580
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,166
Now on the left side you put yourself

581
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,250
and it's quite a big thing that they have described

582
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,291
but in short it's a stretching exercise,

583
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,083
and you put your hand on the left side

584
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,125
and go down stretch yourself,

585
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,250
again go back to normal,

586
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,041
again jump and go five feet apart.

587
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,000
Then put to the right side.

588
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,041
Nadi cleansing is this way.

589
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,041
But there are so many others described you see.

590
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,208
They are so horrible.

591
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,208
They said ordinary exercises for ordinary people,

592
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:51,000
but for a person who wants to achieve yoga,

593
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,291
he has to do all these horrible exercises

594
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,125
are I don't know, I mean,

595
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:57,166
by that time all your body will be broken

596
00:45:57,166 --> 00:46:01,000
the way it is or in any case you'll get moksha you see.

597
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,291
It's like that.

598
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:05,291
But what I'm trying to tell you is this

599
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,333
that now you've got everything simple

600
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,166
- easy this thing, but in a subtle way

601
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:15,083
still all these nonsensical things are sticking on,

602
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,083
and even if you are in the boat now,

603
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,208
still it is there and they are creating a heavy weight,

604
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:25,208
and this heavy weight can really

605
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,291
take you down again,

606
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:30,208
and when you go down after a certain height,

607
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,208
you go down very fast.

608
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,250
So many people we have thrown out of Sahaja Yoga,

609
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,375
so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

610
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,041
so many have come into Sahaja Yoga.

611
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:42,083
Now the people who have come in the beginning,

612
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,125
are excused for some time

613
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,333
and also they see you how you behave,

614
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,166
it's very important.

615
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:51,250
So first thing we must know that we are people

616
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,375
who are Sahaja Yogis special type of people,

617
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,250
specially placed

618
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,125
and we have so many privileges

619
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,333
so we have to be extremely dignified.

620
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,041
I've seen people just will laugh for nothing at all.

621
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,083
In a group, you are there,

622
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,000
they just start laughing.

623
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,083
There's no need to laugh

624
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,333
but they'll just start laughing.

625
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,125
Even if I am sitting they'll just go on chatting

626
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,041
and talking and, see no sense at all.

627
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:20,083
But if your Guru is sitting there you have to keep quiet,

628
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,333
you have to be humble,

629
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,291
you have to have awe.

630
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,250
All these things are important

631
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,208
which we have to gradually learn,

632
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,333
because you have never had a proper

633
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,041
training about spiritual life.

634
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,041
You see what these churches or you can say

635
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,083
these temples that you have seen or

636
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,250
anything else that you have got those,

637
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:45,041
you see have not been real masters to tell you

638
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,375
how to behave, how to address,

639
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,083
how to be there.

640
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,250
So, now, gradually you should see for yourself

641
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,083
that you have to grow, and grow very fast

642
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,000
and for that you have to remember

643
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,166
we must need our introspection, to see: 'Where am I?

644
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,333
Now what am I doing?

645
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,083
Ah, now the anger is coming.'

646
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,333
As soon as the anger starts coming

647
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,166
go and stand before your mirror and say:

648
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:12,000
'Now come along let's get angry.'

649
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,125
You face yourself all the time and it will help.

650
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,375
Not the others.

651
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,166
Now I have to tell you that whenever you find

652
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:25,250
such people coming up they will form a group,

653
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,000
then a group can become bigger or absolutely small,

654
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,250
depending on you.

655
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,291
You have to just say:

656
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,166
'Mother has said not to listen a word against anyone.

657
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,375
Just not to listen.

658
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,166
And in the beginning of course it is,

659
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,000
quite a lot has to be tolerated.

660
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,291
Like I've seen if you see the letters written to Me

661
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

662
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,166
they are so maddening.

663
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,208
This person talking ill about that,

664
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,041
that person talking ill about that,

665
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,208
I mean, anybody would be mad to read all that.

666
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,000
So I never read them.

667
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,250
All these letters I used to just burn away.

668
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,000
But luckily now these people have become

669
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,125
extremely sensible,

670
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:06,000
they understand their responsibility,

671
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,166
they have become very, very beautiful people,

672
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,000
very understanding,

673
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,166
and the love that they have for each other,

674
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,000
it's very interesting.

675
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,208
Only in love you can know about others, not in hatred.

676
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:20,000
If you hate someone how will you know about that person,

677
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,250
the beauty of that person?

678
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,041
So then you start seeing the beauty of that person

679
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,041
and you start enjoying that person.

680
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:28,041
This is what Sahaja Yoga is.

681
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:32,375
So I would like you to see that you train your children

682
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:38,166
in such a manner that they feel their responsibilities

683
00:49:38,166 --> 00:49:40,041
as Sahaja Yogis.

684
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,083
May God bless you!

685
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,875
Better be on the lookout, there’s smaller children also.

686
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,291
And never neglect them,

687
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,250
of course, never neglect them.

688
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,333
Never leave them alone

689
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,250
even if you are going, you are doing the job,

690
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,125
you can give it up for the children's sake, for certain age.

691
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,291
Then you can take up when they're...

692
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:07,166
there are so many things you can do in the house also for this.

693
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,333
And also men should understand that they must

694
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,208
every day spend some time with their children.

695
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,083
This is extremely important,

696
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,291
because children are so relaxing.

697
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,458
Look at her, she’s running off.

698
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,542
My attention is all there.

699
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:30,834
I hope they don't..

700
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,083
Are they careful children?

701
00:50:35,041 --> 00:50:36,208
Or keep someone there...

702
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:40,333
Some lady can be alternately with children,

703
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,083
one after another, better look after them.

704
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,291
So now, it's a very nice place we have come to

705
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:10,083
and I hope this work will be done now.

706
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:13,125
We have done the inauguration and it will be all ready.

707
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:17,291
It would be as they said, would be three storeys.

708
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,375
Would be a good idea if it works out

709
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:24,041
and I don't know what you are going to do here,

710
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,291
what's going to work out.

711
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,166
Did you dig it out for your - is it?...

712
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,125
Fireplace? It's going to be a fireplace.

713
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,375
And what will you have up there,

714
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,333
in the gap?

715
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,083
… Another on top?

716
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:19,291
Good. How did you carry it up there? …

717
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,625
Prefabricated.

718
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,583
So now what is the next program?

719
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:02,250
Is the lunch, is it? All right …

720
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:13,834
Somebody’s there.

721
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,667
Please look after them.

722
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,000
Alternately, you see, can do it.

723
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:55,999
You should finish everything, you know.

724
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,125
Don’t leave anything here.

725
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:51,959
It’s too much. Now you eat this one. All right?

726
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,917
I can’t have so much of it. It’s a heart here!

727
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,250
Yogini asks about looking after Western teenage children.

728
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,250
What happened?

729
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:35,500
… Fourteen and fifteen?

730
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,792
And they’re not in Sahaja Yoga? …

731
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,458
I think you need to send them to some school in India. …

732
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:53,709
My Husband is not australian….[?]

733
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,000
He will allow?

734
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,959
Into – it need not be, you see, it need not be a Sahaja school,

735
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:05,583
just not started, but we can put them in a school which is,

736
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:09,542
what you can call it a normal Indian school.

737
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:13,583
One of the admissions you can get them, in a hostel.

738
01:00:15,834 --> 01:00:17,250
That will save them.

739
01:00:17,709 --> 01:00:20,583
And once we start our high school, they can join us.

740
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:24,999
Because they have to be brought up properly.

741
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:38,125
Also, there are so many other temptations, I can tell you.

742
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,083
It’s very dangerous...

743
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:52,375
You give Me their names.

744
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:54,834
You can get them admitted.

745
01:00:55,417 --> 01:01:01,041
And say that these children would like to get admitted

746
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,083
into some school there.

747
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,917
But the standard in India is very hard.

748
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,041
They’ll have to go one year less, but it’s all right;

749
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,709
but they’ll have very good education there.

750
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:18,834
Go with her and find out a school.

751
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,917
It can be anywhere: in Bombay, Pune, anywhere.

752
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:31,083
That would be cheaper, definitely, than schools here,

753
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,999
and they’ll be disciplined.

754
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:36,291
I agree with you …

755
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,208
Nobody’s bothered, you see.

756
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,333
Because they trouble the teacher also.

757
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,583
And also the government is not bothered.

758
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,875
Children are so precocious, they know so many things –

759
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:04,083
– it’s horrible, I tell you.

760
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:07,583
It’s difficult to understand such small children knowing things

761
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:10,959
which we did not even know when we were medical students.

762
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,542
Oh, thank you.

763
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,875
Two, three children, or which is the youngest?

764
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,542
The youngest is what age?

765
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,834
She’s the youngest.

766
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:42,542
What is her age? … Eleven.

767
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,083
Still she’s not very young.

768
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,750
Three of them can go.

769
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,625
Big for her age, and very good.

770
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,792
So he’s very tall, eh?

771
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,834
They get taller and taller, eh?

772
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:03,792
What’s your height now?

773
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:07,208
You’re already five-ten, or something?

774
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:12,792
Your father is tall, is he?

775
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,709
Yes, that’s right. You’d like to go to India?

776
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,417
Good. Nice. You should find out a school...

777
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,750
That’s what they told Me when the children...

778
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,166
I won’t be going to India for quite some time,

779
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:10,750
but we could ask Yogi if he can arrange for their

780
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,000
admission into some good school...

781
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,250
What class are you? Eleven. O-level?

782
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:54,208
You should finish, I think, in any case.

783
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:57,959
Otherwise you’ll be just …

784
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,166
That is O-level, no? A-level …

785
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,375
So you have done A-level already?

786
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:17,500
You are doing O-level.

787
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,792
I think let him finish O-level, is important.

788
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,166
Then he goes to college?

789
01:05:24,709 --> 01:05:26,125
You can get an admission in college.

790
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:29,208
After one year.

791
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:32,959
In India he goes into a college.

792
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:39,375
He can take up arts or something like that, whatever …

793
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,000
You want to do computer?

794
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:45,875
What do you like?

795
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:50,375
What subjects you have now? Maths, eh?

796
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,291
You don’t like maths.

797
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:01,917
Now, what else? Biology?

798
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,291
You have biology.

799
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,917
You like biology?

800
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,291
...Genetics...

801
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,709
All right, we’ll see now for a college for you,

802
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:13,709
whatever he wants to do.

803
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:15,667
Is he good at English?

804
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:20,041
You like to write?

805
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,667
You’d like to do journalism?

806
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:31,000
Think about it. Let us know.

807
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:34,208
Journalism is easy in India, if you want to do journalism,

808
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,917
But even genetics you might find admission – you try.

809
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:45,041
...Thirteen. Now, what class he is?

810
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:47,709
Yes, he can go to school.

811
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,291
No, it’s all right. This shawl is quite good.

812
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:03,291
By next April will it be ready? I’ll be here! ….

813
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,000
Once you teach them, they will do it.

814
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:13,917
And this gets fixed into it, you don’t have to do anything.

815
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:34,291
Is that cement blocks…?

816
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:07,792
We too have something like this, but they are very weak in India.

817
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:27,125
But these can hold two storeys?
