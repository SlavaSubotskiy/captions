00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,723
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

2
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:33,796
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

3
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:42,853
and you should know that the essence of Guru

4
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:46,636
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

5
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:53,916
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

6
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:58,236
faithful wife, of a sati.

7
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:02,676
Her name was Anasuya,

8
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:09,076
and she was so religious

9
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:12,836
and so dedicated

10
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:17,396
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

11
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:24,236
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

12
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:31,203
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

13
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:37,516
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

14
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,756
So all of them came down as sadhus,

15
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:45,716
dressed up like sanyasis.

16
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:51,556
And she said she wanted to serve them,

17
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:54,556
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

18
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:57,956
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

19
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:01,436
She cooked food for them.

20
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:04,396
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

21
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:07,956
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

22
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:12,356
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

23
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,756
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

24
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:20,396
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

25
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:23,676
and then she became nude,

26
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:27,716
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

27
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:31,116
And then she joined them together,

28
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:35,556
their three innocences were joined together

29
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:44,636
and they got their Gurupada.

30
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:49,636
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

31
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:55,916
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

32
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:58,756
you have to be innocent.

33
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:04,076
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

34
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:11,956
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

35
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:15,636
But what is the nature of innocence?

36
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:21,396
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

37
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:22,436
First of all

38
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:29,676
He's endowed with wisdom,

39
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:36,516
and He puts wisdom into us.

40
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:44,556
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

41
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:52,036
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

42
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:59,156
It is He who puts genetics in us.

43
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:07,116
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

44
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:11,236
and when He puts wisdom in us,

45
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:16,076
then we are wise.

46
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:22,636
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

47
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,556
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

48
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,356
They have no wisdom.

49
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:33,036
They do things without wisdom.

50
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:38,556
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

51
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,196
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

52
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:44,636
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

53
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:47,116
but you can see from their behavior they're,

54
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:51,036
that they have no wisdom at all.

55
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:58,356
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

56
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:01,396
In some people who are not yet evolved,

57
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:04,436
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

58
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:08,036
this wisdom is lacking.

59
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,196
Apart from that,

60
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:17,796
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

61
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:26,196
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

62
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:30,396
all kinds of bad habits.

63
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,836
We don't like to look at nudity.

64
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:41,356
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

65
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:48,636
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

66
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:56,116
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

67
00:05:56,836 --> 00:06:02,476
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

68
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:07,636
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

69
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,396
We are automatically dharmic.

70
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,556
We don't kill others,

71
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,676
we don't aggress others,

72
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,956
we don't torture others.

73
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:23,436
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

74
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:27,276
or take away anything,

75
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:31,716
another's property or another's things.

76
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:37,116
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

77
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:44,396
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

78
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,756
It is He only ultimately

79
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,836
who looks after us

80
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:55,756
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

81
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:59,236
because

82
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:04,436
He stops all other activities of excretion

83
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:11,836
when you are ascending into new realm.

84
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:17,036
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

85
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,876
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

86
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:23,556
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

87
00:07:24,036 --> 00:07:29,196
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

88
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:33,316
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

89
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:37,796
So this wisdom is innate,

90
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:42,196
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

91
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:46,916
He becomes, manifesting in us -

92
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:51,716
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

93
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:56,436
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

94
00:07:56,676 --> 00:08:00,716
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

95
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,636
You become the child,

96
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:06,436
at that time you become a child.

97
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:08,676
And with the kundalini rising,

98
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:12,396
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

99
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,645
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

100
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,876
He's the power in the kundalini.

101
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:21,916
He gives wisdom in the brain.

102
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:27,276
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

103
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:31,876
all your attachments which are wrong,

104
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:37,876
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

105
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:41,396
He changes, your genetics are changed.

106
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:45,316
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

107
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:47,876
about the same I would say,

108
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:54,316
and the genetics of other people would be different.

109
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:57,516
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

110
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:00,836
because Indians normally are very wise people.

111
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,588
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

112
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,796
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

113
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,476
Indians are very wise.

114
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:12,196
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

115
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,676
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

116
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,316
when they go to India: they went for this school,

117
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:21,314
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

118
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,115
nobody could understand.

119
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:25,916
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

120
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:27,556
They got malaria.

121
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:31,836
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

122
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:36,876
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

123
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:38,756
So they put a gate.

124
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,916
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

125
00:09:42,196 --> 00:09:45,116
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

126
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:51,676
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

127
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:54,436
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

128
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,716
he understands the importance of his life.

129
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,836
He respects his parents, he respects everything

130
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:03,556
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

131
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:09,436
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

132
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:16,196
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

133
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,996
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

134
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:27,436
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

135
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:33,636
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

136
00:10:33,956 --> 00:10:37,276
so much developed in these Western countries,

137
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:40,956
people took to stupid things.

138
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:46,476
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

139
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:50,996
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

140
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,436
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

141
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:57,388
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

142
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,236
they have no Ganesha.

143
00:10:59,476 --> 00:11:01,676
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

144
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:05,116
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

145
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:09,556
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

146
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,196
Before that you just call "holy father",

147
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,516
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

148
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:18,996
which can create holes in the organization;

149
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:24,876
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

150
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:29,676
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

151
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,236
So this wisdom part is so important,

152
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:36,626
and that's what we should ask

153
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,996
Ganesha, to make us like children.

154
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:44,756
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

155
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,116
This is the thing is,

156
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:50,236
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

157
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:55,276
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

158
00:11:57,076 --> 00:12:00,796
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

159
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:06,076
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

160
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:09,276
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

161
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:12,115
because there's no strength from within.

162
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:15,755
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

163
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,675
Now you know yourself,

164
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,195
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

165
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:22,476
they behave differently, they stand differently,

166
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,310
they talk differently, they think differently, they

167
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,916
- everything is different.

168
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:30,796
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

169
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:35,836
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

170
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,276
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

171
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:40,636
everything they did.

172
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,516
But how is it suddenly you changed?

173
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:48,636
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

174
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:54,276
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

175
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:59,316
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

176
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:05,116
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

177
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:08,076
But is it so with us?

178
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:12,876
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

179
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:17,916
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

180
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:21,436
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

181
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,116
that means they have to ascend still.

182
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,876
People who have worked with Me,

183
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,516
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

184
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:32,316
There's no need to pay,

185
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:35,636
because after all I have done so much for your building,

186
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,636
your body, why should I pay you?

187
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,556
But I always pay sumptuously,

188
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:41,436
I look after them, give them ...

189
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,556
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

190
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:49,436
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

191
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,996
extremely selfish.

192
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:55,116
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

193
00:13:55,356 --> 00:14:00,036
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

194
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:05,916
Or they just try to find some excuse.

195
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,396
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

196
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,236
They are not sincere.

197
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,916
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

198
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:17,556
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

199
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,316
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

200
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:23,796
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

201
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,556
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

202
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,276
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

203
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:43,836
For example, someone becomes sick.

204
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:47,556
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

205
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:51,396
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

206
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,556
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

207
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:57,716
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

208
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,436
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

209
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,716
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

210
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:09,396
what is important.

211
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,836
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

212
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:16,436
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

213
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:20,796
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

214
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:23,316
All kinds of liabilities come in,

215
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:27,076
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

216
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:30,036
You solve the problem with your husband.

217
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,316
You solve the problem with your children.

218
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,236
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

219
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,556
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

220
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,236
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

221
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,556
can you believe that?

222
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,716
Nobody else can touch it.

223
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,196
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

224
00:15:48,396 --> 00:15:50,716
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:15:50,996 --> 00:15:53,036
So we have many cases like that.

226
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,796
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

227
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,756
they have seen miraculous photographs,

228
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,196
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

229
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,956
they have been so many times helped.

230
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:06,516
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

231
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,236
"Very good," I say,

232
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:11,956
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

233
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:17,116
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

234
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,916
and no place for such half-hearted people.

235
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,316
If they have to leave, they should leave.

236
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:28,556
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

237
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:31,423
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

238
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,594
That way you were worshipping Christ,

239
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,715
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

240
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:39,196
But what has come inside you, is the point.

241
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:43,116
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

242
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:49,196
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

243
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:54,556
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

244
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:59,876
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

245
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:03,756
You are also made the same way.

246
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,996
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

247
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:11,516
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

248
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:15,116
All these things have happened to you

249
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:19,436
without having a father.

250
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:24,196
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

251
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:27,556
you would never have known.

252
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,356
Like, other gurus, you see,

253
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:35,636
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

254
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,556
So this actually has happened with you,

255
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:43,795
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

256
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,515
Of course you must be having something, you know,

257
00:17:46,636 --> 00:17:49,196
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

258
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:54,756
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

259
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:59,756
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

260
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:00,916
if not crooked,

261
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:05,156
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

262
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:11,836
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

263
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,116
that you were seeking it truly,

264
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:20,356
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

265
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:24,156
Still, when the growth is taking place,

266
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,356
you must watch,

267
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:31,156
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

268
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:37,356
with what dedication we are working out?

269
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,236
Now, we have people

270
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,036
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

271
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,036
- not now, it's long time back -

272
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:49,796
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

273
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:53,196
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

274
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:57,156
otherwise they would have charged Me!

275
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:04,236
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

276
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,236
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

277
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:10,716
But still we have people on the periphery,

278
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,276
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

279
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:17,036
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

280
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:17,956
You don't know,

281
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:23,916
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

282
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,356
and then He stopped it.

283
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,876
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

284
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:30,796
then only the storm stopped,

285
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,716
just to prove that these songs have such power.

286
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,635
If such things don't happen,

287
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:39,684
how will you know that these songs have the power?

288
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,881
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

289
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,333
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

290
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:47,785
all awakened songs.

291
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:51,436
And then it stopped.

292
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,836
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

293
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,515
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

294
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:00,236
Suddenly they thought of singing,

295
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,356
and then it worked out.

296
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:05,276
Because every time if I have to suggest,

297
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:08,916
then when will you use your power?

298
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:10,756
All such incidents take place,

299
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:13,276
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

300
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:14,898
He's the real judge for you.

301
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,636
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

302
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,436
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

303
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:24,516
So there is a testing point also.

304
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:27,756
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

305
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:30,436
But there's a bigger door on the back side

306
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:33,516
to throw out people.

307
00:20:38,316 --> 00:20:42,516
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

308
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:46,996
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

309
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,156
Then to come back is very difficult.

310
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:54,156
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

311
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:56,636
and others are also suspicious of you.

312
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,236
So you see, what you have to understand

313
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:02,996
is that this is a judgment point.

314
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,916
Introspect yourself, find out,

315
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:10,556
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

316
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,316
Is it wise for me to do?

317
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:17,276
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

318
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:18,956
Should I do it or not?"

319
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,116
At every point you should see.

320
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,996
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

321
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,674
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

322
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:27,915
but they won't listen.

323
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:28,909
Now they are saying that

324
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,383
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

325
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:34,315
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

326
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:36,556
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

327
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:38,192
there's one thing definitely:

328
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:42,073
there's love, and you want to express it.

329
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:46,276
But love here is not attached;

330
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:52,796
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

331
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:56,796
takes all the responsibility.

332
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,636
There is people, there are people

333
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,156
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

334
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:05,076
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

335
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:08,076
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

336
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,636
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

337
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:12,796
He's trying to criticize others,

338
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:16,556
does he see what is wrong with him?

339
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:20,396
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

340
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:25,556
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

341
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:30,036
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

342
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:35,116
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

343
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:38,196
and they are in the sternum bones first,

344
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:40,676
and then they go all over the body.

345
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:44,516
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

346
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:49,476
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

347
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:52,236
So we have to be alert.

348
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:56,036
It's very important that we have to be alert.

349
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:58,116
For about twelve years of your age

350
00:22:58,316 --> 00:23:02,236
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

351
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:04,596
and then they go to the whole body,

352
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,275
because they are matured enough.

353
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:08,912
They are kept there till they are completely matured

354
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,796
to fight the enemies.

355
00:23:11,036 --> 00:23:15,076
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

356
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:19,556
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

357
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:25,316
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

358
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:29,196
who should fight whom, who should do this.

359
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:34,556
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

360
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:39,196
So we have to go to the people.

361
00:23:39,796 --> 00:23:42,756
We have to go into the Virata's body.

362
00:23:42,956 --> 00:23:46,876
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

363
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:50,556
without having any fear you have to fight them.

364
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,804
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

365
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:55,276
now you are all grown-up people.

366
00:23:55,516 --> 00:24:02,396
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

367
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:07,556
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

368
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:08,876
"Ma treya."

369
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:12,396
But also that He goes all out in the society,

370
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:17,556
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

371
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:22,916
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

372
00:24:23,516 --> 00:24:26,996
Guru doesn't sit at home.

373
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:30,196
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

374
00:24:30,396 --> 00:24:34,796
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

375
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:36,661
You have to live in the society,

376
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:39,066
you don't have to have exclusive society

377
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:42,996
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

378
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:47,556
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

379
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:51,036
But you have to go beyond.

380
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:55,196
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

381
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:59,796
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

382
00:24:59,996 --> 00:25:02,116
but you have to go all out,

383
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,796
meet other people,

384
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:05,396
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:08,556
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

386
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:13,036
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

387
00:25:13,236 --> 00:25:16,196
You don't have to give up anything,

388
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,636
don't have to give up anything.

389
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:24,198
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

390
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,633
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

391
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:28,676
also disco dance they showed you.

392
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:31,716
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

393
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:35,836
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

394
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,876
Or do this kind of a disco more there

395
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,036
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

396
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:47,036
Then you say, "We are copying you."

397
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:52,421
That will put them down.

398
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,236
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

399
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:58,114
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

400
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,835
and smoking like this.

401
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:02,796
She'll stop it.

402
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,236
So by copying them, one way,

403
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:09,556
showing them what they are - another, writing.

404
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:11,156
You must have writing.

405
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:14,716
It's very important to write and answer.

406
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,476
I must tell that there's a very nice article

407
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,276
which has come now with Me,

408
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,789
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

409
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,710
and answer the gentleman.

410
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:27,756
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

411
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:31,276
You must know what's happening all around -

412
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:34,956
what's happening in Bosnia,

413
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,556
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

414
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,756
You should read newspapers.

415
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:42,556
You can see television also,

416
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:45,476
when - and now, when you are matured.

417
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,316
Otherwise if you see television,

418
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:51,276
you'll go mad like other television people are.

419
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,236
So what's the use of seeing the television?

420
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:59,036
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

421
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:03,116
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

422
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:07,316
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

423
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:12,716
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

424
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,916
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

425
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:22,276
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

426
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:24,476
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

427
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,476
then you have to be like ganas

428
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:31,916
who go all out, and work it out.

429
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:35,196
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

430
00:27:35,477 --> 00:27:37,074
which you can play on these people

431
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,195
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

432
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:42,196
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

433
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:43,756
You should not shun them.

434
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:47,156
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

435
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:50,756
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

436
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,676
You should write.

437
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:57,756
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

438
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,196
which are money-oriented

439
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:03,676
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

440
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:08,356
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

441
00:28:09,076 --> 00:28:14,716
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

442
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:20,196
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

443
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:23,076
Try to now assert yourself.

444
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:24,716
Unless and until you do that,

445
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:29,636
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,716
You might get very great people out of that.

447
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:36,196
You can invite some people, you can call them.

448
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:39,516
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

449
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:42,556
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

450
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:44,716
as soon as they go to some house.

451
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,516
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

452
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:51,956
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

453
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:55,916
you can say a kind of a

454
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,996
negotiations, you can call it,

455
00:29:02,236 --> 00:29:06,116
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

456
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,636
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

457
00:29:08,796 --> 00:29:11,076
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

458
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:13,116
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

459
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:16,776
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

460
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:20,195
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

461
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:23,276
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

462
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:25,516
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

463
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:29,956
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

464
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:32,085
They would like to meet you. You should say:

465
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,995
"We found out this, we found out that."

466
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:37,756
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

467
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:40,156
you have to do this special work,

468
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:43,076
is to understand now you are matured enough,

469
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:45,476
you have to go in the society.

470
00:29:45,796 --> 00:29:46,956
Now if you get upset,

471
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,928
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

472
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,156
It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:54,196
You are not going to be crucified,

474
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:56,276
you are not going to be murdered.

475
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,676
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

476
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:02,316
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

477
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:07,076
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

478
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:11,236
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

479
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,810
You are the marked people, who are going -

480
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,796
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

481
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:18,916
Why should you be afraid?

482
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,716
Why should you not meet people?

483
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:24,556
Then also I said, make some music.

484
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,995
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

485
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,571
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

486
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:36,236
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

487
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:41,236
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

488
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:43,916
but the message should be clear, it should not be

489
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:46,876
- I can never understand what they are singing.

490
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,796
So every word should be clear-cut.

491
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:53,636
We can go all out to have real publicity,

492
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:57,236
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

493
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:59,476
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

494
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:03,636
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

495
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:05,916
Also we should not say

496
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,636
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

497
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,836
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

498
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:14,476
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

499
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:17,956
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

500
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:20,476
where we can discuss about these things.

501
00:31:20,676 --> 00:31:23,196
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

502
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:25,516
- morning time is always free -

503
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,316
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

504
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:32,356
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

505
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:34,240
And there you can discuss things,

506
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:36,681
how we can proceed, what we can do.

507
00:31:36,802 --> 00:31:39,316
Now the time has come. It's over now,

508
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:42,956
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

509
00:31:43,156 --> 00:31:46,236
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

510
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,996
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

511
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,996
"Now the doomsday has come.

512
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:54,996
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

513
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:59,876
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

514
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:04,076
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

515
00:32:04,316 --> 00:32:07,716
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

516
00:32:07,996 --> 00:32:10,516
Unless and until you take your realization,

517
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:15,276
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

518
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:18,716
All these genetic problems can be only solved

519
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:21,556
if you get your realization.

520
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,436
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

521
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:30,156
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

522
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,116
There are so many children in this world,

523
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,316
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

524
00:32:35,676 --> 00:32:38,396
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

525
00:32:38,636 --> 00:32:43,116
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

526
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:45,956
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

527
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:48,476
Before marriage

528
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:52,796
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

529
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,345
But if they are married, they kill their children.

530
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,115
So many people kill their children,

531
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,356
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

532
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,636
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

533
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:07,556
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

534
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:14,356
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

535
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:19,476
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

536
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:23,516
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

537
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:28,076
your nourishment that is needed.

538
00:33:28,436 --> 00:33:30,236
You have to give love to everyone,

539
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,076
you have to care for everyone,

540
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,756
but you shouldn't get attached.

541
00:33:35,076 --> 00:33:38,836
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

542
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:42,556
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

543
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:46,636
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

544
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,716
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

545
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,436
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

546
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:56,316
he came back, and they went away with him.

547
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,276
That shows you have not developed your personality.

548
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:04,996
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

549
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:08,916
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

550
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:13,756
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

551
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:17,756
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

552
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:21,116
but God has chosen you.

553
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:28,116
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

554
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:31,876
In every aspect of life one should understand.

555
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:34,756
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

556
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:36,271
I don't want anything from you;

557
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:38,352
as it is you know how much I am spending.

558
00:34:38,473 --> 00:34:41,276
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

559
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:45,476
you must go all out to help with money also.

560
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:49,396
People will, they spend money in, say, races

561
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:53,476
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

562
00:34:53,796 --> 00:34:55,516
All that money is saved now,

563
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:57,956
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

564
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:02,396
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

565
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,036
Then another thing is, people just start asking

566
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,396
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

567
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:13,156
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

568
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:17,316
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

569
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,676
How do you have this, say, tent?

570
00:35:19,876 --> 00:35:22,676
How do you have this land?

571
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:26,036
How do you have Daglio?

572
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,954
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

573
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:34,195
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

574
00:35:34,316 --> 00:35:39,396
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

575
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:44,996
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

576
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,396
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

577
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:52,316
It's giving no money at all.

578
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:55,996
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

579
00:35:56,316 --> 00:36:00,476
And if you start saving money on that also,

580
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:03,676
then I don't know what to say to you.

581
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,156
It doesn't mean like

582
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:08,239
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

583
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,880
but your dedication.

584
00:36:12,876 --> 00:36:15,076
If you have the dedication

585
00:36:15,316 --> 00:36:19,276
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

586
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:22,118
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

587
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,074
Now school has to be built.

588
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:26,755
Who has built Vashi?

589
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:28,956
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

590
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:33,876
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

591
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:40,916
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

592
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:44,516
You all have prospered in life,

593
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:47,076
you all have got sufficient money,

594
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:51,756
but what are you doing?

595
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:59,556
So in this aspect is,

596
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:05,316
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

597
00:37:05,716 --> 00:37:08,396
Another side is your creativity.

598
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:12,756
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

599
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:14,996
If they have to give any present

600
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,676
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

601
00:37:18,996 --> 00:37:23,196
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

602
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,396
If they could give even one piece like that

603
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:29,396
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

604
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:33,916
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

605
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:37,556
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

606
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:41,836
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

607
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:45,476
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

608
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:49,636
their programs and things can make some money.

609
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:53,876
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

610
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,796
Do you know we, I just asked once

611
00:37:57,036 --> 00:38:00,316
that collect some money for Indian project,

612
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,676
one year, in Sahasrara.

613
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:03,916
You must know that,

614
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,716
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

615
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,476
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

616
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,756
in the bank.

617
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:16,636
How can you send five thousand to India?

618
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,876
What will they think of you?

619
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:28,556
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

620
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,276
not for Indian children.

621
00:38:32,516 --> 00:38:37,036
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

622
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,196
Thus we should realize

623
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:42,756
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

624
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:45,716
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

625
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,756
We should have some money for our organization.

626
00:38:50,116 --> 00:38:53,516
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

627
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,436
that's very little amount;

628
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:58,956
but still we are managing.

629
00:39:00,556 --> 00:39:05,676
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

630
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:11,476
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

631
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:13,248
I don't need any money.

632
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,316
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

633
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:20,996
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

634
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:27,276
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

635
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,396
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

636
00:39:30,756 --> 00:39:33,556
but are you respectful like that?

637
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:38,636
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

638
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:42,436
Once, His Father said that

639
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:45,636
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

640
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,156
I'll give that person a present."

641
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:52,356
So another brother, Kartikeya,

642
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:57,716
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

643
00:39:58,036 --> 00:40:00,356
was a peacock,

644
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:06,836
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

645
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:09,796
and He could never have competed with Him.

646
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,076
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

647
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:13,836
She is the greatest of all.

648
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:16,916
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

649
00:40:17,037 --> 00:40:19,304
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

650
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:22,116
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

651
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:26,476
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

652
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:34,036
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

653
00:40:35,396 --> 00:40:38,716
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

654
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:42,716
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

655
00:40:42,996 --> 00:40:46,916
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

656
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:49,276
But despite that, try to understand.

657
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:53,356
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

658
00:40:53,716 --> 00:40:58,076
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

659
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,556
that this is the Power sitting before you.

660
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,356
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

661
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:08,876
what we do, is all wrong.

662
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:13,076
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

663
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:16,196
that means kundalini has not come there.

664
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:21,036
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

665
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:24,476
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

666
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:27,836
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

667
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:32,196
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

668
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:36,356
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

669
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,636
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

670
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,116
none of you have doubts about it.

671
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:45,036
And not only that it's happening through Me,

672
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,756
but you also can do it now.

673
00:41:46,956 --> 00:41:51,476
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

674
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:58,356
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

675
00:41:58,556 --> 00:42:01,196
I joke, I make fun,

676
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:06,916
I do everything just like a normal mother.

677
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:10,756
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

678
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:13,196
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

679
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:15,476
I must tell you: be careful,

680
00:42:15,756 --> 00:42:18,669
you can't write rude letters to Me.

681
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,915
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

682
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,035
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

683
00:42:23,156 --> 00:42:25,875
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

684
00:42:25,996 --> 00:42:29,956
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

685
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:33,796
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

686
00:42:34,076 --> 00:42:35,396
you must understand this,

687
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:38,996
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

688
00:42:40,196 --> 00:42:42,876
This side is, of course,

689
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:48,916
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

690
00:42:49,636 --> 00:42:56,676
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

691
00:42:58,156 --> 00:43:00,956
Others may little bit hesitate,

692
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:04,236
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

693
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:06,116
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

694
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:10,956
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

695
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:18,396
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

696
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:23,636
because He has a parasha in His hand

697
00:43:24,196 --> 00:43:28,236
and people get punished, no doubt.

698
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:33,396
So this is another thing one has to understand,

699
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:36,996
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

700
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:40,876
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

701
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:44,236
which you don't know.

702
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:50,036
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

703
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,956
But what is missing is the faith.

704
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:59,516
not blind but enlightened faith.

705
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:03,476
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

706
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:07,196
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

707
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,476
he's an Indian

708
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:13,756
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

709
00:44:14,036 --> 00:44:15,476
- very good man.

710
00:44:15,716 --> 00:44:20,076
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

711
00:44:20,996 --> 00:44:24,676
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

712
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:28,116
Some people tried to trouble him.

713
00:44:29,196 --> 00:44:33,756
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

714
00:44:33,956 --> 00:44:36,996
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

715
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:40,036
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

716
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:43,876
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

717
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:46,234
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

718
00:44:46,355 --> 00:44:48,796
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

719
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,796
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

720
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:56,076
And still today they haven't got jobs.

721
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:01,676
He said, "I had told you."

722
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:04,554
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

723
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,835
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

724
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:11,276
But nothing works out now.

725
00:45:12,636 --> 00:45:16,716
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

726
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:20,356
in Me, and in yourself.

727
00:45:20,477 --> 00:45:22,649
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

728
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,556
how can they have faith in others?

729
00:45:27,356 --> 00:45:30,836
This is another one thing you must understand,

730
00:45:31,116 --> 00:45:34,676
that you have tremendous powers,

731
00:45:35,116 --> 00:45:38,196
tremendous powers if you have faith.

732
00:45:38,556 --> 00:45:40,676
You'll just pray,

733
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,947
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

734
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,466
or this lady to be cured."

735
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:46,876
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

736
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:49,276
but your faith.

737
00:45:49,476 --> 00:45:52,116
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

738
00:45:52,356 --> 00:45:54,476
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

739
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:57,316
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

740
00:45:57,516 --> 00:46:02,516
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

741
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:05,476
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

742
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:08,156
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

743
00:46:08,356 --> 00:46:11,676
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

744
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:13,516
Why should I cure anymore?

745
00:46:13,716 --> 00:46:17,436
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

746
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:20,996
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

747
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:22,796
Just pray.

748
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:26,436
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

749
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:30,836
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

750
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:33,396
You have got that.

751
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:38,356
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

752
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,636
But if you are not generous,

753
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:43,836
calculating each and every pai - finished.

754
00:46:44,156 --> 00:46:46,156
Why should you?

755
00:46:46,476 --> 00:46:49,276
The Lakshmi will serve you.

756
00:46:49,636 --> 00:46:52,796
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

757
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:54,796
He never bothered.

758
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:58,316
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

759
00:46:58,636 --> 00:47:02,196
With human heads you should manage much better -

760
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:06,636
or do you need elephant heads?

761
00:47:10,076 --> 00:47:11,636
Then another thing He has,

762
00:47:11,876 --> 00:47:15,196
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

763
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:18,516
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

764
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:21,636
is the modoka He eats.

765
00:47:22,396 --> 00:47:28,836
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

766
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:31,356
which has got all these dry fruits

767
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:34,116
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

768
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:40,476
And that is one capacity He has,

769
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,636
to eat;

770
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,356
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

771
00:47:45,556 --> 00:47:47,556
But Mine is just the other way round:

772
00:47:47,796 --> 00:47:50,276
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

773
00:47:50,556 --> 00:47:54,316
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

774
00:47:54,636 --> 00:47:56,556
But He can eat well.

775
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:59,036
And whatever you eat,

776
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:04,156
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

777
00:48:04,556 --> 00:48:09,036
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

778
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:16,836
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

779
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:20,076
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

780
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:21,636
I said, "All right."

781
00:48:21,836 --> 00:48:23,396
As soon as we cooled it down,

782
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:26,476
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

783
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:28,756
So He came with full force,

784
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:30,116
He cooled it down

785
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:33,116
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

786
00:48:33,316 --> 00:48:35,516
because there was no water in these streams.

787
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:40,076
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

788
00:48:41,196 --> 00:48:45,436
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

789
00:48:45,996 --> 00:48:48,836
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

790
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:51,916
Even a little tent was not blown off.

791
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:55,636
It was all fun.

792
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,516
This is what is,

793
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:04,476
that you are also a testing ground for others.

794
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,076
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

795
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:10,556
You are so powerful.

796
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:14,916
Use your powers, use your powers.

797
00:49:15,116 --> 00:49:18,676
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

798
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,916
it's not pure. Attention is on other

799
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:27,396
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

800
00:49:27,876 --> 00:49:30,556
keep attention on Me.

801
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:33,436
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

802
00:49:33,636 --> 00:49:36,276
He is there to work out everything for you,

803
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:40,116
His ganas are there to work out for you?

804
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:44,476
So put your attention in such a way

805
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:51,836
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

806
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:55,636
you know where is your attention going.

807
00:49:56,236 --> 00:50:00,396
And then you see the attention how it works.

808
00:50:01,156 --> 00:50:06,636
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

809
00:50:08,476 --> 00:50:12,636
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

810
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:16,076
how am I to give you certificate?

811
00:50:16,276 --> 00:50:19,189
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

812
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,185
Like they say you have graduated.

813
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:25,426
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

814
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:29,756
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

815
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,156
You are praveenas now.

816
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,396
"Praveen" means a master.

817
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:37,556
Use your mastery.

818
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:40,636
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

819
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:44,076
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

820
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:47,556
- you are a master.

821
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:52,116
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

822
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:56,076
is the master, you are also masters.

823
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,316
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

824
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:03,196
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

825
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:07,476
and brickbats and all that, rise!

826
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:16,876
The another great quality of Him is that

827
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:22,556
He uses His teeth to write.

828
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:27,236
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

829
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:32,396
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

830
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,996
So He uses the teeth to write.

831
00:51:36,316 --> 00:51:39,716
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

832
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:44,396
So it is said that you must use

833
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:49,316
your brain

834
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:53,756
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

835
00:51:54,076 --> 00:51:57,276
and write, write, and write,

836
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:02,516
and produce it into books.

837
00:52:02,836 --> 00:52:07,836
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

838
00:52:08,556 --> 00:52:11,836
And these books were read by people

839
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:14,116
and they were so much impressed,

840
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:18,196
because anything black and white becomes something great.

841
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:21,236
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

842
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:24,156
You can approach the televisions

843
00:52:24,356 --> 00:52:26,756
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

844
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:30,556
Now think about going in to people,

845
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:33,236
live in the society, live with them,

846
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:37,036
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

847
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:40,476
It's not only that but it is also,

848
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:44,436
it's a special privilege to you.

849
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:48,916
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

850
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:53,356
and I've tried to give you

851
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,876
some points about Shri Ganesh.

852
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:59,276
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

853
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,676
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

854
00:53:03,156 --> 00:53:06,636
So I hope you will understand the essential,

855
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:10,436
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

856
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:15,516
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

857
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:23,656
May God bless you all.
