1
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:20,560
I bow all the  seekers of spirit.

2
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:28,427
The seeking of spirit has been described

3
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,443
 by so many people from ancient times.

4
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:34,736
 It is nothing new that I’m telling you

5
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,106
 that a human awareness reaches a point

6
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:44,390
where it starts seeing that there has to be something beyond

7
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,508
and at that time  the seeking starts.

8
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,107
And the person starts looking forward to  something

9
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:54,577
 that will make that person the spirit,

10
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:00,743
as all this scriptures have described and talked about it.

11
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:06,261
There is no amount of talking is going to improve on that

12
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:11,520
because, spirit is within us it resides within us in our heart .

13
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,076
Now as it is you must have heard many people talking about it

14
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:20,676
 that you have to be spirit that

15
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:26,781
you have to get your self realization, 
you have to  have self knowledge you have to know yourself

16
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:32,051
but in Sahaja Yoga today what one has to do is to establish that

17
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:36,296
 to actualize that make it an experience of your own

18
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:40,296
and this is a very big gift I think a very unique discovery

19
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:43,902
 that has come to us that we can actualize.

20
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:46,567
 Now  we have to understand one simple think

21
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:49,413
 that when this spirit manifest within us,

22
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:53,828
what should happen on the very gross level what should happen.

23
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:56,751
Firstly it must be invigorated,

24
00:01:56,888 --> 00:02:00,138
means you must get more energy in the body,

25
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:03,408
You must feel physical limit.

26
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,973
By going to any process or any method or any experience

27
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,705
if health wise if you cannot improve then must know that it is not the spirit.

28
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,606
Because spirit is complete health,

29
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:21,145
or it never get sick, that is what Spirit is.

30
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,537
So first thing that should happen to you, is that

31
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,845
it should  be an invigorating life a very dynamic life.

32
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,503
Second thing that should happen to you is, that you become a very peaceful

33
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:37,612
and a relax personality, not like the ones who were agitated

34
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,832
 and very angry and shout.

35
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:45,093
There is nothing to shout and get angry its a kind of a fear this people have perhaps

36
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:49,183
 that if the truth they face, or the reality that comes

37
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:51,032
they will have no place in this world.

38
00:02:51,112 --> 00:02:55,187
That might be one of the reasons which makes them agitated.

39
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,441
A person  like Christ, about who people talk

40
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:02,668
and think that the Christ was, is in their pocket.

41
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,353
You must know that first and foremost thing the greatness of Christ

42
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:10,965
was that, He used a weapon of forgiveness.

43
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:14,137
 He was such a peaceful person, on the cross also

44
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,184
 that He said that forgive those

45
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:21,769
who are doing this O Father, 
because they do not know what they are doing.

46
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:26,944
That kind of a personality, you can say is a spiritual personality.

47
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,136
and not a person who gets agitated and hot tempered

48
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,077
 and start shouting at people.

49
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:38,054
The time today is extremely precarious, which we do not realize.

50
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:42,148
For example, if you ask these people if Christ comes and stands here

51
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:44,356
how will they recognize Christ?

52
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,381
Is there any way of recognizing Christ?

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,034
They might be those who crucified Christ,
 because they did not recognize at that time.

54
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:56,174
How we will recognize Christ, is a very simple question.

55
00:03:56,243 --> 00:03:58,136
 which we never try to answer.

56
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,868
There’s no way to understand how we are going to recognize Christ.

57
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:09,316
A very very simple question has no answer because you can't.

58
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,154
 You cannot recognize Him.

59
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,782
Because your awareness cannot make you understand.

60
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:18,786
Like somebody told me that there’s somebody who claims that he is Christ.

61
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:22,676
I said all right, ask him to  walk on the water.

62
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:28,874
If he can walk on the water then think that is Christ.
 That's one of the qualities of Christ

63
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:35,358
Now, whatever is the quality of a particular advent
is to be seen in that advent.

64
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:38,987
Every advent has a particular quality

65
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,089
which is being already described in the ancient books.

66
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:47,119
You should not accept anybody
because he says I'm this  and I'm that.

67
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,643
This is the problem with us, that we get ourselves value,

68
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:53,467
to some sort of mental conception live with  it,

69
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,626
our forefathers lived with it, their forefathers have lived with it

70
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,901
and ultimately we find there is nothing left.

71
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,555
So one has to know that when you,

72
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:08,369
at least when you say that you believe in Christ,

73
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,317
 how will you recognise if Christ comes.

74
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,962
Is there any matter?

75
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:16,681
Is there any shown matter that will tell you that He is Christ?

76
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:17,917
There is!

77
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:21,324
You should become the spirit. You have vibrations.

78
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,591
You feel coolness.

79
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,078
You have a new awareness a vibrated awareness, the fifth dimension

80
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:31,305
 within you rises into that point  by which, when you ask,

81
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:33,638
"Is this Christ?"

82
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:38,640
The vibrations will flow, tremendously.

83
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,372
You will know, this is Christ.

84
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:45,417
If he is  a fake person, you might even get blisters in your cap,

85
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:49,011
you might even get terrible heat from such a person.

86
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,112
But if it is Christ, you'll get tremendous breeze in your hand.

87
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:59,122
This is the sign how to make out whether he is Christ or not.

88
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:02,926
That’s why he said that you will be calling me Christ, Christ

89
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:08,080
I won’t recognize you, neither you will recognize Him.
That's a fact.

90
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,961
You live with an idea with a mental projection

91
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:15,043
and then you came all your

92
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:19,787
possibilities, chances of your ascent.

93
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:23,509
You must keep yourself open like a scientist  does,

94
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:27,126
keep yourself open. Your mind should be open.

95
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:30,091
 You should not close down by any dogma

96
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:34,011
or any time off such theory that makes you

97
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:40,052
 completely excluded from the rest of the thing,

98
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:43,257
 or which makes you non reflect,

99
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:46,705
 which makes you a person who cannot reflect,

100
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,701
cannot think anymore about.

101
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:57,143
Such a personality who developed,
which is going to be very, very dangerous for you.

102
00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:01,248
So the personality should be open,

103
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:06,412
should be receptive you understand.

104
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:10,517
 Now, as I told you yesterday back it is a spontaneous happening

105
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:14,150
 is the happening off the living process within you.

106
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:17,155
It is nothing to do with artifical things.

107
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:21,599
Of course in the churches were established
they try to be good to people in the sense

108
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:25,039
they told them that to be in the balance
you keep the balance another

109
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:29,372
but it went too far with certain things like baptism, I think

110
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,585
that where they everybody started putting their hands

111
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:36,845
on top of anyone I'm said that your baptised

112
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:39,469
that's not proper

113
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:42,863
but you call [....Hindi] means it is unauthorized.

114
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:46,111
To baptize someone is not the authority

115
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,082
that you can get from any school colleges
but you have to get it from God.

116
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,658
If you are a realized soul then you can baptize others.

117
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:58,482
Everybody cannot baptize, everyone.

118
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,978
Even, I don't think Christ disciples baptize anyone, they did not.

119
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,931
It is later on, I don't know how it croul

120
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,458
into the organization, that you could ask somebody
to go and baptize someone.

121
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:14,442
William Blake has clearly said,

122
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,123
that the priest cursed me on my head and I cried and wept.

123
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:22,467
 Actually, that person who has to baptize,

124
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,371
 has to be realized soul

125
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,302
because, baptism means awakening of the Kundalini

126
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:31,107
and breaking up this fontanel bone area

127
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:36,853
open to the subtle and that
you cannot do it, so you better not do it.

128
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,630
You are unauthorized.

129
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:45,618
in all humbleness and humility one 
must understand that that is not your job.

130
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:51,887
Say for example, I do not know anything about the machinery,

131
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,012
or about a car

132
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:56,598
I start driving, what will happen?

133
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,804
 But same thing happens with people who do not have the authority

134
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,674
to do God's work, start doing God's work.

135
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:08,354
they lang everybody into difficulties,
and ultimately they neutralize themselves.

136
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:11,345
It is high time for all of them now to see,

137
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,447
that what they have to do, all these institutions, is no dogma

138
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:19,305
nothing like that, but what you have to do

139
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:23,562
is to transform people through their Kundalini awakening.

140
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,666
through their real baptism.

141
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,280
This is what people have realized

142
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:34,521
that there’s something wrong somewhere
that we are not connected to the mains.

143
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,697
When it happens, the first thing that happens to you

144
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,320
that you become collectively conscious as

145
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,562
Warren has told.

146
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,250
this collectively consciousness is nothing but

147
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,090
that your attention itself, your attention which is felt

148
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:52,550
on the central nervous system gets enlightened.

149
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:57,760
in the sense that as like ether, when you touch ether

150
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:02,175
you can communicate anything from here to every place.

151
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:08,417
In the same way, when you touch that All Pervading Power

152
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,114
you can communicate through that power,

153
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:17,160
anywhere sitting down, it is collectively conscious.

154
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,524
Moreover collectively conscious means that, you can feel a person

155
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,178
whether he is the person he is

156
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:29,099
allright or he has a problem or his...

157
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:32,844
Kundalini is in this part of the body or

158
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,180
if he has got some disease,

159
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,445
you can feel also about yourself.

160
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,999
That’s the sign of light,

161
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:42,207
that you automatically feel how the person is.

162
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,461
You may not of [INAUDABLE] a meeting

163
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:48,351
say it loudly or you may not try to inform the person

164
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:53,170
the other lady came to me and she was,
she was having cancer no doubt.

165
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:57,753
But I didn't tell him, I tried and I think now she is cured.

166
00:10:57,982 --> 00:10:59,944
So, you don’t have to tell a person

167
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,370
because you don’t have to achieve anything by telling,

168
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:05,201
what you have to do is to achieve if she can be all right

169
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:07,003
if you can give them realization.

170
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:10,322
But your attitude is not to cure people.

171
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:12,341
That's not the attitude of the Divine.

172
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:14,122
Because it has got common sense.

173
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,173
If you know that a certain car is going to be a junk forever,

174
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:22,060
it is of no use, you don’t repair such cars.

175
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:26,517
So, despite the affection and compassion you have for everyone,

176
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,165
you want to see that by giving realization to this man

177
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,405
who is absolutely good for nothing and all that

178
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:38,205
you are just doing, throwing pearls before him.

179
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:42,787
So you don’t even want to talk to such a man about realization,

180
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,594
leave alone giving realization.

181
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:48,497
This is such a headache to give realization to a man

182
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,972
who is absolutely against God.

183
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:55,028
Like Hitler for example, if he says that
"Mother, give me realization."

184
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,516
What should I do?

185
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,425
It is just like that.

186
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:03,763
So you have to have basically a temprament of seek.

187
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:06,963
If you are a seeker, then you get your realization

188
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:10,376
and you become collectively conscious.

189
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:16,292
With collective consciousness
you can also raise the Kundalini of people.

190
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,809
You can cure.

191
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,444
You can mentally improve them.

192
00:12:21,637 --> 00:12:24,078
You can settle them with peace.

193
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:26,751
Then sitting down here,

194
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,592
you can tell about everyone, what’s wrong with that person,

195
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,780
and sitting down here, you can try to help others.

196
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,131
 It is not a difficult thing at all, because you become that.

197
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,260
Like, you have seen a television.

198
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:46,385
if it puts to the mains,
it start acting in such a fantastic manner,

199
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:51,145
that nobody can believe that this little box can behave like this.

200
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:55,750
In the same way this little box start
behaving in that fantastic manner.

201
00:12:55,868 --> 00:13:01,266
This should happen to you, otherwise
you should not believe that you have got realization.

202
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,354
It is not a 'make believe' thing.

203
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,056
It is not just a mental understanding,

204
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,884
that you are twice born, it is none of these things.

205
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,460
It is something that has sprouted within you, which has to

206
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,290
If you are lower [INAUDABLE]

207
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,657
and if you really respect yourself,

208
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:20,141
as people seeking the truth and nothing else,

209
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:24,175
it happens to you, and grow completely in your growing.

210
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:32,925
Secondly, what happens to you is that
you start understanding that it is the truth. How?

211
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:36,224
Because supposing there were, as I told you,

212
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,805
that there was a gentleman whose father was sick,

213
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,984
and we did not know about it.
He wanted to know about his father.

214
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:46,649
So I said, all right.
Put your hands and ask how is your father.

215
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:51,670
He just asked his father and got
a burning sensation on this finger here.

216
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:57,592
So he asked Me, so I called it,
I said this finger relates to this portion,

217
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,191
and these are the center’s of your father.

218
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,912
If it is so, then you better ask your father

219
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,237
but I’m sure he must be down with very bad bronchitis.

220
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,742
He telephoned to his mother in Scotland

221
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:15,862
because she came on the phone and she said,
your father is down with very bad bronchitis.

222
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:19,321
Sitting down there, I told him how you can cure him,

223
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:23,896
and after that four,five hours he was out.

224
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:25,488
It can be done.

225
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:28,565
You are that fantastic, you are that glories.

226
00:14:28,663 --> 00:14:31,440
So your attention becomes enlightened.

227
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:36,714
There is no question of you trying to put some spirits into things

228
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,841
and do all these useless things.

229
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:43,517
Only thing you have to do is, to awaken the spirit in that person

230
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,755
who is sick and the spirit takes over.

231
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:51,609
Because it becomes also the truth.

232
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:55,103
You start understanding that this the truth.

233
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,680
Because you verified.

234
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,960
Every moment, you verify.

235
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,557
First the thing it's a fluke.

236
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,481
Sometimes you think by chance,

237
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:08,913
you think, "Oh maybe so", like later on, start seeing

238
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:11,080
that it is true. It is so.

239
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:15,224
You put ten children, if they are realized souls
and there are many these days,

240
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:19,374
even in your country, we have seen lots of children
who are born realized.

241
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,664
You should tie up their eyes and put one person in front of them

242
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,349
and you asked them, "What’s the matter with this man?"
you tell us what's the thing.

243
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:32,133
They raise one finger, this finger, supposing.

244
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,582
You asking, "Did you have a heart attack?"
This shows the heart.

245
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,543
"Yes I have. How do?" I said,
"All of them are showing one finger. This is the heart."

246
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:45,281
And then you start understanding that, this is the truth.

247
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:51,569
There is no argument, there is no other opinion about it,

248
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:55,803
only one opinion, because truth is absolute!

249
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,132
Somebody says, this is Christ, somebody says that is Christ,

250
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:01,671
somebody says this is Krishna, that is Rama.

251
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,531
It is never like that!

252
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:07,722
It is one. The truth is one, you cannot have two opinion.

253
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:13,926
And is absolutely your subject, becomes enlightened
and  you can say this is the truth.

254
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:20,086
So the second thing that happens to you,
that you start knowing the truth, which is absolute.

255
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,843
Now, if you put your hands say like this.

256
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,140
now, as you have become and a computer,

257
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,543
you are a computer, which has starting.

258
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,776
Even all these instruments that have come
are parallel to our evolution.

259
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:35,061
Whatever is within us, has come.

260
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,399
But, if you see a computer,

261
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,776
it has to think. But without thinking,

262
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:45,795
I mean, I look at you, I know you are there.
I don’t have a think about it.

263
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,744
This kind of a computer

264
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,443
human beings will take thousands of years,
even to make

265
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:53,530
that just thinks and spontaneously knows.

266
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:56,470
We are already such a big computer, but

267
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:00,076
we are even become absolute computers, when

268
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,986
we start asking a question, "Is there God?"

269
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,250
Now those who are atheist, if they ask the question,

270
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,692
they start getting cool breeze on the hands.

271
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:13,034
You ask any absolute question, "Was Christ the son of God?"

272
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,028
Why should people accept Bible?

273
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,677
Why should they accept anything?
The accept this.

274
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:23,288
Because if you ask, you get the breeze,
cool breeze in the hands as an answer.

275
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:25,292
Then you know it as a truth.

276
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:28,733
But could be, people should know that, how is it absolute?

277
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,862
I’ll tell you an example like us we have some fanatics here
in India we also have lots of fanatics.

278
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:38,022
and in Pune they have arranged my program in a hall

279
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:42,601
where, which was belonging to brahmins
they another type of

280
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,982
twice born people. Self certified.

281
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:50,000
So, they learned that I’m not a brahmin.

282
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,664
So they were very angry and said,"We can not have your program."

283
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:59,323
And our, these organizers did not tell me that
"Mother they don’t want to have your program,

284
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,595
because you are not a brahmin." nothing they told me.

285
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:06,360
But  they went and told that, "All right. If you don’t want
to have will publish it in the newspaper, because

286
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,127
Mataji is not a brahmin,

287
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,722
so they don’t want to have the program there."

288
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,164
This was too much for them, to take upon themselves,

289
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:17,085
So they said, "No, no, no, no. If you have published
it in the newspaper, let's have the program."

290
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,780
So I said, "I start the speaking",

291
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:22,132
and I just say spontaneously

292
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:27,103
I said, "Please come forward those who are boothing that
the real brahmins."

293
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,798
Four, five of them, you see walked.

294
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:34,317
Of course, I mean, in India you don’t find
people of this kind, normally.

295
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,465
They don’t challenge a seat normally.

296
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:41,517
So they came forward and sat down
and their hands where shaking, like this. You see.

297
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:45,483
So I said,"Now, if you are real brahmins,why are you shaking?"

298
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,171
"You should not shake before Me."

299
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,668
They said, "Mother we are shaking because you are Shakti,
You are the power."

300
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,104
"That's why we are shaking."

301
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,133
I said, "No, nobody is shaking here."

302
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:57,245
So they said, "No, but these three, four are shaking,
who are they?"

303
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,678
I said, "Go and ask them. Who are they?"

304
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,745
So, they went and asked, "Who are you?"

305
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:05,684
They said, "We are certified lunatics, coming from lunatic asylum,

306
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,226
our doctor has brought us

307
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:10,387
that because one of us was cured by Mataji,
so we are here."

308
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,851
Let's us see. There is no difference between those
lunatics and you.

309
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:16,916
You’re shaking the same way and they’re also shaking.

310
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,175
So, this fanaticism is making you shake.

311
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:28,477
And this is the main point is, that when you become the truth,

312
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:31,721
you start understanding the absolute nature of truth.

313
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,905
There is no another, for truth.

314
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:38,798
If this is so, this is so. If this is so, this is so.

315
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:40,737
You cannot compromise.

316
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:44,026
You cannot make it little different,

317
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:45,887
you cannot synthesize it.

318
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:50,638
You cannot analyze it. It is so, it is so, it is so.

319
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,926
And you get confirmed about it, when you

320
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:57,953
growing in your awarness,
you start finding out that this is the truth.

321
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:03,569
So, you understand the truth through your mental activity first,

322
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:07,908
through your rationality is goes in to your logic
and then you start accept it.

323
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:12,005
But third thing that happens to you, ist the best of all.

324
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:16,740
Is the third thing that you see the whole world as fun.

325
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,842
You see the whole world as a big joke.

326
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:23,116
You see the whole world as a witness.

327
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:25,873
Like a thougth rises within us and falls off,

328
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:28,044
and another thought rises and falls off.

329
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,181
When we are on the waves of the thought,

330
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,540
we are frighten, we have fear, we have worries,
we have jealousies and all these things.

331
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,108
But supposing you get into the boat,

332
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,214
then you start watching waves with fun.

333
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:44,075
in the same way, you jump onto such an awareness

334
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:48,127
where you start watching the whole thing as a joke.

335
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,424
As a fun, as a play.

336
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:54,045
And the whole thing becomes a play to your mind, you start seeing.

337
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,164
And then the joy, stars pouring in you.

338
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:01,684
Like you all say that, Mona Lisa painting is very good.

339
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:03,202
How do you know?

340
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,267
Why should wait about Mona Lisa?

341
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:09,581
She is not one of these modern women.

342
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:14,015
She is a very old fashioned woman, quite plump.

343
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:17,763
And why do you say that that painting is so beautiful?
What is so much about it?

344
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:22,047
Now, if you are a realized soul, you can see it gives vibrations.

345
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,361
It soothes your Spirit.

346
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,259
That's why, it is the best.

347
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,284
If you go to the Sistine Chapel,

348
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,606
of the Vatican.

349
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:36,451
What Michelangelo has done is nothing,
but he has created vibrations,

350
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:38,352
tremendous vibrations.

351
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,831
And you see Christ, how they are show Christ?

352
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:43,083
A robust, tall

353
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,034
fellow standing there, throwing people here and there.

354
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,058
This is, what is happen today.

355
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,999
This is the time of judgement.

356
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,064
and the whole thing is nothing but the Kundalini they've shown,
and at agnya chakra

357
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:57,759
Christ is sierving there and throwing people
this side and that side.

358
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,770
This is what it is. He is depicted there

359
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:03,939
through His own understanding, because was a realized soul.

360
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:05,504
He shows it very clearly.

361
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,814
But then on the altar you find a lanky panky

362
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:12,777
Christ, you see, absolutely like a TV  patient about to die,

363
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:17,988
only the bones, you see covered with the what you call a skin.

364
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:22,174
How can Christ be like that! Is silly [INAUDABLE] .

365
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:25,768
Like these people who try onces to carry the cross.

366
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:28,501
And they will know that He could no be like that.

367
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:32,111
He could not be such a lanky panky. He is a Person of Joy,

368
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:35,855
health, happiness and exuberance.

369
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:40,839
How can be anyone who is a man of God, is sickly,

370
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:51,017
agitated, hot temper and horrible looking.
He has to have that serene on his face.

371
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:58,535
He has to have that beautiful soothing, impression on others.

372
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:06,521
How can it be that a person who is such a
great incarnation came on this earth

373
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,436
to be a bony structure like that?

374
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,002
This is what it is.

375
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:15,592
We have such misconceptions about all of them, such misconceptions,

376
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,667
and we want to put all this conception on God,

377
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:21,050
but you cannot conceptualize.

378
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:27,106
The thing that stands between you and yourself is your ego,

379
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:32,318
an your conditiion. Both things stand against, theiy are like barriers.

380
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:36,974
When this Kundalini rises, as you see here. Is not here.

381
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:42,010
When she rises and crosses over this center.
(Yogi: I didnt put a chart...)

382
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:49,510
Then what happens your ego and superego,
it represents your conditioning, is sucked in.

383
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:55,398
When it is sucked in, that is the, that is the center of Christ,
when is awaken within you,

384
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,846
He sucks in. That's the place where He is at the cross.
Tomorrow,

385
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:03,596
I think they’ll bring the chart and I'll be able
to explain in more details.

386
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:10,856
And that is the time when you are neither the ego nor the superego
and you become the self. The joy starts singing [INAUDABLE].

387
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,880
Whole thing is joy.

388
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,424
The joy starts coming in you.

389
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:18,627
The all other pursuits are joyous.

390
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:21,422
There is no joy in the whole things,

391
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:27,069
and joy doesn't have duality like happiness or unhappiness.

392
00:24:27,237 --> 00:24:29,943
Happiness comes to you when your ego is pampered.

393
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:33,987
And unhappiness comes to you, 
when your conditionings troubles you.

394
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,741
But, joy has no duality.

395
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:41,983
It's just a feeling of complete elevated soul.

396
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:48,450
You feel completely elevated about everything else,
enjoy the bliss of God.

397
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,749
Actually, if you see, I mean

398
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
Mona Lisa's painting even

399
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:55,950
you feel the joy is pouring, just like torrential rain.

400
00:24:56,318 --> 00:25:02,980
The person who did it, must have been the one
who has felt that joy, has broughten.

401
00:25:03,322 --> 00:25:08,218
But, if there is a person who is always thinking,

402
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:13,192
and trying to think it out, what should be done.

403
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:21,636
Then, he doesn't get the joy at all.
You look at a thing, and there is a thought in between.

404
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:23,545
It kills the joy completely.

405
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:28,286
Supposing I am here and I see something beautiful here,
and I start thinking about it,

406
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:31,362
then I start thinking, "How much it must have cost,

407
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:35,666
how to insure it. What to do with it", but there is no thought.

408
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:39,981
The complete creation of that beauty, flows inside you.

409
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,216
Just like joy.

410
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:45,393
And this is, what has to happen to you, if you become the spirit.

411
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,147
If it does not happen to you, don't believe in anyone.
Also me.

412
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,170
You should not beleive,

413
00:25:52,326 --> 00:25:57,987
into anything, unless and until you get your spirit
which manifest all this things.

414
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:02,824
It has nothing to do with your intellectualizing, your
your analyses, or anything.

415
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,956
It is something that you have within yourself. It's your own.

416
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:12,813
It is within you, and you have to get it within yourself,
by your own achievements.

417
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:17,871
In the sense your own Kundalini rises and touches here
and opens it out.

418
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:21,669
Now, as I told you, what I do is a simple thing.

419
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:29,257
That I enlighten and alight, which is ready

420
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:33,810
which is a, which is again in turn, becomes enlightened

421
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:36,067
and can enlighten other light.

422
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,039
Now, this Dr. Warren who was here, you have seen.

423
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:41,288
He came to Me with his friend.

424
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:45,226
and he just telephoned to Me, had nothing,
had just the telephone number.

425
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,842
and when he telephoned to Me, he came to Me,
he got his realisation

426
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:52,980
and he must have given realization in thousands.

427
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:57,006
In the same way, you can also give realization to people.

428
00:26:57,268 --> 00:27:00,531
That’s how we can spread the knowledge,

429
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,155
that is reality.

430
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,871
knowledge of God's law's,

431
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:14,168
of Divine mechanism within us, how it works.

432
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:21,300
It is not, that everyone can get it.

433
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:26,224
I must say that, that I do not say that
all off you will get it.

434
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:32,319
But should get it. That's my desire is, if you get it,
you're very fortunate

435
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:36,030
you have found, what you have been finding it.

436
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:40,906
And if you don’t get it, I would say that I'll try again.

437
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:44,547
It has to happen to you,

438
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,773
and that, it should happen in a way

439
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:54,740
that it becomes part and parcel of your central nervous system
that you can manouver it.

440
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,396
So, I have to tell you one thing. The One who has created us,

441
00:28:00,534 --> 00:28:05,457
is anxious that you enter into His Kingdom,

442
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:08,396
and enjoy the bliss of His truth.

443
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,676
May God bless you. I would like you

444
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:14,663
to ask me questions. But not like the way yesterday it happened.

445
00:28:14,766 --> 00:28:18,347
People said that,"Mother don't ask to him to ask questions,
because as soon as

446
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:22,541
they, you asked them to ask questions,
they start behaving like devils."

447
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:25,232
There is no need to be aggressive with Me.

448
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:28,457
What is the need? I have come here to give, what is your own.

449
00:28:28,528 --> 00:28:33,870
Why should you be angry with me?
I just don't understand, the psychology.

450
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,334
I have not come to take away anything from you.
(Yogi: I think they are outside

451
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:42,195
Yogi: They are not in here)
All right. Ask your questions please.

452
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:48,471
(Someone is asking a question to Shri Mataji. But it's not clear.)

453
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,775
What is he say?

454
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,512
He said, just just a moment, he said that,

455
00:29:07,647 --> 00:29:11,934
as you have said, [INAUDABLE]  universal and

456
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:16,998
that it is reality, but everybody is concept
the reality may be different.

457
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,982
Yes, it is so. I know that.

458
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:23,828
It is too, that the concept has to be different, isn't it?

459
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:26,863
Has to be different because

460
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:32,595
everybody has their own brain,
to understand, and thinking to their brain.

461
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:35,149
But when you become the reality,

462
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,070
then there is no more concept, this reality is sucked.

463
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:45,585
Because you start working through your consciousness,
through your central nerves system.

464
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:49,940
It is no more a concept, it becomes the reality itself.

465
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:56,174
That's true that it has to be different,
naturally, I understand that.

466
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:59,394
I don't mind having them different concept,

467
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:03,627
but, don’t believe in your concept.
Because it has given no results.

468
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:09,404
It has shown no result so far, that's all.

469
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,887
Yogi: Concept is dissolved.

470
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:18,041
Concept is dissolved. Yes that is what's happened,
concept is dissolved. This is the reality.

471
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:21,187
For example supposing, I'm not  seeing this

472
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:24,477
church and some people say that's in a church

473
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:28,163
I may have some funny concept about church.
I have not seen it. All right?

474
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:34,781
when I come and I see it for myself, and I know this it is so.
I have no concept, I know what it is, it’s like that.

475
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:39,766
Simple, very it's common sense,
I tell you, it is really common sense.

476
00:30:39,979 --> 00:30:43,497
Actually will be shocked how people live in concepts.

477
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:47,727
Sometimes i'm really surprised how they are build upon their

478
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,918
lives after  lives of  falsehood.

479
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:57,510
It's a really surprising, but they live
because you see, ego likes the myth.

480
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,482
It wants to live with myth.

481
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:03,278
Like Hitler believing that they are superior race. Imagine.

482
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:08,104
He kill millions and millions of people with that kind
of a myth that he had in his head

483
00:31:08,223 --> 00:31:13,627
Like so many thinks he is the greatest religious man in that God,
it's going to put him in his throne

484
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,442
It’s true, you see. You see the effects
of this concepts everywhere.

485
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:25,310
The problem is, the concept only

486
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,556
that's the main problem why we're fighting.

487
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,075
Now, see. Let one by one, right please.

488
00:31:33,232 --> 00:31:37,512
Now, who? One this side, one this side.

489
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:48,242
"He’s asking you to speak about the love and compassion
of the divine Mother. And her qualities."

490
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:51,134
Now, This is embarassing. Isn't it?

491
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:54,712
How can a Mother talk about her love?

492
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:58,134
You can judging by the Mother Earth.

493
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,209
Mother Earth has the capacity, who nourishes.

494
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:06,096
She has a capacity to soothe us.

495
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:10,513
She has a capacity, to sustain all that we do,

496
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,596
how cruel we have been with her.

497
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:17,486
First of all, we commit all kinds of sins, we do all kind of
wrong things on her back.

498
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,486
Then we extract.

499
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:26,993
For our stupid ideas of having all kinds of things of extracting.

500
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,951
Still, she doesn't say anything.

501
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:32,945
She doesn't bother about those things.

502
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,791
But sometimes if you go to far with her,
then she punishes.

503
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:41,112
She does punishes. Like you have earthquakes,
you have  many things like that.

504
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,807
But she has a very special capacity,

505
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:47,438
which is in Sanskrit described as the "Tambara".

506
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:51,222
Means, by which she creates seasons to please us.

507
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,825
To make us happy. That innocence,

508
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,203
creation of seasons that she has. You see the flowers,
you see the everything

509
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:04,382
how she makes a life so beautiful humanes, so joyful.

510
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:10,372
That thing is 'pragya' means the knowledge which is enlightened.
When you get that knowledge,

511
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:14,268
then you are amazed how [INAUDABLE]  she is.

512
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:17,628
How she looks after little, little,

513
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,551
and how she soothes.

514
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:26,477
And I do quite some thimes [INAUDABLE]  how I try to console people.

515
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,360
In my own symbol.

516
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:33,869
One day,there is a very great saint living in a mountain

517
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:37,533
who I think, his legs and hands are broken and all disappear

518
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,594
he lives in a cave, some like a monch.

519
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:45,440
And, he can not move, so got a tiger so he can move.

520
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:49,189
And I told the people I must see him, he is my son.

521
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:53,096
They said " Mother, you don't like these gurus. 
Why you want to see him?

522
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:55,033
That time, he is real one.

523
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:58,288
They said, "How will you ??",
I said, "Feel his vibrations."

524
00:33:58,415 --> 00:34:01,942
They said "Yes, lot's of vibrations."
I went to see this gentlemen.

525
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:07,580
Now, he is a very evolve personality
and he can control the rain.

526
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:12,924
So when I was going up the hill, it started raining heavily

527
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,616
and he was very angry with the rain.

528
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,928
Actually he felt that, "Whats happen, this rain is

529
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,136
completely drenching my Mother.

530
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:24,058
She is coming up, and I can't even control this rain.

531
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,960
What will she think. I sit here and she has to come up to see me."

532
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:30,178
Because, he has broken legs and broken hands.

533
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,367
And when I went to talk to him, He was sitting

534
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:37,102
on a little stone and just doing like this, with anger.

535
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:39,850
So, I just smiled at him and sat.

536
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:46,244
Then he came, he said, "Is it that you control my ego, 
who did all this that you make

537
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:52,039
 this place like this. You come to my house 
and I can not welcome you properly?"

538
00:34:52,178 --> 00:34:55,395
I said, "No at all, why you get angry?

539
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:58,177
I know you have bought a sari for Me,

540
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:03,919
and I don't take a sari from a sanyasi,
becouse I'm [INAUDABLE] , I'm the one who has a household.

541
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:07,823
Then how will I get a sari
unless and untill this sari is not drenched.?"

542
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,533
The whole thing become such a sweet thing. Really.

543
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,806
He forgot his all temper and everything.

544
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,038
"How do you know Mother, I have a sari for you?"

545
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:19,986
"I know you bought a sari for Me,
so I have to change it and how will I change"

546
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:24,299
So, the whole thing soothe down and he was normal.
But I said [INAUDABLE] .

547
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:30,018
I'm permeating, and the whole place must be drenched.
This is, is the joy of loving.

548
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:34,549
So, why you should felle bad about it?
And that is how you soothe down.

549
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:38,987
So, the mothers love is such, that She

550
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:41,448
soothes you, she knows your problems,

551
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,653
she knows that you make mistakes.

552
00:35:43,832 --> 00:35:46,395
Like, I tell you about Mr. Warren,

553
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:50,200
one of his stories. When he ..... he can tell one after another.

554
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,879
One day, I was in Singapore
and we are going to have a program.

555
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:59,114
So, I said, "We go about six o clock.
It's all right becouse I have to see somebody

556
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,896
Why do you have to go

557
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,598
They said, "No, no, we must go make arrangements
another lady who was organising even very much more worried.

558
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:09,570
So, they have decided, we must go to the hall.

559
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:14,504
I said, "I'm go out and wait for [INAUDABLE] ."
But they just thought, better go.

560
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,672
So, they took a

561
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:21,753
plane two hours earlier and went to the place of organizing.

562
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:30,351
When, I were there, I saw that when my car
reached there, their car also reached there they just came down at that time

563
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:32,006
And I knew why it happened,

564
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:35,092
I said, "All right come drive a but, they feel very embarrassing"

565
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:37,027
Becouse they came with such a

566
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:41,722
determination that they have to reach there,
and same time I arrived there.

567
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,691
So, I went draw walk, when I came back

568
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,582
they said, "Mother we are sorry."

569
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,083
I said, "What happen?

570
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:52,228
They said,"We reached there, all right.

571
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:56,955
but from the airport to this place,
there was such a bad jam, they have never see.

572
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,580
So, we thought we better drive through the

573
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:03,025
sideway, so we got stucked into the mud.

574
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:05,830
Then we start pulling the car out.

575
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:09,228
and all our clothes were dirty,
then we had a very bad time.

576
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,189
And we have arrived, after You have arrived.

577
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,767
I said, "It's all right."

578
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:18,259
Now, we never do such a thing Mother,
we should have coming with you. It was a mistake.

579
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,863
So, like that litle little things

580
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:23,213
Mother teaches you, how to be

581
00:37:23,378 --> 00:37:25,488
all right, how to be on the right path.

582
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:30,495
But it is never a big pinch, never a big
punishment. Because you are children.

583
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:33,774
So, here this life by which
you should advanced

584
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,163
you should go further, you should be encouraged.

585
00:37:36,265 --> 00:37:41,805
But if you ego get's pampered, and you think
I am a great Sahaja Yogi. There are many who behaving like that

586
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,852
And then they have this correction point.

587
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:50,641
That's how it works out. And gradually I find,
people come up very sweetly understanding

588
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:53,735
that we should not try to

589
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:57,712
do things which are no all right.
And we should try to do something

590
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,860
that is helpful, which is very collective.

591
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:03,345
And that's what it is, and it works in a such a beatiful manner

592
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:08,813
that you don't have to should to anyone,
or to do anything. Whole thing works out beautifully.

593
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:14,028
The blessings are so great like Krishna has said (in Hindi)

594
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:16,450
He says, when yoga takes place

595
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,084
then, "kshema" - that means

596
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:23,021
the well-being of a person [INAUDABLE] .

597
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,138
Even material you are [INAUDABLE] .

598
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:28,234
in so many ways. Is very suprising, is [INAUDABLE] .

599
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:34,524
You are helped in material in so many ways. There was a girl,
a little girl about ten years. She wrote to Me,

600
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,987
But I am dying to see you.
How can I come to India, I have no money to travel

601
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,444
And she wrote a letter to Me.
I just get the letter and I didn't answered her.

602
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,997
And eight years later she had a field day

603
00:38:46,161 --> 00:38:49,471
in her school. So she took a trinket from her house

604
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:54,369
just to sell it in the field. So the teachers said,
"This is real gold, how can you sell this here?"

605
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:57,229
She couldn't believe.
She went to her mother, she said

606
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:00,981
This trinket of our house, is real gold.
She couldn't believe either

607
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,568
So they wen to the goldsmith,
and goldsmith said "Yes, it is."

608
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:06,936
It is gold.

609
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:15,817
And he valued with the price which he wanted to buy was exactly
the same as they would have to pay for their travel both of them.

610
00:39:16,551 --> 00:39:19,200
So, it is in such a sweet manner.

611
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:23,043
You see, you must know, a loving mother
when you are asleep

612
00:39:23,168 --> 00:39:24,787
she looks after you.

613
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,982
When you awake, she looks after you.

614
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:31,794
But she doesn't show that you are someting

615
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,294
more then others,

616
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:36,826
better then others. She doesn't like
you to have your ego.

617
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,755
but she wants that you to share.

618
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:40,841
Share your love with everyone.

619
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,221
That's the greates joy for Me
to see when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other.

620
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:48,126
When they would, you should see

621
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,205
How they  meet and

622
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:55,008
how they hold each other to themselves.
Just pure love and pure understanding.

623
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:56,682
Is the greatest thing to see.

624
00:39:56,784 --> 00:39:58,684
I'm happyyou asked such a nice question

625
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:04,787
but I feel rather embarassed, because
it is realy so great to enjoy your love from everyone.

626
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:06,896
May God bless you.

627
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:10,618
Yogi: this fire by Adi Shankara...

628
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:20,976
Ah, you must read Adi Shankaracharya to know the love of God, 
love of Mother. I mean he was a child, a beautiful child.

629
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:25,647
Even Christ has said, "behold the mother".

630
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,975
Behold the mother.

631
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,897
It's very significant.

632
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:36,076
Is water in this.

633
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:45,314
Should have a Realization.

634
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:50,203
Yogi: Ok. So we have it now?

635
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:54,515
Have I answered your all questions, this side?

636
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:58,858
Just on,  All right.

637
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:05,059
Loudly please.

638
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:06,703
Yogi: loudly!

639
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:41,370
Yogi: She's refereing to the, how you said

640
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,222
how you would you recognise Christ you referd to that.

641
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,636
So she raises the question,

642
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:49,831
what is your idea, your theorie

643
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:55,095
your concept on Christ, will he be coming on a white horse

644
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,520
is he going to come and is this going to happen.

645
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,984
Yes, this is going to happen. No doubt!

646
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:03,836
[INAUDABLE]  that's a fact.

647
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:08,126
Yes, but that doesn't going to give any [INAUDABLE].

648
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:11,142
He's not going to ask you any questions.

649
00:42:11,392 --> 00:42:13,407
He's not to going to give any answer.

650
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:18,305
No realization, nothing. Just [INAUDABLE]

651
00:42:18,423 --> 00:42:21,194
He has eleven powers of destruction

652
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:24,524
is called as ekadesha. Once he arrives

653
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:29,087
you will have no place to hide your faces if you are [INAUDABLE]

654
00:42:29,138 --> 00:42:32,058
[UNCLEAR]  ....right now

655
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:34,784
at this moment.

656
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:39,877
Otherwise [INAUDABLE]  . Is a fact, no doubt. [INAUDABLE]

657
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:45,743
[UNCLEAR]

658
00:42:48,563 --> 00:42:53,941
Becouse that's what you ???
I don't want to ??? It's a fact.

659
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:02,005
That will be last [INAUDABLE]

660
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:08,862
Already he has startet working in us

661
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:12,589
All [INAUDABLE]  are also what Krishna has said

662
00:43:13,074 --> 00:43:18,991
According to Sahaja Yoga there are eleven destroying powers.

663
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,975
They are here, which we call as ekadesha rudra.

664
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:30,747
And when people get any [INAUDABLE]  disease, all this centers [INAUDABLE] .

665
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:36,210
So, the destruciton now [INAUDABLE].

666
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:40,614
You did not get [INAUDABLE] .

667
00:43:46,716 --> 00:43:53,263
Yogi: One more and this is the last. Yes

668
00:43:54,505 --> 00:44:02,264
a visitor is asking a question, but it is not audible

669
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,352
Yogi: I'm sorry, I can't...
would you please stand and just say it again.

670
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:27,476
Shri Mataji: Make it short.
Yogi: make it briefly.

671
00:44:31,984 --> 00:44:34,760
Yogi: the idea of [INAUDABLE].

672
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,720
that one soul [INAUDABLE]  another soul

673
00:44:37,954 --> 00:44:42,673
Visitor: not clear

674
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,161
Yogi: I think you have a, another concept about healing

675
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:59,984
but let's finalise it

676
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:08,091
Yogi: She is talking about a healing process, and
is there any particular way, we should do this.

677
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:12,045
No, no. You should never bother about the source

678
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:13,354
[INAUDABLE]

679
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:19,089
Christ has said that, leave
them alone they have nothing to do with [INAUDABLE]

680
00:45:19,543 --> 00:45:23,278
Living souls you would say, or death souls?

681
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:25,000
Yogi: living

682
00:45:25,185 --> 00:45:31,675
living. Now the living soul,
they not talk to another soul unless there [INAUDABLE]  spirit.

683
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:37,626
At that level you need to speek
to each other on a very different language.

684
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:40,442
The language is different, the style is different

685
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,005
and the communication is different.
The whole priority changes.

686
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,130
You become a different person.

687
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:47,622
All right?

688
00:45:48,294 --> 00:45:54,273
That the egg becomes a bird, and
the birds have a different language among themselves.

689
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:56,016
Yogi: That's fine she's happy.

690
00:45:56,125 --> 00:46:00,289
She's happy about it. All right.

691
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,453
All right.
Yogi: Ok, that's it Mother.

692
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:08,406
All right, are you all satisfied?

693
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:11,844
Now, just one or two more. All right.

694
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:14,609
Four, ah that for me...
Yogi: One of the men.

695
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,541
All right. [INAUDABLE]

696
00:46:17,738 --> 00:46:22,248
Question: What is a death soul?
It just acts as a death soul or living soul?

697
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:24,271
What did he say?

698
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:28,544
Yogi: What if a death soul is acting like a living soul?

699
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:32,864
Oh, it's a very big question my child.

700
00:46:32,935 --> 00:46:37,427
I'll tell you later on, after the program. All right.
It [INAUDABLE]  my lecture. Doesn't matter.

701
00:46:37,552 --> 00:46:38,748
[INAUDABLE]

702
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:44,210
We are made of [INAUDABLE], all right. And then is
Kundalini within us and also the spirit.

703
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:49,078
Now, if a death sould [INAUDABLE]

704
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:52,976
What happens, that the earth element [INAUDABLE]

705
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,874
water element also comes out

706
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:57,031
the rest of the trhee element remain

707
00:46:57,158 --> 00:47:00,455
and the spirit and the Kundalini means top of that.

708
00:47:00,713 --> 00:47:04,002
And that is the death soul. And the living soul with a person

709
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:07,166
which has got the spirit, and thinks that is a soul,

710
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:10,003
I don't know [INAUDABLE]

711
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,823
But [INAUDABLE]  person,

712
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:21,137
who is living, has got a spirit, has
got a Kundalini and has got a ....

713
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:24,354
Yogi: 5 elements
Shri Mataji: also the, all five elements.

714
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:28,588
representing in those centers. But

715
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,315
when he becomes a realized soul,

716
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,496
then he is not as a

717
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:39,684
living soul.
But he's called as an enlightened soul.

718
00:47:43,456 --> 00:47:46,837
Visitor is asking a question.

719
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,714
Yogi: She's peda grow on her own.
She has lot of

720
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:15,988
good experiences, but she' also had a lot of pain.
Is an nessesary experience

721
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,058
that she should have the pain?

722
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:20,542
No, not nessesary at all.

723
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:22,527
Actually you got some good experiences.

724
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:24,402
[INAUDABLE]

725
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:29,201
The good experience should not [INAUDABLE]

726
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:34,006
Now, what is the experience you get first of all.
You get the coole breeze coming out of your head.

727
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:35,537
On the very gross level.

728
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,928
And out of you head and there should
bee cool breeze you should feel arround.

729
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:42,678
Then the second experience we should have is

730
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:45,717
that you should be peaceful with yourself.

731
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:49,633
Absolutely silent, and there is no problem at all.

732
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:53,946
And, if you get any pain. Suposing
after Realization also

733
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,133
you might be some sort of [INAUDABLE]

734
00:48:57,242 --> 00:49:00,860
as soon as put your hand there you can get rid of that pain.

735
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:06,102
So, it is the experience that you have had,
should be an experience [INAUDABLE]

736
00:49:06,555 --> 00:49:09,985
And, if it a person who has given you realization,

737
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:13,086
you [INAUDABLE]

738
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,797
You see, this is a [INAUDABLE]

739
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:20,056
the guru that give you realization,
that makes you an expert.

740
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Visitor talks, bu it's not clear.

741
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:32,002
[INAUDABLE]

742
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:36,158
Yogi: She wasn't just refering to phycical pain,
she was refering to

743
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:39,712
pain in face up to life and so.

744
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:42,009
Be in what?

745
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:45,416
Yogi: pain in facing up to life's problems and wider

746
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:47,548
meaning of her pain.
Shri Mataji: All right.

747
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:51,212
That must stop, that must stop completely.

748
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:54,228
Becouse you start to see the whole thing

749
00:49:54,884 --> 00:50:00,572
as a drama. You are so detached see the
whole thing. You solve the problem.

750
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:02,511
You see the things,

751
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,014
if you become,

752
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:08,577
the spectator of the whole drama,

753
00:50:09,077 --> 00:50:11,842
and you know that you can cure

754
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:15,342
you don't feel the pain. You get [INAUDABLE]

755
00:50:17,178 --> 00:50:20,546
All rigth? May god bless you!
Yogi: Ok, let's have it.

756
00:50:20,874 --> 00:50:25,562
All right. One more [INAUDABLE]

757
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,569
What is it?

758
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:37,501
Visitor is asking: I have two questions, actually.
What is your feeling [INAUDABLE]

759
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:42,524
Yogi: What is the base of cause of disease?

760
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,266
Is inbalance.

761
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:49,576
Tomorrow I'm going to thell you all about. Is inbalances.

762
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:53,091
Yogi: Second.
Shri Mataji: Second one?

763
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:56,193
Visitor...

764
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:58,241
I'm not [INAUDABLE]

765
00:50:58,437 --> 00:51:02,116
If that is Shri Sai Nath. He gives it perfectly all right

766
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:06,798
[INAUDABLE]

767
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:12,321
[INAUDABLE]

768
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:15,222
[INAUDABLE]

769
00:51:15,683 --> 00:51:18,019
Yogi: Can you speek about carma?

770
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:20,815
Ah. The carma a [INAUDABLE]  thing.

771
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,714
but actually, what you do [INAUDABLE]

772
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:28,714
is activated with you ego.

773
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,151
And when the Kundalini rises,

774
00:51:32,549 --> 00:51:33,769
when She

775
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:36,058
passes through this center

776
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:40,159
that is sucked in. That's why it has said, Christ

777
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:42,347
forgive us [INAUDABLE]

778
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:47,206
since he's taking our work, he died for our sin.

779
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,161
In the sense that carma is sucked by Him.

780
00:51:50,552 --> 00:51:51,654
And we

781
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:54,240
are left without an ego,

782
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:57,568
and it is only the ego that has [INAUDABLE]

783
00:51:57,912 --> 00:52:02,583
Once the ego is sucked in there is no carma left.

784
00:52:06,302 --> 00:52:08,302
[INAUDABLE]

785
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,388
All rigth.

786
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,732
Now, let's ask one more question,
all right? They are anxious

787
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,639
to have we the experience.

788
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:20,859
Please ask. One question more.

789
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:24,078
Visitor: You mean we create karma?

790
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:27,219
Yogi: Do you mean that, do we create karma?

791
00:52:27,399 --> 00:52:28,562
Yes, we do!

792
00:52:28,828 --> 00:52:30,789
Where we do action,

793
00:52:30,937 --> 00:52:31,937
you see,

794
00:52:32,086 --> 00:52:36,965
karma is only the myth that human beings have. Animals don't have.

795
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:39,958
They don't have this problem. The problem is

796
00:52:40,114 --> 00:52:43,739
when ego [INAUDABLE]  of you head,

797
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,965
then we develope a personality.

798
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,950
Which is I. I'm Mr. so, I'm Mrs.

799
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:51,872
The I ness we develope.

800
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:56,965
When we develope I'ness,
we think that we are uniques. This is a big [INAUDABLE]

801
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,262
Like a, I give a

802
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:02,684
an expample from the villagers [INAUDABLE]

803
00:53:02,794 --> 00:53:05,301
that you don't have to take to much luggage

804
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:06,911
on an aeroplane.

805
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:09,991
So, they sat in the aeroplane

806
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:12,436
and they put all their luggage on their heads.

807
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:15,131
and the said, "Now we should lessing the weight.

808
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,579
of the aeroplane. It is something like that with our karma.

809
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:23,197
That we take the responsibility of doing the work.

810
00:53:23,393 --> 00:53:26,852
Why we [INAUDABLE]  , you see [INAUDABLE]

811
00:53:26,977 --> 00:53:28,117
Is all there.

812
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:31,797
[INAUDABLE]  said, so we mak them ???. All right.

813
00:53:31,977 --> 00:53:35,258
Death from the death to the death. That's all we do.

814
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:37,266
We make [INAUDABLE]

815
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:39,711
We make this, we make that

816
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:43,461
and then we start using matter for our comfort.

817
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:46,899
And then, matter sits on our head. We can't get rid of it.

818
00:53:47,415 --> 00:53:50,555
Our spirit is supressed becouse of the matter.

819
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:52,570
And then we have to

820
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:55,688
use the matter, otherwise we just can't exsist.

821
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:59,547
So, what we are doing is, we are creating death after death.

822
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,672
But, not the scenery we [INAUDABLE]

823
00:54:02,836 --> 00:54:06,477
We can not transform one flower to a fruit. Can we?

824
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:07,992
We can not do it!

825
00:54:08,303 --> 00:54:13,788
So, what ever is done is done by
God Allmighty, By His living powers.

826
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:20,647
Whatever being is all there [INAUDABLE]

827
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,547
Yogi: Ok. Let's everyone slip their shoes off.

828
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:30,594
So, let's us do make the better contact with the Earth.

829
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:33,610
Shri Mataji: What is ....?
yogi: and put your hands up.

830
00:54:35,696 --> 00:54:38,891
Yogi: So, they recording?

831
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:44,438
Yogi: Be comfortable, sit with your hands on your lap.

832
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:51,420
When Shri Mataji asks, just close the eyes.

833
00:54:54,957 --> 00:55:01,332
Speaking every day....

834
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:05,834
Yogi: All that you do at this stages, be hungry for it!

835
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:08,506
And do ask hungry for it in you heart.

836
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,959
Please Mother, give me my realization!

837
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:16,482
Becouse you have to desire it.
And that's where She can not cross your freedom.

838
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,235
If you don't want it, then as She says you are free to go.

839
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:21,774
But if you wanted

840
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,617
put your hands up and ask humbly in your heart

841
00:55:24,796 --> 00:55:27,414
"Please Mother, give me my realization".

842
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:29,859
We have to humble us all down.

843
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:35,262
Now, we have to put our hands just like this.

844
00:55:36,262 --> 00:55:38,798
Yesterday I told you, day before,

845
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:45,310
that left hand presents, our desire
and the right hand our action.

846
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:51,440
So we have to [INAUDABLE]  put it in you lap,

847
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:54,026
like this. With your finger stretched,

848
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:57,120
and sit comfortable. That's very important to sit comfortable.

849
00:55:57,261 --> 00:55:59,708
[INAUDABLE]

850
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:03,333
Shoes go back, ounder the chair,

851
00:56:03,466 --> 00:56:05,856
and put your feet straight. Like this.

852
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:09,848
On the ground, not teaching each other.

853
00:56:13,082 --> 00:56:15,311
Put the left hand on your lap,

854
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,108
and the right hand

855
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:22,225
[INAUDABLE]  put the both of your hands on your lap.

856
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:24,452
And now, close your eyes.

857
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:28,327
Now, don't open you eyes till I tell you.

858
00:56:28,538 --> 00:56:30,608
Becouse Kundalini want rise

859
00:56:31,045 --> 00:56:34,756
[INAUDABLE]  something has to happen within.

860
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:37,522
So, just keep your eyes

861
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:39,702
completely closed

862
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:41,906
till I tell you.

863
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,694
Now, put your right hand

864
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:51,545
on your heart.

865
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:55,038
on the lefhand side and press it.

866
00:56:56,226 --> 00:56:58,584
Now, you are the Spirit,

867
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,045
and the Spirit resides in your heart.

868
00:57:01,436 --> 00:57:05,048
So, you have to just ask a questions three times.

869
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:08,595
Mother, am I the spirit?

870
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,759
Just ask, in a humble way,

871
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:12,759
and full confidence.

872
00:57:12,907 --> 00:57:16,181
Mother, am I the spirit?

873
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:25,196
Please don't feel guilty. That is one thing
I'm requesting, not to feel guilty at this moment.

874
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:29,376
Forget the past, just forget the past.

875
00:57:52,622 --> 00:57:55,962
Now, keep the right and, left hand as it is

876
00:57:56,126 --> 00:57:57,774
bring the left hand down.

877
00:57:57,884 --> 00:58:00,619
on you stomach, on the lefthand side.

878
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:05,416
to the center which is of the Primordial master.

879
00:58:05,768 --> 00:58:08,299
right hand sorry, left hand towards Me

880
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:12,361
left hand. Sorry I made a mistake, left hand towards Me.

881
00:58:13,986 --> 00:58:17,478
And right hand the stomach and press it hard.

882
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:21,338
Press it hard on your lefthand side of your stomach.

883
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:25,705
Put the right hand on the lefthand side of the stomach.

884
00:58:27,126 --> 00:58:33,266
At this point, you have to say with full confidence

885
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:37,369
Mother, I'm my own guide.

886
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:40,314
Mother, I'm my own guru.

887
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:43,650
Mother, I'm my own master.

888
00:58:44,673 --> 00:58:46,673
With full confidence.

889
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:52,219
Try to sit comfortably.

890
00:59:06,215 --> 00:59:09,713
Now, this has to be said ten times.

891
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:14,306
Because we have ten benances.
Human beings have to ten benances.

892
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,830
So, we have to say ten times.

893
00:59:34,406 --> 00:59:38,456
Now, please put your right hand again to nurish,

894
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:41,073
on your heart.

895
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,916
Here you now assert

896
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:49,994
by saying "Mother, I am the spirit."

897
00:59:52,596 --> 00:59:55,064
Please say, twelve times.

898
00:59:56,689 --> 01:00:01,158
To assert, without feeling guilty. Without feeling guilty.

899
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:04,801
Without feeling guilty, you must assert

900
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:07,660
and

901
01:00:07,926 --> 01:00:12,024
Mother, I am the spirit.

902
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:27,975
Twelve times, please.

903
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Please don't feel guilty.

904
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:41,123
Next thing could be to put your right hand on the

905
01:00:41,248 --> 01:00:45,123
base of your neck, on your shoulder on the lefthand side.

906
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:46,685
Right hand.

907
01:00:47,229 --> 01:00:51,443
From front, on the left hand side.

908
01:00:52,861 --> 01:01:00,249
Here, you hold it tight. From the front you take your hand [INAUDABLE].

909
01:01:01,394 --> 01:01:05,568
And hold it tight. Here we say "Mother,

910
01:01:06,155 --> 01:01:11,861
I'm not guilty, please say sixteen times, please say it.

911
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:18,002
It's too much...

912
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:28,030
Please say it with

913
01:01:28,176 --> 01:01:33,089
all your understanding that, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

914
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:17,263
Now, put your right hand across your forehead.

915
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:22,597
Across your forehead at this one you have to say,

916
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:26,145
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

917
01:02:26,596 --> 01:02:31,739
Please say "Mother, I forgive everyone."

918
01:02:41,737 --> 01:02:46,470
It is very easy to say, just say and it will workout.

919
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:57,979
Now, put your right hand
on the back of your head. Hold it tight.

920
01:02:58,218 --> 01:03:01,384
If the know the optic loop, where it is placed,

921
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,641
on the back of your head.

922
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:10,817
At this point, you have to now say
without feeling guilty, you have to say

923
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:15,347
that is, If I have done any mistakes,
"Oh Lord please forgive me", that's all.

924
01:03:15,378 --> 01:03:19,207
But don't feel guilty.
Please don't feel guilty, don't count them,

925
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:22,935
just say that "Please forgive me."

926
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:26,756
From your heart.

927
01:04:20,129 --> 01:04:23,547
Now, put your hand on the top of your head.

928
01:04:23,662 --> 01:04:27,662
Put it just on top, your hand your palm should touch

929
01:04:27,773 --> 01:04:33,420
the fontanel bone area,
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

930
01:04:33,512 --> 01:04:37,734
And press it, and try to move it clockwise.

931
01:04:37,868 --> 01:04:43,137
Now, at this point as a said,
I cannot cross your freedom and

932
01:04:43,453 --> 01:04:48,836
you have to ask for your realisation, otherwise I cannot force it.

933
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:51,482
Then just say seven times

934
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:56,056
Mother, I want my realisation.
Please give me realisation.

935
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:59,022
Seven time.

936
01:05:08,224 --> 01:05:10,476
Shri Mataji blows...

937
01:05:51,171 --> 01:05:54,659
Now, raise your hand and seek if there is a cool breeze coming in.

938
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,801
Now, change your hand please.

939
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,660
Put your right hand down,
and the left hand on top of your head.

940
01:06:18,732 --> 01:06:21,584
And now see, [INAUDABLE] .

941
01:06:21,658 --> 01:06:24,102

942
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:55,383
You got it, most of you.

943
01:06:56,052 --> 01:06:58,464
All can raise both your hands.

944
01:06:58,796 --> 01:07:04,700
On top of your head,
open your eyes. Please take m higer, higher.

945
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:08,405
And now ask a question, in your heart.

946
01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:11,653
 Is this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

947
01:07:11,871 --> 01:07:13,616
Is this the Brahmachaitanya?

948
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:19,842
Is this the call pervading power of love of God's all living work?

949
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:37,672
Now feel it yourself.

950
01:07:41,629 --> 01:07:46,395
Those who are proper on second time, must have definitely felt it.

951
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:51,599
But I tell you today what is
to done tonight and work it out would be better.

952
01:07:51,969 --> 01:07:55,215
You may get a photograph [INAUDABLE].

953
01:07:55,425 --> 01:07:59,825
In the beginning, is better to use my
photograph because it has got vibrations.

954
01:07:59,935 --> 01:08:06,498
Now what you can do is the put a candle in front of the photograph, and you can see the vibrations are coming from the photograph.

955
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:10,181
Now, put the left hand towards photograph
and the right hand like this, just now you can do it

956
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:12,812
put the left hand towards me at the right hand like this.

957
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:15,555
Now this is the balance. This is the balance [INAUDABLE]

958
01:08:15,648 --> 01:08:19,593
Put left hand towards Me, and right hand out like this at the back.

959
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:22,283
You see like this so we are [INAUDABLE]

960
01:08:22,536 --> 01:08:26,003
All right. Now see on the left hand if it is coming.

961
01:08:33,696 --> 01:08:37,005
You're all thoughtless, if you see that.

962
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:44,124
Now, you put your right hand towards Me and your left hand up.

963
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:48,762
Heart.

964
01:08:50,465 --> 01:08:52,846
You have to believe that you are the spirit.

965
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,391
that's all we believe,

966
01:08:54,488 --> 01:08:58,000
Your believe in yourself. Tthat's all we have to believe in

967
01:08:58,517 --> 01:09:01,072
that you are the spirit.

968
01:09:06,349 --> 01:09:07,714
Good?

969
01:09:09,195 --> 01:09:14,729
All right. Then I teach you how to raise
your Kundalini tonight when you go home.

970
01:09:15,034 --> 01:09:17,859
So this is what you can do on the photograph

971
01:09:17,974 --> 01:09:20,481
and you can see that it starts moving

972
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:25,312
from both your hands. At the most of very much, sort of intention

973
01:09:25,449 --> 01:09:29,024
and If you are very sick, then you can take a

974
01:09:29,525 --> 01:09:34,027
little bowl of water with little salt in it, and put your feet in

975
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:38,489
that bowl and take the vibrations from the photograph.

976
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:43,580
But if you feel cool breeze in your hand and
cool breeze moving in this hand. Then everything is perfect.

977
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,951
Now you have to learn, tomorrow I'll tell you

978
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:50,295
what it means how to use it,
how to become a master. Is a simple thing.

979
01:09:50,507 --> 01:09:54,428
Now today, I teach you how to raise
your own your Kundalini . Which is your own.

980
01:09:54,663 --> 01:09:58,162
Now put your left hand in front of the Kundalini, here.

981
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:01,578
All of you sitting down.
Can you see me? Put your left hand like this.

982
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:06,412
Just like this in front. Like this in front. This hand like this.

983
01:10:07,142 --> 01:10:08,911
The right hand has to be moved

984
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:13,493
up, front, down, back. Like that clockwise.

985
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:17,936
We have to raise. Now, let us raise our Kundalini. Start it moving,

986
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:21,789
slowly, like this, like this, like this.

987
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:28,175
Throw your hands up, absolutely lose and then give it a twist.

988
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:32,284
Throw your head back, and now give it a knot.

989
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:36,859
That's one, we have to do it trice. Again let's do it!

990
01:10:37,137 --> 01:10:41,073
Hold the hand in front and start moving it.

991
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,524
Take it up through your hands and

992
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,369
just give it a twist and here it is.

993
01:10:52,568 --> 01:10:55,695
Third time we have to give give three twist.

994
01:10:56,454 --> 01:10:59,033
You can do it at home.

995
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:04,444
Throw  back your hands

996
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:08,607
head and hands loose, and give it one,

997
01:11:09,484 --> 01:11:11,745
then the second one,

998
01:11:12,551 --> 01:11:17,844
and then the third one like this. Now see if you ???

999
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:33,469
Now, that's one thing more one must learn, how to give

1000
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:36,939
protection to your aura? That is very important!

1001
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:39,299
Protection to your aura, I wish

1002
01:11:39,445 --> 01:11:42,873
people knew how to do it,
they would have saved themselves in many troubles.

1003
01:11:43,052 --> 01:11:46,059
Iis to put your left hand like this.

1004
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:49,126
And with the right hand you move it

1005
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:53,196
Like this, from here. Move it, one

1006
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:58,450
Go back. Two.

1007
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:05,328
Is Three,

1008
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,564
Four

1009
01:12:13,173 --> 01:12:15,323
Five

1010
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:18,680
Six

1011
01:12:21,977 --> 01:12:23,097
Seven

1012
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:31,030
This is how you give protection to yourself. Now, see you vibrations.

1013
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:35,930
All right? Is better.

1014
01:12:36,176 --> 01:12:39,588
Now, what happens that when you are judging other’s vibrations,

1015
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:44,111
you can just start judging like this,
it's all right. Or giving bandage like this.

1016
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:46,767
bandage of love. Because it is felt your hands

1017
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:48,503
when you move your hands actually

1018
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:51,601
the powers is flowing to, through your hands [INAUDABLE].

1019
01:12:51,738 --> 01:12:53,325
So watch your manouvering

1020
01:12:53,472 --> 01:12:57,170
So you give it a bandhan, like you have a [INAUDABLE].

1021
01:12:57,379 --> 01:12:59,601
like that to him, and then sit the vibrations.

1022
01:12:59,763 --> 01:13:02,064
Now, if you want to see your own vibrations

1023
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:06,557
you give yourself a bandhan like
this, and then see your own rubbish.

1024
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:13,845
You try tonight. Don’t talk too much
about it, don't argue. You are beyond mind.

1025
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,120
And that’s why I don’t argue about it.

1026
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,877
The becoming is the most important part

1027
01:13:19,087 --> 01:13:21,626
that it is the difficult part of Sahaja Yoga.

1028
01:13:21,786 --> 01:13:24,023
It is like no other thing that

1029
01:13:24,115 --> 01:13:28,162
here, unless and until become it is of no use. You have to become

1030
01:13:28,486 --> 01:13:34,949
then you have to grow, then you
have to become the expert, ultimately the master.

1031
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,228
That’s what it is. And for whrich you can not pay.

1032
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,275
May God bless you.

1033
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:50,643
Yogi: [INAUDABLE]  Tomorrow night program is here.

1034
01:13:51,377 --> 01:13:52,908

1037
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:07,836

1038
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:14,843
We’ll see you tomorrow night. Good evening.

1039
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:34,959
Those who want to meet Shri Mataji tomorrow evening,
She will spare a few minutes to meet you all. Tonight

1040
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:38,525
She’s just come back from San Diego, and rather tired.

1041
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:40,753
So, tomorrow evening it will be a good chance.

1042
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:45,400
She’ll spend some time with you all here after the program.

1043
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:48,312
Yogini: [INAUDABLE]  Shri Mataji some tea?

1044
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:51,453
Yogi: No, no let's go.

1045
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:53,617
How are you?

1046
01:14:53,882 --> 01:15:00,470
Shri Mataji: Lookin fine.
"I assume so." [INAUDABLE]

1047
01:15:17,192 --> 01:15:23,065
Someone: It's shameful what She said.
Yogi: We will do something. Thank you very much.

1048
01:15:38,332 --> 01:15:41,699
Anybody going to the seminar at the weekend?

1049
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:46,715
Would you be kind enough to just have
a word with Brian Bell, who’s standing here with his hand up.

1050
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:50,737
Because you may be able to help
with transport arrangements for other people.

1051
01:15:50,852 --> 01:15:51,982
It’s a long way

1052
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:57,149
Brian will deal with those people
going to the seminar, who may be able to help with transport.
