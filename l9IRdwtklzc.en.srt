00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,960
Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

2
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:32,135
It is a very important Guru Puja today

3
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:41,616
because we have completed twenty-five
years of Guru Puja.

4
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,871
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating
manner".)

5
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:23,855
Also, it is extremely beautiful

6
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:36,483
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are,
really have become, very great.

7
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:47,277
It’s a question of understanding what
Sahaja Yoga is.

8
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,300
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

9
00:05:52,501 --> 00:06:02,303
that people who were seeking the Truth
have found it

10
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:13,053
and have now got it absolutely on their
central nervous system.

11
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,278
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to
explain

12
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,866
how it has happened, how it has worked out

13
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:26,666
and how, in these twenty-five years, we
have been able

14
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:33,321
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

15
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:45,037
The main thing, I feel, is that you all
should know

16
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:51,820
that as the tree grows, the roots have
to grow much deeper

17
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:57,126
and they should spread also. If it doesn't
happen,

18
00:06:57,327 --> 00:07:03,105
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother
Earth.

19
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:10,947
So the roots are in your own life, in your
own heart.

20
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:18,366
When we say we have become our own Guru,

21
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:24,477
we should really try to find out with our
introspection:

22
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:29,327
Are we our Guru or not?

23
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:36,646
Because, before this your mind was on one
side

24
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:46,692
and your heart was on another side

25
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:52,438
and your attention was in another
dimension.

26
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,198
So these three things were creating
confusion within you.

27
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:14,612
If you understand a human being, then you
will be surprised to see

28
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:23,271
how these three things act separately in a
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

29
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:27,620
First is your intellect and your mind.

30
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:34,612
Second is your heart, your feelings, your
emotions.

31
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:51,021
And the third one is your attention.

32
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,698
In these modern times, this confusion is
the worst

33
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,247
because all the time your attention is
outside.

34
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:10,288
It could be towards beautiful things, or
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

35
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:16,917
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting
your energy.

36
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:23,179
Such attention then is absolutely like
a horse which is let loose.

37
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,442
You cannot control such an attention.

38
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:34,530
And this attention runs wild from one
to another.

39
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:38,597
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very
popular thing

40
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:43,059
to keep the attention moving all the time.

41
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,102
But this attention that has to be towards
the Divine,

42
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:57,612
towards the Almighty, is just being
frittered away.

43
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:04,604
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

44
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,766
First is to find out about yourself: where
does your attention go?

45
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:24,691
What makes you feel like looking after or
concerned for attention?

46
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,695
You see, the attention comes from various
problems,

47
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:40,263
and could be your upbringing where you are
not controlled,

48
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:54,482
could be your education, could be your
atmosphere in which you live

49
00:10:54,683 --> 00:11:00,455
or could be your own ego or your
conditioning.

50
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:07,094
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold,
that's why.

51
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:21,633
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

52
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,652
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

53
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,005
That's fine".)

54
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:50,912
So, this attention is being attacked

55
00:11:51,443 --> 00:12:03,061
by all these outside energies or negative
forces

56
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:10,640
and it gets entangled - like a river
flowing

57
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:20,012
straight into the ocean can get lost
in a barren place.

58
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:29,916
In the same way this attention, which has
to go towards the Divine,

59
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:34,215
gets frittered away and is vanished...

60
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:40,739
This weak attention cannot take you towards
the Divine.

61
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,679
Ultimately you find that all this attention
is being completely

62
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:55,413
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense
that’s going on.

63
00:12:55,614 --> 00:13:01,077
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born
in these modern times,

64
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,429
and in these modern times, as you know,
it's a very chaotic condition.

65
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:11,630
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know
what is right and what is wrong.

66
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:17,208
And there are all kinds of attractions,

67
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:26,324
which can take away your attention and
reduce the energy of your attention.

68
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:34,998
It is possible more for the people who are
very right-sided.

69
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,957
Also the left-sided people can be very much
affected.

70
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:44,765
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to
a point and become extremely dry,

71
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:52,366
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their
attention is in aggression,

72
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:58,654
while the people who are on the left side
are indulging too much

73
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:06,253
into their own whims and their desires and
their own temptations.

74
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:10,602
Both sides can fritter away your attention

75
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:17,570
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

76
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:22,399
But the attention cannot be controlled by
a person

77
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,311
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak
heart.

78
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:35,287
Now supposing you take somebody who is
a very intelligent person.

79
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:39,528
The intelligent person puts all his
attention

80
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:43,835
in capturing the attention of others.

81
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:48,713
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of
a paradox.

82
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:58,862
The person who himself is having such a lot
of aggressiveness and all that,

83
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:03,232
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very
nice with people

84
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:11,967
just to keep good relations or, we can say,
the good behavior

85
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:17,265
towards people so that they pay attention
to that person.

86
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:21,415
This is a very subtle thing. They are not
even aware about it,

87
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:29,553
that we do such a thing just to make others
pay attention to us.

88
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:33,357
That is how we have seen that in these
modern times

89
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:39,246
so many stupid things people do just
to attract the attention of others.

90
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:48,227
Most of the fads that had come up in modern
times

91
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:56,563
are just to make something stupid so that
people should pay attention to them.

92
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:03,748
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like
that. But I am just pointing it out

93
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:07,028
how, in the modern times, you have to be
very careful

94
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:13,740
that you should not try to attract
the attention of others.

95
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:19,123
Instead of that, what you have to do is
to pay attention to others

96
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:23,644
in a very subtle way, not with any
expectation

97
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,791
that if you are paying attention to
somebody,

98
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:31,191
that person should pay attention to you.
It’s a very big struggle,

99
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:39,510
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people
try to, say, become very popular

100
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:47,773
or become very outstanding, or something
of a very great qualities,

101
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:52,501
to show off that they are something better
than others.

102
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:58,178
A person who is really in connection with
the Divine, is least bothered

103
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,364
about how people pay attention to that
person,

104
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:10,140
but automatically the attention of such
a person is on others,

105
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,555
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

106
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:17,788
You cannot make out that the attention
of such a person

107
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:23,987
is on you, but it works and it works
beautifully.

108
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:29,589
We have to understand that we have now come
to the realm of the Divinity.

109
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,686
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are
divine people.

110
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:39,205
We are very powerful people, but if we
fritter away

111
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:43,165
our attention, we become very, very weak
people.

112
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:49,162
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja
Yogis”, “we have done

113
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:55,439
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

114
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,499
All this consciousness if it comes within
you, then know

115
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,829
that you are still not fully developed
Sahaja Yogis.

116
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,926
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

117
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:18,198
There is no need to boast about it. There
is no need to advertise it.

118
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:22,716
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen
by everyone.

119
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:26,664
But even that desire is not needed

120
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:32,879
because you are doing just for
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

121
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,826
So then, when we come to our heart:

122
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:41,562
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you
know very well.

123
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:49,474
Now, when it is the heart, which has
to work over your brain and which can work,

124
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:54,334
what becomes of you is nothing, but you
become a source

125
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,892
of love and compassion. A source, I am
saying.

126
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:03,762
You do not assert on others. You do not say
that, “I’ve done so much for you

127
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:13,126
and what are you doing to me? What is this
that I should have so much expressed,

128
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,114
in so many ways, and here you are,

129
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:20,691
you are forgetting me and not doing
anything for me?”

130
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:26,397
So the expectation of reward if it is
there,

131
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:30,849
then you must know is your mind which is
giving you these ideas

132
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:37,639
and is working it out that way that you
just now put attention

133
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,572
to the amount of love the other person
has given you

134
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:49,173
for whatever you have given to another
person. It's very subtle.

135
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:58,337
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now
yourself as just a source of love,

136
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:02,478
which is just flowing.

137
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,033
In that, you do not say that you have
to have this or that,

138
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:15,624
or you have to achieve this goal, or you
have to become that. It's finished now.

139
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:22,700
Once you have become the source, then how
can you become something?

140
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:28,919
The thing is, those who are receiving from
the source want to have

141
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:40,880
some sort of a reward or some sort of
a recognition.

142
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:47,291
In this subtle way if you move, your mind
is very clever.

143
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:52,418
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever,
intelligent people.

144
00:20:52,619 --> 00:21:00,244
But this mind... You have to be very
careful because this mind can cheat you.

145
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,857
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja
Yoga?

146
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,623
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

147
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:21,227
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then,
you have to ask yourself that,

148
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:29,752
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

149
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:36,556
What do I want to achieve? Why I am
in Sahaja Yoga?"

150
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:41,481
If you ask this question, you will see
you’ll just dissolve,

151
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:46,963
you'll become thoughtless because there is
no desire left now.

152
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:50,851
There is no ambition left, no competition.

153
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:56,299
All these qualities are of the brain, or we
can say, of the intellect,

154
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,909
which makes you competitive, which makes
you also jealous.

155
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,160
So jealousy is also a product of this
competitiveness

156
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:10,939
because when two persons are competing
or many are competing

157
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,147
and one is selected, others become jealous.

158
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:21,150
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All
right. So, one of us has become something,

159
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:23,608
so we should be very happy that he has
become."

160
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,219
On the contrary, the other people feel
jealous, "Why has he become?

161
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,616
Who is he? What does he think of himself?"
Then they go further.

162
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:38,470
Not you people, but on the whole, people
go further with it

163
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:44,044
and what do they do is to harm another
person.

164
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:50,193
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes
very worried and frightened.

165
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:53,255
There is no need to be worried or
frightened

166
00:22:53,456 --> 00:23:00,594
because now you have become a Sahaja
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

167
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:06,844
Anybody who tries to touch you will be
subsided, somehow or other.

168
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:13,125
Of course, I don't do anything as such.
But today only I heard that in Turkey

169
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:19,786
there were two newspapers who were after
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

170
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:26,915
So, the first one met with an accident and
died. I didn't do that.

171
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:32,341
The second one had two people, editor
and sub-editor,

172
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:38,248
were killed and somebody cut their throats.
Of course, I didn't do that.

173
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:41,181
Some fundamentalist must have done, or
somebody must have done.

174
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:46,455
Now, we don't have to worry as to who
criticizes you, they say it about you

175
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:49,430
because you must know they are blind
people.

176
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:55,576
They are absolutely blind, they are not
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

177
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:59,592
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not
possible.

178
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:03,150
They go up to a point and then they stop.
They cannot go further

179
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,390
because this dissolution of your being,

180
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:12,772
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

181
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:18,125
It's difficult, specially in the West,
where there are so many ideas

182
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:26,300
of their own identifications and of their
own personalities.

183
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:34,003
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we
don’t want people

184
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:41,063
to dress up indecently or we don’t want
people to behave indecently.

185
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:45,781
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:24:45,982 --> 00:24:51,223
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say
you have to completely dissolve,

187
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:54,526
then why should we have this dignity?

188
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,144
Why should we worry about having
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

189
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:01,555
This question is all right. The answer is
like this:

190
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:14,309
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

191
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,695
If you put some poison, then the whole
ocean can become poisonous.

192
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:26,663
In the same way, whatever is not congenial
to the ocean,

193
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:31,299
to this Divine power, should not be done.

194
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,835
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it.
We have had experiences.

195
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,956
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders
also,

196
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:47,964
and they tried to be quite funny and
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

197
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:54,339
One person who is not a good person can
spoil the whole collectivity.

198
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,645
The one who is then a leader, on top
of that, is even worse.

199
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:07,816
So, one has to understand that, when you
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

200
00:26:08,017 --> 00:26:13,689
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

201
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,809
In that you should not do something that
will create repulsion, frustration,

202
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:29,423
or even sometimes it can create a very
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

203
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:34,368
That is why we have to be decent people,
decorous people.

204
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:41,721
It is not that in any way we want you to be
like a dandy people or anything,

205
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:47,280
but what it means that you must respect
your body, respect yourself

206
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:51,652
and a respectable personality you should
have.

207
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:54,865
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

208
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:59,379
but it should be such that you should
respect yourself.

209
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,036
It's very important. If you cannot respect
yourself

210
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:09,244
you cannot respect at all the Divinity
within you.

211
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:15,328
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that
your whole behavior,

212
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:20,366
your whole attire has to be in such a way
that people should know

213
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,372
that he is a decent man.

214
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:30,192
Indecent things have come out and have
become now an everyday fashion.

215
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:34,108
And they go on coming one after another
because of the entrepreneurs,

216
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:36,667
and we are playing into the hands
of entrepreneurs.

217
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:39,889
But if you know what dress you have to wear

218
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,762
and what is good for you, once for all you
have to decide.

219
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:47,296
Now the attention should not be also wasted

220
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:50,646
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind
of a sari,

221
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,827
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress,
third day…",

222
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:59,196
because that also spoils the attention.
But if it is a decent thing,

223
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,956
it's perfectly alright, and that will
really make you feel

224
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,661
dignified within yourself.

225
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,644
In modern times, as the people are, I don't
think

226
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:13,264
they have much respect for themselves.

227
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:17,399
You see very highly posted people, highly
placed people

228
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,553
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like
cheating,

229
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:32,310
like having relations with people who are
of dishonorable position.

230
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,595
All this is happening. If you see
in the newspaper, you are shocked

231
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:39,943
how these people at the helm of affairs
could be like this.

232
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:45,034
Because they are still not matured enough
to know where are they,

233
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:48,031
what is their position, how they have
to be.

234
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:52,463
If you are matured enough then you will
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

235
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:57,639
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister,
how I should be.

236
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,647
That all that achievement they have outside
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

237
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:07,667
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed
within.

238
00:29:07,868 --> 00:29:15,466
It has to be absorbed within so that
the attention is not wasted too much.

239
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,747
The another part which one has to see is
the heart.

240
00:29:23,683 --> 00:29:32,083
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our
heart is ruling the head,

241
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:37,358
then we become too much emotional, we get
too much attached to people,

242
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:45,954
we get, you see, sort of individual
friendships and things like that."

243
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:52,176
On this point, one has to know that why do
you get attached to one person?

244
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:58,898
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart.
You get attached to a person

245
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:06,900
because you have some sort of a, we can
say, a relationship, maybe.

246
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:11,148
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that
person.

247
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:15,628
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

248
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:21,144
Something outside quality is attracting you
towards that person.

249
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:25,079
It is not something inner quality that is
attracting.

250
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,806
For example, if you are attached to your
children too much, you will spoil them.

251
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:35,896
They will not come up to your expectations.
Anybody you get attached to,

252
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:42,547
you must verify, why are you attached
to such a person, what is the reason?

253
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:48,160
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached
to each other very much, I know that.

254
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:53,853
But it is not for any external reason.
Because somebody is rich,

255
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:57,470
because somebody is famous, because
somebody is doing

256
00:30:57,654 --> 00:31:02,596
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

257
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:11,392
They are attached to that person because
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

258
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:16,561
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives
you joy and it gives you

259
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:24,331
a kind of an immense dissolution of your
being.

260
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:28,616
So, that happens when you are very much
there,

261
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:34,734
as I have told you the story of once this
potter

262
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:43,740
was kneading the clay and his name was
Gorakumhar,

263
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:47,237
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

264
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:53,512
but very well known poet, both of them
were poets, he went and he saw

265
00:31:53,713 --> 00:32:00,735
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was
not a very respectable work he was doing,

266
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:08,707
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked
at him and what he says that,

267
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:17,739
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya,
to see the formless.

268
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,991
But what I find that the formless has got
into a form."

269
00:32:25,192 --> 00:32:31,470
This only, I always say, is only possible
between the two Saints of the same level.

270
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:36,023
That the way they appreciate, that the way
they feel -

271
00:32:36,224 --> 00:32:40,392
there are no words for what I want to say -
but the way they feel

272
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:46,346
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle
one between each other.

273
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:53,220
Such a feeling if you have for each other,
then know that you are

274
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:58,123
really now dissolved and you are in
the ocean of joy.

275
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:04,026
But on the contrary, those who are sitting
on the shores cannot feel that way.

276
00:33:04,227 --> 00:33:09,068
They judge, they try to find out what’s
wrong with that person, this is not so.

277
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:13,918
They can never appreciate another person.
What they feel is that they have a right

278
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:20,055
to criticize, to find out faults with others
and that they are something special.

279
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:23,349
And the other person also finds some faults
with this person.

280
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,948
So it’s a fault-finding society I find
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

281
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:33,628
But when you see that the another person
who is there,

282
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:42,895
the person who is another saint, you feel
such rapport, such oneness,

283
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:49,382
such a spontaneous feeling for that person
which is absolutely pure.

284
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:55,934
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental
activity to find out

285
00:33:56,135 --> 00:34:03,525
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no
judgment about what he, the person is like,

286
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:13,825
but just oneness with that person you feel,
and you feel that your quality of your love

287
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:19,689
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

288
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:24,426
So it comes to that, what we should
appreciate within ourselves

289
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:31,157
is the purity of our love. When you are
pure, the purity is there,

290
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:39,871
you do not get attached to anything, but
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

291
00:34:40,072 --> 00:34:46,102
In attachment you cannot enjoy because
in that

292
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:54,825
you are bothered more about the superficial
relationship with the other person.

293
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,393
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja
Yoga,

294
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:07,019
you are all very important people -
extremely important -

295
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:14,024
because in the history of spirituality there
were not so many saints sitting together.

296
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:18,317
Never can you see so many people from so
many countries

297
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:24,264
thinking about Divinity and morality.

298
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:30,967
It is impossible to get so many people
together, on any point whatsoever,

299
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:37,615
who are feeling the oneness, the...

300
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:45,591
you can say, the most soothing feeling
with each other.

301
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:52,003
Whether it is comfortable or not,

302
00:35:52,204 --> 00:36:02,660
whether it is very much according to
the norms of comfort,

303
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:11,038
people who are saints are absolutely happy
with other saints

304
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:17,238
and other saintly people. They rush
to people who are saints.

305
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,815
Once it happened to Me when I was
in Kolhapur

306
00:36:21,016 --> 00:36:25,529
that they told Me, “There is a saint who
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

307
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,591
They said, “He lives up there and it will
take at least three hours

308
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:33,591
for You to climb up. He only lives there,
he doesn't come out.”

309
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:36,470
I said, "All right, I would like to go and
see him."

310
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:42,254
So, I was walking and it started raining.

311
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:45,470
So they said, "Mother, You never go
to anybody like that,

312
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:51,997
why are You going to him?" I said, "No,
just I want to go up and see him."

313
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:56,448
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control
over rain,

314
00:36:56,649 --> 00:37:03,940
but it was raining, raining, raining very
heavily, and when I climbed up

315
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:09,598
I saw him sitting down and going on like
this with great anger.

316
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:15,041
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

317
00:37:15,242 --> 00:37:18,890
because this fellow is now not in a normal
mood."

318
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:26,229
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and
there he came. He couldn't walk

319
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:32,579
because his... they say that his legs
became absolutely lame

320
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,363
because of the vibrations that were too
much in him,

321
00:37:37,564 --> 00:37:43,275
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they
brought him there, he sat down.

322
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:49,199
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

323
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,518
It was raining so heavily, and when You
were coming up,

324
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,864
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way
now You are all full of water

325
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:08,394
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

326
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:15,026
So, did You do it just to control my ego,
because I must have developed ego

327
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,937
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

328
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:21,543
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

329
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:26,943
you are My son, isn't it? And you have
bought a sari for Me.

330
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:30,138
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take
a sari from you

331
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:32,385
because sannyasi dharma is different -

332
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:35,523
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from
you.

333
00:38:35,724 --> 00:38:40,051
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you
could give Me a sari."

334
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:45,875
The whole temper, the whole unnatural
behavior, all dropped out.

335
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,447
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes,"
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

336
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:53,428
"At least," I said, "in love you know
everything."

337
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:59,268
And then he brought a sari for Me and he
did Aarti and everything.

338
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:06,749
But, you see, all these things show that
how the love masters everything so easily.

339
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:14,667
Small, small things, if you are expert
in expressing your love,

340
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:20,351
how it works out. There are so many
incidents I can give you like this.

341
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:29,082
But the main thing we have to see within
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

342
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:37,455
Do we really have affection and compassion
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

343
00:39:37,656 --> 00:39:42,706
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also
the blind people.

344
00:39:42,907 --> 00:39:47,154
You should have compassion for them.

345
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:51,787
You should feel that these people are so
unhappy

346
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:55,495
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

347
00:39:55,696 --> 00:40:01,128
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis,
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

348
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:04,773
So, you must have real compassion for them.

349
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:10,757
If you have this compassion you might be
told by people that,

350
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:15,389
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are
doing this, you are doing that?"

351
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:21,338
The compassion is actually, unites all
these things within ourselves.

352
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,171
That’s the uniting factor. First is your
attention,

353
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:31,284
first,  which is very, very important,
I think.

354
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:37,084
And the second one is your intellect, or
you can say your mind,

355
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:44,729
and the third one is your heart. They all
get somehow or other united together

356
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,395
once you have this capacity to have
compassion.

357
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:51,681
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you
don't have to think about it.

358
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:56,897
You just, you just feel absolutely at home
when you are compassionate

359
00:40:57,098 --> 00:41:01,662
and with this compassion, you are having
relations with others.

360
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:08,346
Now, this compassion is not studied out
or worked out or maneuvered.

361
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:14,218
It is just there. It is there. In that
compassion it forgives,

362
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,946
it forgets all nonsensical things.

363
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:23,759
The forgiveness is only possible if you
have this compassion within you.

364
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,166
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked
me,

365
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:30,386
"Mother, how can we have love and
compassion?"

366
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:35,846
I mean, this is a question which many have
asked me.

367
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:42,409
Now, the simple thing is that if you
develop your thoughtless awareness

368
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,586
in your meditation, in thoughtless
awareness,

369
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:50,925
you watch anything in thoughtless
awareness, any relationship you see it

370
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:55,047
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be
amazed

371
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:59,720
how the gates of this compassion will
open out.

372
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:03,593
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

373
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:08,070
but it doesn't go to one person or
to another person,

374
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:13,408
but it is throwing lights on all the sides
of your being.

375
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:22,733
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

376
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:32,210
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

377
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:35,855
and smoothes and soothes everything

378
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:41,920
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and
that is painful.

379
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:44,479
This is what you have now.

380
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,683
You know, these things were done by saints
long time back.

381
00:42:47,884 --> 00:42:51,536
But then nobody liked them, and they
crucified them - out of jealousy.

382
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:56,407
Because if somebody became a saint, then
people felt very jealous of that person.

383
00:42:56,608 --> 00:43:00,465
So they killed them or tortured them and
troubled them.

384
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:05,593
The situation is not so bad now. Of course,
there are some useless people.

385
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:13,900
There are some people who are really
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

386
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:21,113
But on the whole, our attitude should be
that these are blind people.

387
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:26,175
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe,
something wrong with that person,

388
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:30,353
may not be good-natured - may be anything.
But in your heart

389
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:36,367
you should not have any grudge, you should
not have any complaints about them.

390
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:42,334
You can talk to that person about it. You
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

391
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:48,049
but you should not try to make an issue
out of it

392
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,345
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture
anyone.

393
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:57,048
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put
off the fan".)

394
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:08,736
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga,
those people who came and were troublesome

395
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:14,597
and were not of any worth for us, just
dropped out by themselves.

396
00:44:14,798 --> 00:44:17,258
We didn't have to do much about it. They
just dropped out

397
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:24,029
and they have gone into some sort of
a problematic life.

398
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,690
I, even now, receive letters from them
saying that, “We have this problem,

399
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:31,055
we have that problem and how to solve
this and solve that."

400
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:35,028
But it’s automatically happening because,
after all,

401
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:40,941
there is a big choice going on and
the Divine s trying to decide

402
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:46,554
who are capable of receiving the blessings
of the Divine.

403
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:49,188
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

404
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,969
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga.
Nothing else is important.

405
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:58,889
There are people who are very highly
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

406
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,903
There are people who are regarded as very
great, famous people,

407
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:09,583
they go into dust. It's all the time is
happening in your presence.

408
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:14,914
Every day you read a newspaper and you
find how they are behaving.

409
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:19,997
Like today, somebody told Me that in
the newspaper there was there

410
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:27,866
that now one bishop is going to discotheque,
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

411
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:32,252
Now, what people must be thinking, they
must be breaking their heads,

412
00:45:32,453 --> 00:45:36,901
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom
we call as the bishop and everything,

413
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:40,408
is now going to disco."

414
00:45:41,877 --> 00:45:45,475
What they, I mean, all whatever he had
respect,

415
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,593
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost,
finished.

416
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:56,287
Because you see, as they are, they have
no value of themselves.

417
00:45:56,488 --> 00:46:01,288
They just live with their ego, "I am such
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

418
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:04,233
They walk in a different way, they talk
in a different way.

419
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:07,089
And suddenly how they go down.

420
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,369
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

421
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,677
to go to the discotheque, I can’t
understand?

422
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:19,432
So, because of this kind of life that he
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

423
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:24,423
he could never see that, “One day I will
go down like that.”

424
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:27,474
Another thing, which you should see
in a very wider way,

425
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:32,686
that he had no feeling why people respected
him.

426
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:37,815
He never knew why people had respect
for him.

427
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:44,820
Or he was not conscious of it. At least
he would have preserved that. He did not.

428
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:51,464
Why should he go to a place about which
he has been always denouncing

429
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:57,047
and saying that these are bad places, one
should not go there?

430
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:05,591
So, in your case, you have to be conscious
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

431
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:09,611
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that
your consciousness has vanished,

432
00:47:09,812 --> 00:47:15,103
but it has enlarged. You have got
the consciousness of the ocean.

433
00:47:15,304 --> 00:47:21,263
You are not the one who has become like
a mesmerized person

434
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:26,490
or a person who has no connection with
oneself.

435
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:32,049
On the contrary, you are connected with
yourself much more than you were before.

436
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,091
So, when you become the ocean you don't
loose your personality,

437
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:40,191
but you expand your personality. You become
a greater person.

438
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:45,402
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am
noticing many people are developing

439
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:51,567
that kind of a personality, and they are
expressing it and manifesting it.

440
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,561
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

441
00:47:54,762 --> 00:48:00,453
I could see such people who are doing this
kind of thing.

442
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:05,659
So, whenever you are doing something,
whatever is your enterprise,

443
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,675
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is,
that’s all outside.

444
00:48:10,876 --> 00:48:18,179
One should not lose your attention, which
is towards God Almighty.

445
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,699
If that is lost, you are lost. There is
a very nice poem

446
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:30,212
Namadeva has written about that there
was a boy who was flying a kite.

447
00:48:30,413 --> 00:48:34,820
And the kite was floating, and this boy was
looking after the kite.

448
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:40,611
And while he was talking to everybody else,
but his attention was on the kite.

449
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:47,180
Then it goes further. He says that a lady
is having the little child

450
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:53,884
on her body, on the waist, and she is
cleaning the house.

451
00:48:54,085 --> 00:49:00,021
She is cleaning with a little broom. She
has to move

452
00:49:00,222 --> 00:49:03,899
from here to there and after that cleaning,
she has to do other work also.

453
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,404
But the child is here. So, her attention is
on the child

454
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:12,965
that he should not fall down, something
should not happen.

455
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:17,148
Though she is doing all kinds of work,
everything,

456
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:22,472
her attention is on the child. In the same
way, your attention should be

457
00:49:22,673 --> 00:49:26,846
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

458
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:32,413
There’s third one he’s described that there
are many ladies

459
00:49:32,614 --> 00:49:36,664
who are taking water from a river.

460
00:49:36,865 --> 00:49:40,418
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their
heads and walking.

461
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:43,800
And while they are walking, they are
talking to each other,

462
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:46,589
they are telling stories about each other
and anything,

463
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,583
but their attention was on the pitchers,
which are on their head.

464
00:49:51,784 --> 00:49:55,400
In the same way, whatever we are doing,
our attention

465
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:59,329
should be on our Kundalini.

466
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:05,425
We should find out what are we doing.
As it is we have the light.

467
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:11,560
But you must take light into every corner
of your life,

468
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:20,603
every aspect of your thinking, every kind
of an effort you make.

469
00:50:20,804 --> 00:50:25,040
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch
your attention

470
00:50:25,241 --> 00:50:28,370
you will really know what you are doing.

471
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,529
It’s the attention to be watched so much

472
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:40,406
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that
the attention is no more frittering away.

473
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:45,015
Without the attention you cannot work out
Sahaja Yoga.

474
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:51,748
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga,
is that your attention has to be

475
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:57,021
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing
can work out.

476
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:00,555
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you
have come to Sahaja Yoga

477
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:03,572
to make money, all right, you will make
money and get out.

478
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:06,924
If you have come here to show off your
knowledge and all that,

479
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:11,127
you will show it and get out. If you have
come here to show

480
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:17,295
your power and your authority, you stay
there and get out.

481
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:20,110
Like that many people have gone out if you
know.

482
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:26,993
And this is what is to be really taken
care of: that you don’t try

483
00:51:27,194 --> 00:51:31,051
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid
things,

484
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:38,506
which are not permanent, which are not
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

485
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:47,041
for cleansing yourself, for becoming
the ocean, the ocean of love.

486
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:54,465
Now, many people also feel that love is
rather difficult,

487
00:51:54,666 --> 00:52:01,889
because you can be harmed by others, or
somebody can take advantage of you.

488
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:09,600
The main thing about love is, if it is not
a pure love, then it creates problems.

489
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:12,500
Supposing you trust somebody because
of money,

490
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:15,070
trust somebody because of somebody…
relationship

491
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:17,951
or anything, and you go on indulging
into it,

492
00:52:18,152 --> 00:52:24,547
ultimately you’ll find that you will be
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

493
00:52:24,748 --> 00:52:33,151
But supposing you show your love, just
with purity about that person...

494
00:52:33,352 --> 00:52:43,251
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you,
built in. It’s there.

495
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:50,615
We have to just open out. Every human being
is a bundle of love.

496
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,423
And when he is afraid of others - specially
in the West,

497
00:52:54,624 --> 00:52:56,600
there is so many ideas they have created

498
00:52:56,801 --> 00:53:02,022
that you are afraid of this kind of love
and that kind of love and

499
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:05,904
you see the way the perversion and
all nonsense is there.

500
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:13,155
But in pure love there is a kind of
a beautiful light

501
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:20,799
which protects you, which guides you and
which enlightens your life completely.

502
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,427
This light is just nourished and also, we
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

503
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:39,824
this is the one that is for our
spirituality: the Love of a person.

504
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:44,738
You are embodiment of love, take it from
Me, because you are a human being.

505
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:48,825
Even the animals are there who know what
is love is.

506
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:56,134
You see… I know that if you love a tiger,
the tiger will never harm.

507
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:59,010
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

508
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:05,486
If you try to love anybody who is very
cruel and very bad,

509
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:11,646
gradually he will calm down. He will harm
you little bit, he will do this,

510
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:16,507
he will see things and he might be mean
with you, do all kinds of things.

511
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:20,847
But then, gradually you find your love
works, and works, and works.

512
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:26,666
And ultimately it is your love, which is
important to that person.

513
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:32,813
Now, your love is really firstly
appreciated

514
00:54:33,014 --> 00:54:38,674
more by innocent people, like children.
Children know what love is.

515
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:45,968
If the children see you, and they run away,
that means something wrong with you.

516
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:50,650
I’ve seen people… like once we were
in Japan

517
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:55,198
and there were two foreigners who were
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

518
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:58,167
I don't know from which hair-dresser they
had dressed up themselves

519
00:54:58,368 --> 00:55:04,980
and they were very much overly decorated -
and they came with us, you see.

520
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:13,244
We climbed up a place to see something
and when we came down

521
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:18,963
there were some children standing there.
They had gone before us. So they said,

522
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:23,460
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?”
“Which went with you?"

523
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:26,897
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came,
you know, we were frightened,

524
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:31,139
we ran away to our houses. Now we have
come to tell you they are witches."

525
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,935
These small, small little Japanese
children, you know,

526
00:55:34,136 --> 00:55:36,769
"They are witches, you know, they are
witches. Be afraid of them."

527
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,265
And they had decorated themselves so much,
so much hair-dressed up.

528
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:45,224
They have tried to make such a beautiful
show of themselves,

529
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:49,178
but the… for the children, they were
witches and they ran away.

530
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:52,515
And when we came, they came running and
telling us, “Don't be with them,

531
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,257
they're witches.”

532
00:55:55,458 --> 00:56:00,285
So, the judgment of the innocent people
is the best judgment.

533
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:04,748
If they are innocent, they are extremely
well equipped

534
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:08,791
to judge a person - who has love and who
does not have.

535
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:13,476
And they are the best people because they
will appreciate you the best.

536
00:56:13,677 --> 00:56:17,846
They will understand that these are people
of some high quality.

537
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:24,994
But if they are not innocent, cunning,
some people are extremely cunning -

538
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:28,888
that’s the intelligence part of it - they
can never appreciate you.

539
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:36,358
They'll appreciate something which is,
something very, very abnormal,

540
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,718
which from divine part, divine angle,

541
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:52,083
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they
will never appreciate you.

542
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,282
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may,
but may not.

543
00:56:55,483 --> 00:56:59,970
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate
yourself.

544
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:06,245
You have to know that you are not unkind
to anyone, you are not judging others,

545
00:57:06,446 --> 00:57:12,908
and that you are appreciating everything
in that person -

546
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:18,270
whatever is good in him as a human being.
It works.

547
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:22,966
You have seen, this all has worked through
My love and compassion.

548
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:28,272
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you
love or compassion or anything.

549
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:31,352
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you
anything.

550
00:57:31,553 --> 00:57:39,354
I’m not even conscious as to… I have
created such a lot of beautiful people.

551
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:42,581
I am not conscious of that. It’s just
happening.

552
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:46,145
Just like this tree is here, see, it is
not conscious

553
00:57:46,346 --> 00:57:52,168
as to what it is and what it looks like.
It’s just is there.

554
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:57,959
In the same way, if it happens to you,
I tell you, you become really

555
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,441
the source of such a joy for everyone.

556
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:09,361
Now, what do we have to do for this world?
What is needed to be done for this world?

557
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:13,146
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s
no need to do anything.

558
00:58:13,347 --> 00:58:17,921
It just… you become a personality of that
kind -

559
00:58:18,122 --> 00:58:23,918
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy
to others.

560
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,037
Now, this power is within you because it is
built-in, it's within you.

561
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:34,069
It is in a potential form in every person.
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

562
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:47,137
Now, with affection, you may not, but with
love and feeling that is innate within you.

563
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:52,097
Because there are no words for such subtle
things that are within yourself.

564
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:55,401
Because so far people don’t know what are
these things

565
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:59,553
that make you feel oneness with others.

566
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:07,547
All this, all this can happen to you very
easily, very easily,

567
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:14,635
when you understand that you are not this
mind, you are not this body,

568
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:20,565
you are not this attention - you are
the Spirit.

569
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:26,464
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit?
All right, if I am the Spirit,

570
00:59:26,665 --> 00:59:30,122
what is… what am I doing?"

571
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,532
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel,
"Why not others?"

572
00:59:36,733 --> 00:59:41,039
Out of love and compassion. Not for
becoming some leaders or anything.

573
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,464
Just out of love. "If I am that why not
make others like that?"

574
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,532
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread
so much,

575
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:52,827
and we have such gems of people, such
beautiful people

576
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:58,722
that I really never expected so much
to happen in My lifetime.

577
00:59:58,923 --> 01:00:04,096
It has never happened with any saint, any
incarnation, any prophet.

578
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:08,722
So now, you people have become absolutely

579
01:00:08,923 --> 01:00:13,630
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated
yourself fully.

580
01:00:13,831 --> 01:00:17,382
The story of Radha and Krishna is very
beautiful

581
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:24,250
where Radha said that, "Why do You take
this...

582
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:31,910
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word
for Murli’"],

583
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:35,655
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take
this?"

584
01:00:35,856 --> 01:00:39,553
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’,
flute is not so sweet.

585
01:00:39,754 --> 01:00:44,023
"But why do You take this flute to Your
lips?"

586
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:49,182
After all… She, She must have been jealous,
I think so.

587
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:56,185
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

588
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,827
So, flute She went and asked, "Why
Shri Krishna

589
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:03,604
takes you to His lips all the time?"

590
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:07,606
So, he said, she said, "You know,

591
01:01:07,807 --> 01:01:12,900
I have become completely hollow. There’s
nothing in me.

592
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:20,397
He puts me to His lips and people say
that I am playing the tune.

593
01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:26,393
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where
am I? I’m not there.

594
01:01:26,624 --> 01:01:31,705
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is
passing through me.

595
01:01:33,073 --> 01:01:38,271
That is the expression." But then Radha
told Shri Krishna,

596
01:01:38,472 --> 01:01:42,489
"Why don't You make (me) the same way
as the flute?"

597
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:48,060
So, this is what you have to be, the flute,
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

598
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:55,152
All these little, little things, you know,
which come into your life are not important.

599
01:01:55,353 --> 01:02:01,103
What is important is - have you become
completely hollow?

600
01:02:01,324 --> 01:02:05,069
This is where, I would say, introspection
will help.

601
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:10,315
The one who makes the flute is also within
you.

602
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:17,867
So let there be a flute made out of you
by yourself only.

603
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:24,512
This is the way you make yourself what you
have to become.

604
01:02:24,713 --> 01:02:29,483
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva
Atmane Shrushta",

605
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:33,306
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

606
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:37,150
Isn't it very difficult thing to
understand -

607
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,755
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

608
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:43,932
But now you can understand what
Shri Krishna has said

609
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:50,006
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with
itself.

610
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:53,355
Then it doesn't require any other
satisfaction.

611
01:02:53,556 --> 01:02:57,659
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you
seek the joy of your Spirit,

612
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,987
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

613
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:10,877
You don't even seek, but it is in itself
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

614
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:16,360
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

615
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,526
There are many people who say, "I am not
satisfied, you see,

616
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:24,846
this I am not very much satisfied, it is
not that I am satisfied."

617
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:31,242
In the same way, the Spirit can say,
"I am not satisfied."

618
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:37,366
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit
only.

619
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:42,886
It’s like the reflection in the mirror.
When you look at the mirror you see there

620
01:03:43,183 --> 01:03:48,280
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is
not all right, I will say,

621
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:52,206
"I am not satisfied with what reflection
we are getting out of this mirror."

622
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:55,005
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring
the better mirror,

623
01:03:55,206 --> 01:04:00,040
you'll try to get a better picture
of yourself. In the same way,

624
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:06,921
the Spirit which is reflected within you,
wants to see its own image.

625
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:12,594
And then what you do is to… you go on,
somehow or other,

626
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:20,191
changing, cleaning, making it all right
through your meditation

627
01:04:20,422 --> 01:04:25,059
so that your Spirit is satisfied with
the Spirit.

628
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,308
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous
manner because He was very clever.

629
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:31,605
He knew human beings cannot take things
straight,

630
01:04:31,806 --> 01:04:33,786
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

631
01:04:33,987 --> 01:04:38,362
so that they’ll run around and then
ultimately they will come to Truth.

632
01:04:38,563 --> 01:04:43,460
But Truth is very simple. Truth is
extremely simple.

633
01:04:43,661 --> 01:04:47,222
You don't have to go here and there and
you don't have to stand on your legs

634
01:04:47,423 --> 01:04:52,737
or feet all the time. You don't have
to fight with anything.

635
01:04:52,938 --> 01:04:59,671
You don't have to take to some sort of
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

636
01:04:59,872 --> 01:05:08,593
Only just you become like a flute. You
become hollow.

637
01:05:08,794 --> 01:05:12,874
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult
at all for Sahaja Yogis

638
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:17,441
because already the Kundalini has made
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

639
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:24,357
But still, I find people deviate. Their
attention goes here and there.

640
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:27,547
So many people have told Me how their
problems were solved

641
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:31,603
without doing anything about it. I said,
"What did you do?"

642
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:36,818
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus
feet." I said, "Really?"

643
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:41,449
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking
at the problem, what the problem is.

644
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:46,595
We were standing outside and looking
at the problem and the problem got solved."

645
01:05:46,796 --> 01:05:50,401
Even the most difficult problems that you
think, can be solved

646
01:05:50,602 --> 01:05:58,218
very easily because you have powers. Your
powers are great.

647
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:03,350
You are saints, but more than saints,

648
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:09,913
much more than saints because you are born
at such a volatile times.

649
01:06:10,114 --> 01:06:15,879
Like supposing, you have a light in
darkness, you are finding something,

650
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,843
you bump into that and you bump into that.

651
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:25,891
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

652
01:06:26,272 --> 01:06:33,727
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

653
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:42,499
But you must get out of this nonsense
of "me", "my" and "mine".

654
01:06:43,623 --> 01:06:47,679
I don't know how to say you get out -
It’s not like a swimming pool,

655
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,413
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not
like that.

656
01:06:51,614 --> 01:07:00,046
It is another kind of a very subtle
understanding that our roots have to grow.

657
01:07:00,247 --> 01:07:03,804
And for growing our roots, we have to go
within ourselves

658
01:07:04,005 --> 01:07:12,249
and find out within ourselves what is
the area we are occupying,

659
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:20,087
in what areas in our lifestyle we are
taking these roots inside.

660
01:07:20,288 --> 01:07:26,690
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree
of life has the roots in the brain

661
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:30,426
and grows downward. It’s very interesting
to understand

662
01:07:30,627 --> 01:07:34,109
that the roots are growing in the brain.

663
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:42,437
That means, your own intellect is just
covered with compassion,

664
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:53,895
it’s just being absolutely one with
compassion.

665
01:07:54,506 --> 01:07:57,033
I had told you a story about a saint

666
01:07:57,234 --> 01:08:01,721
who was to take to… water for the Deity
n Gujarat

667
01:08:01,922 --> 01:08:08,978
and he walked one month to go there with
a pitcher of water.

668
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:17,066
And then at the… because it was a very
high mountain on which this Deity was,

669
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:22,786
and he reached at the foothill.

670
01:08:22,987 --> 01:08:28,125
There he found a little donkey dying
of thirst

671
01:08:28,326 --> 01:08:32,805
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

672
01:08:33,006 --> 01:08:35,575
So those who were with him, they asked,
"What are you doing?

673
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:39,492
You brought it all the way, and why are
you putting it for this donkey?"

674
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:40,661
He said, "You don't know?

675
01:08:40,862 --> 01:08:44,771
The God has come all the way down, just
to meet me here.

676
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:47,067
He doesn't want me to climb up."

677
01:08:47,268 --> 01:08:55,504
This kind of an absolutely simple
understanding

678
01:08:55,705 --> 01:09:03,471
of another's feelings and another's
problems:

679
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:07,938
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

680
01:09:08,139 --> 01:09:11,060
And the person will tell you that, "You
sorted out my problem."

681
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:17,129
But you will not know how you have solved
because this love is the power.

682
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,011
This love can see things. It is everything.

683
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:25,057
It’s like a… you see a television,
all right, it’s a television.

684
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:27,681
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

685
01:09:27,882 --> 01:09:36,369
If you see anything you do with the power,
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

686
01:09:36,570 --> 01:09:41,159
You need not have to telephone. I never
telephone to anyone.

687
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,830
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

688
01:09:45,031 --> 01:09:48,177
I never telephone. But not to save
the bill,

689
01:09:48,378 --> 01:09:52,738
but I do not telephone because there is
no need.

690
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:57,051
The whole subtle of the ether is at your
feet.

691
01:09:57,252 --> 01:10:03,702
Just you want to do something you can just
do it, just with the vibrations.

692
01:10:03,903 --> 01:10:08,920
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

693
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:14,832
You all can cure, you are so many. You can
cure anyone you want to,

694
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:18,348
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not
needed.

695
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:21,268
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

696
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:27,677
You can solve all their problems yourself.
One little Bandhan can solve it.

697
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:31,445
But for that you should be the source
of love.

698
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:40,274
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful
love takes over,

699
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:43,918
"All right, I'll do the job."

700
01:10:45,151 --> 01:10:49,712
But for that you have to be the master
of this beautiful thing.

701
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:54,770
Now, one thing is very different from other
masteries.

702
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:58,526
In other masteries, you see people try
to dominate

703
01:10:58,727 --> 01:11:03,946
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

704
01:11:04,147 --> 01:11:12,961
But the mastery of love is that you know
how to build

705
01:11:13,931 --> 01:11:22,492
a rapport with the Divine love. And this
Divine love is not only powerful,

706
01:11:22,693 --> 01:11:33,956
but it is such a efficient, I should say,
such an alert instrument

707
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:37,253
which works out everything in such a manner

708
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:42,217
that you are amazed how things have worked
out.

709
01:11:42,418 --> 01:11:46,072
And everybody has noticed it. I know you
all know it.

710
01:11:46,273 --> 01:11:48,770
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

711
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:53,530
You have to be on the vibratory awareness
and use that.

712
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:57,645
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself
clarifies you.

713
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:04,981
Imagine in your hand there is this great
power of giving you this balance,

714
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:09,387
this love, this affection and all
the protection

715
01:12:09,588 --> 01:12:14,077
while you can give it to others also. You
have become now

716
01:12:14,278 --> 01:12:19,417
the part and parcel of the Divine power.
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

717
01:12:19,618 --> 01:12:24,295
And whatever you want to do can be done
by this divine power.

718
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:29,530
With all this telling you I still feel,
sometimes, you are not confident.

719
01:12:29,731 --> 01:12:35,987
You get upset. You feel that, "How can
this be?"

720
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:39,848
You have no trust in yourself, you have no
faith in yourself.

721
01:12:40,049 --> 01:12:47,215
And also there are some people, sort of,
who feel they are neglected,

722
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:51,278
or something should have happened to them.

723
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:56,641
Once a lady started crying. So, I said,
"Why is she crying?"

724
01:12:56,842 --> 01:13:01,846
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

725
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:07,471
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know
why she thinks like that.

726
01:13:07,672 --> 01:13:13,960
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

727
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:17,248
You are all right? Why should I smile
at you?"

728
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:20,250
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

729
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:23,598
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja
Yoga,

730
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:28,775
Mother should all the time be only attached
to you.

731
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:33,532
She cannot get attached, you know.
It’s a helpless condition I have.

732
01:13:33,733 --> 01:13:38,345
There are so many, you don't know, defects
I have, which you have no idea.

733
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:40,421
I don't know how to count money.

734
01:13:40,622 --> 01:13:43,791
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it
two hundred rupees.

735
01:13:43,992 --> 01:13:46,337
You see, I don't know many things. I don't
know banking;

736
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:50,159
I don't know many things and one of them
is I don't know

737
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:56,307
how to put attention to this person or
to that person. Like politicians would do -

738
01:13:56,508 --> 01:14:01,152
"You see, ah, you must look after this man,
because he is very important." Nothing.

739
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:06,933
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me,
finished, nothing more than that.

740
01:14:07,134 --> 01:14:12,975
So, you see, everybody so should know that
you are very close to My heart,

741
01:14:13,176 --> 01:14:17,837
you are very much there, I am very proud
of you. And something,

742
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:23,811
really it’s a miracle that has happened,
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

743
01:14:24,012 --> 01:14:28,910
So on that point also, that how much Mother
cares for me, what She does...

744
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:31,708
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right,
you don't sit here, sit there,"

745
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:35,390
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel
bad.

746
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:41,278
This kind of a person has no sense of love.
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

747
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:44,258
So, at the end of the whole thing I must
tell you,

748
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:49,042
that when you are a guru, you are also
a mother.

749
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:55,213
You have to express yourself like a mother.
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

750
01:14:55,414 --> 01:14:59,856
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary,
but in her own sweet way she corrects

751
01:15:00,057 --> 01:15:04,605
so the correction takes place - it's not
that a rebellion starts.

752
01:15:04,806 --> 01:15:11,386
So all that wisdom of a mother is within
you, is already there, so please try to use.

753
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:17,615
I am sure, it will all work out and as it
is we are a very beautiful group of people

754
01:15:17,816 --> 01:15:28,946
who are something out of the blue, who are
so much in peace and in joy together.

755
01:15:29,147 --> 01:15:32,414
May God bless you all.

756
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:44,906
So, today's Guru Puja will be...

757
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:50,112
Of course, we can - we can have a little
of Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha,

758
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:53,551
but Devi Puja will be much less.

759
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:59,754
And for Guru Puja I would request
the country leaders to come up.

760
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:04,665
Country leaders have to come up. So it is
in a different way,

761
01:16:04,866 --> 01:16:08,761
we can say that the main thing is
the Guru Puja

762
01:16:08,962 --> 01:16:11,421
where the country leaders have to come up.

763
01:16:11,622 --> 01:16:17,691
The Devi Puja will be followed after that,
which is very short.

764
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:22,649
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
