1
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:16,300
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:30,120
These days there are people who are going
all over the places to find out the Truth,

3
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:43,260
the enlightenment. And there are so many books
available, so many people who talk about enlightenment.

4
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:54,139
And this is only in this special age, which
I call as " the blossom time ", is happening.

5
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:02,399
If they are not seeking the Truth, that means
they are not yet evolved as this should have

6
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:13,750
been. But this is a special time that we call
as the "Last Judgement" and that time has

7
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:23,209
come. In the Koran it's called as Kiyama and
described very clearly what will happen at

8
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:37,680
this time. All these have been indicated in
all the books which are, I would say, mystical

9
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:46,370
or we can call as religious - whatever you
may call it - the mystic part of it. They've

10
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:57,790
all indicated this time, this time by the
end of this century, this should happen. And

11
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:10,990
this has bewildered many people, they are
going hither and thither, getting into problems.

12
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:29,760
As it's very embarrassing what Dr. Derek Lee
has told Me. Is a fact that I went to Russia

13
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,500
and a scientist came forward and he said that:
" Mother, I have seen your photographs and

14
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:45,980
it says so much because I haven't seen more
than one line showing. " It is very embarassing,

15
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:53,740
the whole thing was very embarrassing for
Me. And he said: " I've proved it now, through

16
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:00,069
all equations and everything. " And he showed
Me the book which is in Russian language and

17
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:09,050
all mathematical calculations, that one has
to go to a vacuum state, a physical vacuum

18
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:19,839
state, for Reality to be understood. It was,
I think, too much of science in it.

19
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:30,180
For whatever it is, all these ideas, say of
Koran, of Bible, of other religious books,

20
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,970
all the religious books from India could be
called as a myth and they were treated as

21
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,449
myths. Many people thought it was just a myth
and they said there's no use believing in

22
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:50,540
all these things, there is nothing. And also
through these books, people have been misled

23
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,060
to do wrong things, so the whole thing got
challenged also in a way: that it's not practical,

24
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,140
it's not beneficial, is no good.

25
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:10,230
But when it becomes a real experience - you
may call it subjective, may call it anything

26
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:22,240
- but when it becomes a real experience, then
you start believing in it as Reality. But

27
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:31,740
if a scientist proves it with his scientific
knowledge, then I don't know what to say,

28
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:44,350
then it really becomes the fact. And when
it becomes the fact it becomes the science.

29
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:52,199
Science can be challenged. First of all, science
is amoral. It is not bothered, as a science

30
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:59,679
as it exists today, if they create atom-bombs,
they create other things destructive and use

31
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,110
it for wrong purposes, there is no binding
force on the scientist. They can do whatever

32
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:17,179
they like and people can use it the way they
want to use it. But when it comes to Divine

33
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:26,540
force, the science is perfect, I must tell
you. You cannot challenge that science, you

34
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:39,720
cannot - everything that you know through
the science of Sahaja Yoga, you can easily

35
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,079
verify it.

36
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:53,160
For example, firstly it is said that your
physical elements disappear, it's a fact.

37
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:05,939
Without any money, without any fees or anything,
just you get cured of your troubles. And when

38
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:13,559
you get cured of your troubles, then you are
amazed how through your own power you have

39
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:21,520
been cured. But it happens, it has happened
- you know, we have many doctors here - English

40
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:31,760
doctors, not easy to convince - and they have
seen with their own experience that many patients

41
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:43,209
who were supposed to be incurable are cured.
They have seen that many drug addicts got

42
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:53,240
all right overnight. How? Without paying for
it, without taking any medicine, just through

43
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,740
their own power of Kundalini.

44
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:05,910
Now this power of Kundalini was known all
over the world, I think, because I find in

45
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:15,160
their museums Kundalini drawn in the triangular
bone even in Sweden I saw. But I should say,

46
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:24,920
it's in Finland, I saw. Then also, I went
to Ukraine in their museum, there are all

47
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:35,720
pictures of these chakras and of the Kundalini.
And in a farfetched place like Bolivia, where

48
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:45,260
it could not reach there even by air about,
I think, six years back, you find the pictures

49
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:57,179
of Kundalini. And Colombia, the ancient Colombia
had created statues in which Kundalini was

50
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:05,220
the main thing. So somebody must have told
them or they might have known about Her. But

51
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,740
somebody went from Italy to Bolivia and the
Bolivian people said " We know all about it,

52
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,909
yes, we know. But we don't know how to raise
the Kundalini. " And now there are I think

53
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:23,010
eight, nine thousand people in that farfetched
place of Bolivia who have got their Realization.

54
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,090
For which you don't have to pay. Is the main
thing one should understand. It's like you

55
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:36,440
don't pay for your breathing, you don't pay
for your digestion - in the same way for your

56
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:46,510
ascent to a new life, last, we can say, the
breakthrough of your evolution, for which

57
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:56,500
you don't have to pay. As soon as you understand
this point, you'll be amazed that you'll give

58
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:04,169
up all nonsensical people who are marketing
their things, selling their things. You see,

59
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:14,970
it's something absurd, the absurdity to such
a limit that you become blind and you don't

60
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,340
know what they are doing, what they're up
to. And don't want to listen to anybody who

61
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,580
wants to tell you the truth.

62
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:36,220
Now if we have to see for our own ascent - as
they say in Koran, Miraj - in India this thing

63
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:47,399
is called as Self-realization, Atma Darshan,
or you can call it, Atma Sakshatkar. If you

64
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:56,350
really want it - it's very easy and has to
be easy, because it is so vital. And when

65
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:04,100
that works out, you actually experience it
and it can be tallied with the description

66
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:14,090
of it. The trouble is we are so mental. We
want to derive everything on a mental level.

67
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:19,510
But thank God, this scientist has found out
something for your mind to go round and round

68
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,020
and round and reach the point. Because I think
sometimes this mind, which is filled with

69
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:34,780
all kinds of false ideas - sometimes slightly
right ideas or sometimes real ideas - they

70
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,570
go on bombarding in your head. And this scientist
has said that you have to go to the vacuum,

71
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:51,790
which Jung has described as thoughtless awareness,
to become thoughtless. When you become thoughtless,

72
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,530
then you can see, feel Reality.

73
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:06,060
So, what happens, how do we get thought? When
we go to some place, we see something - immediately

74
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:13,290
we react, that's our habit. This can be also
proved scientifically why we always react.

75
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:23,090
Either we react towards it or we absorb it.
So, all the time our mind is working - and

76
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:30,360
it is a wobbly mind. You are all the time
bothered with it and the modern times are

77
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,700
the worst, though this is a special time,
as I said, because this is the time when people

78
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,540
think the most and this thinking goes on acting
in such a way that they suffer from all kinds

79
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:50,340
of diseases. Also sometimes this mind doesn't
tell you that this is wrong, that is wrong.

80
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:57,200
You go on doing things you know, for example,
Hitler, how he behaved, how he killed so many

81
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,840
people, but he never realized he was doing
something wrong, never. Ultimately, he killed

82
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,200
himself because he was afraid that he'll be
caught, but not that he repented. So, they

83
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,919
go on doing wrong things all the time without
knowing that they are doing wrong things.

84
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:22,050
Now, to say this is sin, that is sin only
fills people with fear, that's all and guilt.

85
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:29,809
But actually when you become the Self, in
the light of the Self, you know what is right

86
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:39,000
and what is wrong, what should be avoided,
what is not beneficial for you. You just know,

87
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,270
because you know about your Self, you get
the Self knowledge that is you can feel your

88
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:52,640
centres - has been told to you - on your finger
tips, this again is said in the Koran that

89
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,120
" at the time of Kiyama - the Last Judgement
- your hands will speak ". But whole thing

90
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,809
gets perverted sometimes by using it for a
wrong purpose, that's how we have destroyed

91
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:15,679
sometimes the real knowledge, the subtle knowledge
of our being. It's nothing to stand for hours

92
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,090
together on one leg in Himalayas torturing
your body. You don't have to torture your

93
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:29,490
body at all. People think that if you have
to perfect yourself, you must torture. This

94
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:37,300
body is the temple. What is the use of building
temples after temples when you cannot build

95
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:44,780
your own temple? This body is the temple and
why should you torture this body? You must

96
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:53,320
look after this body, look after with love,
with respect and then only you will realize

97
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:03,300
how important is to have a body. All these
funny ideas, you know, of renunciation and

98
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,960
all false kind of approach is not going to
help.

99
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,919
My daughter was coming from India. She said,
there were some fair people travelling with

100
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:24,119
us in first class. So, they wouldn't allow
the air hostess to come and serve them, because

101
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:31,320
they cannot allow the air hostess to talk
to them. So I said " Did you talk to them?

102
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,619
" Said "How could I, I'm a woman, who would
talk to me?" Because she's a woman, nobody

103
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:42,700
would talk. Then, sat on the ground. There's
no ground but they wouldn't sit on the chair

104
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:50,369
and eat the food. For what? Because they are
renouncing everything, I think they have renounced

105
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:56,350
their brains, that's what it is.

106
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:04,809
All kinds of stupid things people do, for
what? To achieve that state of tranquility,

107
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:12,360
the state of Self realization, of Self knowledge.
But just think of it, which is what has to

108
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:21,389
happen inside. What's the use of doing something
outside unnecessarily making a mess of yourself

109
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:33,300
and of others? It is absurd, the way people
try to understand that by troubling your body,

110
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:41,260
by making a mess of your body, making a mess
of the whole society that you can achieve

111
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:48,470
something which is so subtle and beautiful.

112
00:24:48,470 --> 00:25:00,550
Now, the scientists call this All Pervading
Power, or which I say, of Divine love, as

113
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:09,860
cosmic energy, or they may call it by any
name. But it's nothing solid, it is Love,

114
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:21,240
it is love of God. And this Divine love of
God is an energy that runs the whole universe,

115
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:33,040
universes of universes. Just see the miracle
of life. All that is managed by this energy

116
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:42,730
of Divine love! Well, we have never felt it
before, so we don't know what it is, but in

117
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,710
every scripture it's written there - that
there is the power of Divine love. For example,

118
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:58,179
in Sanskrit, this is called Parama Chaitanya
or Brahma Chaitanya. In every scripture it

119
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:04,190
is being described, but for people it's some
sort of a... unknown thing.

120
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:14,800
But now, with science, if it can be proved
that the whole universe is managed by this

121
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:25,440
energy which thinks, which understands, which
loves. For example, the same scientist came

122
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,030
to see Me, to have an interview with Me. He
was smiling all the time and he asked Me very

123
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:39,629
interesting questions. One of them he asked
about the picture he had seen. Where? Here

124
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:47,040
in this hall. They were singing the song " Sitting
in the heart of the Universe " and all over

125
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,530
Me came: heart, heart, heart, heart, just
like a doctor would draw the line of the heart

126
00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:03,429
- so many hearts drawn with the rays of light.
And he asked " What is this, Mother? How do

127
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:10,360
they know that they are singing this song?
" I said " Because I know, so they also know.

128
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:19,639
" Precisely how do they do things? Because
they know, they know more than anyone can

129
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:28,570
know. Not only that but the way our genes
and all those things are there is a very subtle

130
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:37,429
thing, no doubt, but is all managed by this
power of Divine love. Please understand: there

131
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:48,869
is nothing to fear, nothing to get upset,
nothing to starve, nothing to climb Himalayas,

132
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:58,190
nothing needed. This power loves you and it
is around you, here it is. It is everywhere

133
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:04,520
and it pulsates, it vibrates, it creates everything.

134
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,700
Also the scientist told Me about Einstein,
who said that " All these ideas come to me

135
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:16,950
not from within but from without as if somebody
is pouring these ideas into me. " And he said

136
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:25,369
" I felt the same way and so many scientists
feel that. " Surprisingly, in Russia the scientists

137
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:32,399
are very open hearted. And at the time of
Stalin, they were all arrested and put in

138
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,480
a place called Novosibirsk (?), where they
were living, and there they developed, you

139
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,589
see, this subtler side - because they were
not allowed very much to do other things.

140
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:49,700
So they developed the subtler side of human
beings, and there they found out also about

141
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,909
auras - he is one of them - auras: that human
beings have auras and from the auras, you

142
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:04,359
can diagnose their diseases. But now, after
seeing My photographs and all that he has

143
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,089
reached the proper conclusion surprisingly.
And I think, I hope I'll be saved from all

144
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:17,359
kinds of people who criticize Sahaja Yoga
as a cult or this and that. It is not. It's

145
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,050
a living process whether you are a hindu,
muslim, christian, anything, is meant for

146
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:34,379
you and it is your right, your birth right
to have it. And then after that, once you

147
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:41,540
get the sprouting of the seed, you must allow
this tree to grow. Actually, those people

148
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:48,560
who talk of social work, talk of helping others,
doing this for them and doing that for them

149
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:56,510
have to understand: first you should be empowered,
you must have the power within yourself to

150
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:02,000
help others. But if you just come to My program,
they always say " Mother, for Your program

151
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,399
the whole hall is full. " and then they start
disappearing - specially in England, very

152
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,329
surprising. England is the heart of the universe,
and how could they be so careless about their

153
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:24,260
ascent and so careless about developing their
own huge big tree of love. They are the best

154
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:33,899
suited and they have to work it out. But they
don't, they don't take it seriously. Why,

155
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:45,300
I don't understand. Maybe they don't know
what they are. They are very powerful people,

156
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:54,940
they are, I should say, the instrument of
the Divine. Only thing, they have to develop.

157
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:03,849
But they stick on to this or stick on to that
- then you can't grow. This is a seed already

158
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:12,020
placed within you - undisturbed, unspoiled.
Only thing is a little water of love has to

159
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:22,310
be poured on it, then the seed sprouts, and
when the seed sprouts, it rises, the plumule

160
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:30,909
sprouts out into and it rises, goes up and
comes out of your fontanel bone area, which

161
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:42,210
is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language,
meaning the hole to feel the Brahma, the All-pervading

162
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,179
power.

163
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:50,820
I've seen people who know also Sanskrit very
well. They are running here organizations,

164
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,480
but they don't know anything about Kundalini,
it's very surprising. What do they read, I

165
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,099
don't know. And if you go to them, they'll
argue so much with you that you feel like

166
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:08,889
running away from them. Only they know how
to argue. No argument needed actually, it

167
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:15,470
is there, within you, this power is. Do you
argue with your stomach how to digest the

168
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:22,849
food? And even if you do, will the stomach
understand? It's as stupid as that, to argue

169
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:29,960
about something which is so spontaneous, which
is a living process - it's a living process

170
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,500
of your evolution. Now, by the way, how did
we become human beings? Do we know? And how

171
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:45,139
do we become a super human being? If there
is a way, there's a method, you don't have

172
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:52,480
to spend anything. But you have to grow. If
you don't grow, it's useless, as Christ has

173
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:04,030
described, just as some seeds fell onto the
land which was not fertile. Is it so? Are

174
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:11,149
we living in a land which is not fertile for
spirituality or we are running after some

175
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:20,040
things which are illusive? Why should we run
after illusive things? Here, you get the experience,

176
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:30,060
all right, after that you must grow. If you
grow, you can change this world - it's a global

177
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:37,030
movement. Like in Russia, I would say, there
are millions, millions in Russia. While in

178
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:48,270
India, too, we have may be millions. And also
Austria - so many countries have got it - Italy,

179
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:57,200
imagine. Their people have awakened, so why
not in England? And the leaders of England

180
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:06,409
are rather upset with the English. They think
this... " It doesn't work out, Mother. " I

181
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:13,490
can't understand. Because this is the seventh
time I'm here, and seventh heavens you have

182
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:22,450
to know, that you can know without any difficulties,
without paying anything, the whole knowledge

183
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:32,280
is free! Is it because it is free you don't
care? They've asked Me to talk about it. Otherwise

184
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:40,919
it's not worth talking about these things.
Your country as such is like really the heart

185
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:49,260
and it circulates all over the world. All
your newspapers - they may be useless - but

186
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:56,109
they circulate. All your media - whatever
they may publish - it circulates all over

187
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:01,760
the world. You don't know about Americans,
though it's supposed to be a very great country.

188
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,000
We don't know about any other country so much
as we know about England. How? Why? Monarchy

189
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,609
in so many places, but we know everything
about monarchy from England. Why? How? How

190
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:25,290
do we manage? Is worth asking this question:
there's something special about this country.

191
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:32,980
I lived here for years, I've worked hard,
I went from North to South, East to West.

192
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:40,849
Perhaps, I left no city which I did not visit.
But the situation is such that when they get

193
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:45,170
Realization, they are very happy, they start
jumping, and after that they forget about

194
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:58,260
it. It's a great responsibility on people
of UK that they can do so much in spirituality.

195
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:11,079
Not...it's not something also so cheap that
it can be sold, it's invaluable. It's invaluable.

196
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:18,700
It's your right to get it. And also it's your
sensibility that you should grow into it.

197
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:27,849
For example, in England, when I first came,
I had to deal with the drug addicts, they

198
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:36,130
were the first who came. Perhaps, they were
seeking in drugs the Truth. When they came,

199
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:42,930
overnight they gave up their drugs - overnight
- even alcohol - people gave up overnight,

200
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:50,640
overnight. Believe Me, they are here now,
I know they are sitting here.

201
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:59,310
Now, this is the minimum, and so many people
got cured. I really wanted that something

202
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:05,910
should be written about the miracles of Sahaja
Yoga. So I told one gentleman, Englishman

203
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,190
he is, he wrote to Me " Mother, it's not even
one month, from both the sides, all the letters

204
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,500
have gone up over my head. I don't know how
to select. So, can you give me some time?

205
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:24,540
Myself, I have no time at all. You can select
yourself. " With all this, why don't you experiment

206
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:32,250
and why don't you grow? You are very important,
this is what you don't understand: that you

207
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,700
have been born in this country or you have
come to this country - whatever it is - it

208
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:50,099
is a very important, significant place and
a life of yours. But you should understand

209
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:59,609
that it's very important and that you should
grow. But it is beyond Me to understand that

210
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:10,220
in a place like Austria, in a place like Italy,
how is it, they have understood it and they're

211
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:17,950
automatically working it out? I, you know,
I have crossed My 75 years of age and I don't

212
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:28,780
know how long I will have to live to face
the English people and how will they understand!

213
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,490
Sometimes, it's beyond Me.

214
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:40,710
But now you will know that it is a science
and the scientists have said that they have

215
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:49,220
seen the cosmic energy emitted out of My head.
That's a fact that Sahaja Yogis know. Sahaja

216
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:56,519
Yogis know, they have felt it, they have got
this experience. For them, it's nothing new

217
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:02,420
- not through science - but they have known
it as an experience.

218
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:12,089
Now for you... You are also very well-educated
people, everywhere, you are respected very

219
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:21,599
much, it is for you now to evaluate your own
personality and understand: Why are you on

220
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:32,960
this earth? What is the purpose? So many of
you got Realization last time, but you are

221
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,390
nowhere, you've done nothing... I mean, you've
got your Realization, all right. Each person

222
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:52,520
can give Realization to thousands of people
if he gets out of his own, I should say, own

223
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:04,490
ideas. And this can do such a lot of good
to the whole world. Formerly, in America it

224
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:11,829
was terrible, because all kinds of funny people
went there, to make money. So, they told Me

225
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:18,040
" If you don't ask for money, Mother, in America
nobody will come. They have to pay for it,

226
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,980
otherwise they don't value it. " I said " But,
sorry, you cannot, how much, you tell Me how

227
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:30,150
much should I charge. How much do you charge
for your mother's love? Then you tell Me how

228
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:38,750
much you charge and then we can work it out.
" And it was surprising that it hit their

229
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:47,240
heads. Now it's better. Same thing, I have
to request that, please, find out, when you

230
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,220
have this experience of Kundalini awakening
that you are a chosen person for a special

231
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,710
work.

232
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:06,660
For example now, this instrument, if it is
not connected to the mains, what is the identification,

233
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:14,140
what is the purpose? That's why then people
become hippies, they become this, then punks

234
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:20,880
- because they have no identification. But
the identification is only one: that you are

235
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:29,589
the Spirit, that's the Truth. And it has to
happen to you, that you are the Spirit, you

236
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:37,660
have the power of the Spirit. In the light
of the Spirit you start seeing, start seeing

237
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:46,650
and understanding so well about all the problems
that are in the whole world and your own problems

238
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:56,680
also. It's not only Self knowledge but also
global knowledge of a very subtle nature.

239
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:04,540
And that is all is within you, all this horizon
is there waiting for you to greet it. But

240
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:16,109
I don't know why people have no confidence
or no understanding. Anything can be done,

241
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:23,450
but first of all you must have the pure desire
to become that. Forget about everything else.

242
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:32,910
For example, this power of, which resides
in the triangular bone. This bone is called

243
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:41,780
as Sacrum, means the Greeks also knew that
this is a sacred bone. This power is of pure

244
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:52,359
desire. And if you have the pure desire you
can become so dynamically aware of yourself

245
00:42:52,359 --> 00:43:01,780
and aware of everything. I was surprised that
in a far-fetched place like Russia we have

246
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:09,470
to always take a stadium, you can't do it
in this hall, you cannot manage, I think.

247
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:16,329
How is it, in that country it is working?
Because of communism, perhaps. They were so

248
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:26,460
oppressed, that all the search started going
inside. But just in such a short time, I was

249
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,720
surprised, these people, how did they get
it and how did they develop and they are still

250
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,069
developing, all of them are developing. And
only I am the person allowed in Russia now

251
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:53,720
to go and preach - this is also another thing.
This ignorance that we have, the problems

252
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:04,859
we have - physical problems, mental problems
- it will all be controlled.

253
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:13,799
Now there's a new disease, as you know, Alzheimer.
How it comes? If a person is extremely aggressive

254
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:23,170
and torturing people, doing this. When he
gets old, his brain deviates and only that

255
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:31,670
bad stuff start working and that person who
is suffering is not aware of it. And you cannot

256
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:43,859
cure it, also. But in the lifetime, if you
get your Realization and you become absolutely

257
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:53,859
peaceful within yourself, such diseases cannot
touch you, they cannot disturb you and you

258
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:03,910
become a loving beautiful person. You don't
bother about what he earns, what the other

259
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:10,299
person has got a personality, this, that,
nothing. It's just a subtle love you feel

260
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:18,359
for everyone. For everyone, whatever religion
he may belong, whatever country he may belong,

261
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:26,900
whatever problems he may have. Can you believe
in a place, in a country like Turkey Sahaja

262
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,509
Yoga sparked like this. There are two thousand
Turkish people who are meditating and their

263
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:39,099
Prime Minister's wife came to see Me, just
to get her Realisation. Now, what is so great

264
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:46,410
about? They say Ataturk was their leader and
it is the one who has led the path. Why?

265
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:52,400
You had such great people: William Blake and
so many... Shakespeare, this, that - they

266
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,559
were all realized souls. Their poetry is not
just to read, but to read between the lines

267
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,799
what they are saying.

268
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:11,329
It is very important now, I request you, at
the end of this century, that once you get

269
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:19,249
your Realization here, please, grow, become
more collective. Certain funny-funny ideas

270
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:25,339
I heard and I was surprised - that the hall
is not all right, and that... - there's nothing

271
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:35,460
to do. It's something that happens inside
you, something that works inside and gives

272
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:41,460
you that beautiful feeling of being the Self.

273
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:50,249
As a result, your health improves, you become
mentally a very satisfied and a very balanced

274
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:57,549
person, all your stress, this and that disappears.

275
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:07,660
Thirdly, you look much younger than what you
are, because inside you are younger.

276
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:15,079
Fourthly, you understand others, you love
others, love to do things for others and all

277
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,589
these stupid problems of fighting with these,
taking revenge on the person, killing somebody

278
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:30,349
- this all disappears. That with the name
of God all these stupid ideas, which has created

279
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:39,509
the global problem, will disappear. The time
has come and it is the Last Judgement. I think,

280
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:50,880
the levels are changing: those who are chosen,
I should say, this path of Divine love are

281
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,279
going higher and others, who are negative,
are going downward, they are getting exposed,

282
00:47:56,279 --> 00:48:04,380
everywhere, they are getting exposed. They'll
be exposed. That is for you to decide which

283
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:09,970
way you want to move, what you want to have.

284
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,910
I think, this is the first time I am saying
this to you, I've never said this way. I told

285
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:22,930
you what you are - you are so great, this,
that and this, that - but despite that, if

286
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:38,940
you don't realize your value is wasted. So
when you become the Spirit, then everything

287
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:49,079
changes for you. I am surprised how people
start understanding the follies of their brothers

288
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:55,789
and sisters, who are forming a big society,
things like that.

289
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:05,249
For example, they give up drinking. When they
give up drinking in France, Sahaja Yogis were

290
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:12,059
thought to be mad - because how can you do
without drinking? And now the French are taking

291
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:18,700
to Sahaja Yoga very much. Imagine, French
are much more than they are here. And they

292
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:25,509
are saving money because they are not wasting
on anything: no drugs, no smoking, no drinking.

293
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:32,480
But we don't say " Don't do it! ", because
otherwise half of you will go away, but it

294
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:39,349
just happens to you. For example, if there
is light, you can see everything clearly:

295
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:46,309
whatever is destructive, you just don't do
it. But whatever is constructive we accept

296
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:52,480
and work it out. Such love and such affection.
For example, these people who were singing,

297
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,749
they're from all over the world, they are
not only British. Especially the British,

298
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:03,920
very difficult to learn Indian language, it's
impossible. And look at them how they are

299
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,559
singing. And not only that, but singing Indian
classical music, which is a very difficult

300
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:20,549
thing. I didn't teach them. It's very surprising,
how things work out. So many artists I know,

301
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:30,489
who have earned the world fame with Sahaja
Yoga. But we have an Academy and so many foreign

302
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:37,779
boys went there and studied Indian music.
I was amazed: in three months they were singing

303
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:45,470
Malkaus raga with all elaborations. Impossible!
How can they do all that? Also there's one

304
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:53,400
boy I know - he was hardly fourteen years
of age when he came to Me - and within one

305
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:02,539
year's time he is a great violonist, he plays
Mozart without seeing any papers, anything.

306
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:11,289
How can do it? He was not like that. And he
writes such beautiful poetry. You can't believe

307
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:17,109
it! I asked him " When did you start? " - " After
seeing You, Mother, I don't know why I'm writing.

308
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:28,050
" I have seen people, who are scientists have
become poets. Can't understand, how your sleeping

309
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:36,579
- or I would say - dormant qualities just
come out. You don't run after success, you

310
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:43,670
don't run after competition, but automatically
it happens. For that you don't have to worry

311
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:52,180
" I am old, how can it happen? " - nothing.
At any age it can happen to you. At any time

312
00:51:52,180 --> 00:52:03,999
it can happen to you. So don't doubt about
yourself also. Then you become a very loving

313
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:14,079
sweet person, very sensible and dignified.
You don't insult others, don't trouble others,

314
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,749
but you help, you share the difficulties of
others. Suddenly you find, you've become a

315
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:30,019
part and parcel of a great collective which
is working in the whole world. It is very

316
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:38,829
surprising, how you have brothers and sisters
all over the world and wherever you go, they'll

317
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:46,930
give their life for you. Have you seen such
a family anywhere? Beautiful people!

318
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:53,759
So, I have to make a request to you. Today,
of course, I'll try to give you Self-Realisation,

319
00:52:53,759 --> 00:53:01,630
if possible, it works out. But you must respect,
you must respect and you must grow. All the

320
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,819
saints have talked about it in India.

321
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:18,420
Now, we have here lots of people from, say,
Punjab, the Sikhs are there. And all these

322
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:27,999
books have been described for Sahaj. He himself,
Guru Nanaka said " Sahaja samadhi laago ". He

323
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:35,249
has used this word, all of them have used
this word. But Indians who are here, I don't

324
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:41,509
know, they are... they say " We cannot digest
Sahaja Yoga. " They can only digest pounds,

325
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:56,470
I think. Very surprising. It's very surprising
how this materialism has come over. But does

326
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:04,819
it give happiness to anyone? Does it give
joy, does it give friendship? Full of jealousy,

327
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:13,279
competition - all nonsense is going on. You
overcome all that just like this, you enjoy,

328
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:19,489
everything. If somebody has a good furniture,
all right, this is a very nice carpet, all

329
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:27,950
right, so what you do, you look at it, you
enjoy. You enjoy whatever is created beautiful.

330
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:34,309
You don't think about it, you don't react.
The reaction is that there's joy. What a beauty

331
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:40,319
it is! You don't think who has made it, how
much it will cost, nothing. You become thoughtless.

332
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:52,049
And thoughtless awareness is nothing but such
a pouring sense of joy. Joy which is neither

333
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:59,849
happiness or unhappiness, but singular. You
cannot describe it in words but you can really

334
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:07,640
feel it inside yourself, that joy of being
the Self. And that's the time has come for

335
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,099
you to get it. You are also here for that
and this is the special time when it is going

336
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:23,569
to work out. Now you feel also a collective
consciousness, that you can feel on your fingertips

337
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:30,359
the chakras, the centres of other people and
who is the other? On your centres you can

338
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:35,180
feel your problems, in the same way you can
see the problems of others. If you can cure

339
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:41,109
your own centres, you can easily cure the
centres of others. Without any money, without

340
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:49,470
any fuss, without anything. It's very, very
simple, it is all built-in within you. All

341
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:58,480
this is built-in within you and this built-in
power starts working. You don't have to do

342
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,720
anything. It's all there, for example you
see so many lights are here: you switch on

343
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:12,730
and you get all the lights. But you know how
to switch on: it's all built-in. Again I say,

344
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,319
you don't have to stand on your heads, you
don't have to break your necks, nothing. As

345
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:30,680
you are you are wonderful. And this is your
own individual mother: She is your own, She

346
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:39,200
has no other child, and She knows everything
about you. As you have in the tape, you see:

347
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,160
She knows your past, She knows your aspirations,
She knows you very well and She is the one

348
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,700
who is going to give your second birth. She
is your mother. She loves you. Now there are

349
00:56:53,700 --> 00:57:01,869
books saying that if you have the Kundalini,
She disturbs you, it is the modern ones. Well,

350
00:57:01,869 --> 00:57:07,200
they say that "burns you". She is your mother.
Have you heard, I mean maybe in these modern

351
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,759
times everything is possible, but can a mother
burn her own child? She has been waiting for

352
00:57:13,759 --> 00:57:23,089
ages to give you this Realization. For ages
She is within you and now you don't give Her

353
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:33,539
a chance to give you a second birth? How can
that be?

354
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:41,849
You will understand that all these great incarnations
who came on this earth have helped to build

355
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:50,249
up this. They are all there within you, on
these centres, which you'll find out. And

356
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:56,849
all these fights going on stupidly in the
name of God or anything is nonsense because

357
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:06,349
they are all one. We are only fighting. So
all your global problems, all your fighting

358
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:16,130
problems, all your family problems and the
word "problems" disappears. It happens. It

359
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:27,539
must happen, because you are specially blessed,
and you are the Spirit. This collectiveness

360
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:34,329
gives you the feeling of oneness with others.
Not out of jealousy, not out of greed, not

361
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:43,390
out of any carnal love or anything, but it
is just pure love, pure love which you have

362
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:50,670
not experienced. All the perversions drop
out... But you don't become sort of an abnormal

363
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:59,259
person on the street, you see, walking with
your closed eyes, no. You become an enlightened

364
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:06,710
person, absolutely normal. You dress up normally
outside, you can live with your life. But

365
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,970
then you understand what is your dignity,
your decency and everything. There's no show

366
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:21,739
outside of your achievement but you know within
yourself. You also know who is a Realised

367
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:32,839
soul and then you meet. There's such a connection.
Has been always, but now it becomes obvious,

368
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:42,109
evident and you can work it out. The most
important thing is that your brain opens out

369
00:59:42,109 --> 00:59:52,339
like this, like a lotus. It opens out. All
the problems of brain drop out. How many diseases

370
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:59,299
there are of brain, I wanted to know, so there's
such a big book. I said, "My Goodness, more

371
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:06,910
than the petals we have in the brain". And
it can happen to anybody in the modern times.

372
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:15,369
It's very common, it's awaiting at your door,
sort. All this can be solved, absolutely you

373
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:23,660
can be saved, you can be protected. And every
time you will be feeling this: you are protected,

374
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,829
there is somebody to protect you, to encourage
you, to look after. Who is that? That is this

375
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:37,309
Param Chaitanya. That is this, they call it
Ruh, they call it the All-pervading Power

376
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:43,160
of Divine Love, they also call it the Cool
Breeze of the Holy Ghost, as you feel a cool

377
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:50,130
breeze on your fingertips. It's all written
there in all the books, but symbolically,

378
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:55,650
so people don't understand.

379
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:11,799
Once it happens, then you are in another world.
Such miracles, such help and such protection!

380
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:20,029
It's a thing where you feel, you can never
be drowned in the ocean of this mad world,

381
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:28,299
because now you are in the Ocean of joy. You
are enjoying and this is what you have to

382
01:01:28,299 --> 01:01:36,059
have. But you must grow, all of you must grow.
I am staying on for one day more just to come

383
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:40,970
to follow-up meeting. Also if you have any
complaints you better bring them. But there

384
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:45,359
is nothing to complain actually, you should
complain against yourself. Either you are

385
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:52,569
lazy, or you are too enthusiastic or you are
infatuated by some sort of a nonsensical guru

386
01:01:52,569 --> 01:01:57,349
or something is there. Just don't try to criticize
others but see for yourself, introspect: why

387
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:11,089
is it, why can't I do it? All this can work
out, I assure you. I assure you very much

388
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:17,190
that you should realize that My coming to
England, living here for years together. I

389
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:23,390
didn't come for Sahaja Yoga. I came because
My husband got a job here. And then, seeing

390
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:41,789
people in England, I thought, they can really
achieve a lot.

391
01:02:41,789 --> 01:03:00,319
May God bless you all!

392
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:06,170
Derek is asking Me, "Better give them Realization."
I know, they are ready to get it, but they

393
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:12,210
have to grow, that's the point, I'm telling
you. He feels quite helpless and he doesn't

394
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:23,089
know what is the matter with them. I told
him " You grow some beard, moustaches. " Maybe

395
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:34,400
a better idea. Might be they're used to things
like that. It's nothing external. It is the

396
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:42,519
internal beauty that we have to know.

397
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:52,930
Now, it's very simple. If it doesn't shock
you, I'll tell you there are two, three conditions.

398
01:03:52,930 --> 01:04:05,499
The first one is you have to take out your
shoes, if it doesn't shock. Because this Mother

399
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:22,670
Earth helps us a lot - She absorbs all our
problems.

400
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:41,450
All right. Now, the second condition is - which
is also not very absurd - that please don't

401
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:50,520
feel guilty about anything. It's a fashion:
"I'm very guilty." - "Why are you guilty?"

402
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:56,749
- "No, I've to confess - I am very guilty."
- "About what?" - "You know, the other day

403
01:04:56,749 --> 01:05:04,710
I was eating the food and I was holding knife
on the right hand." - finished. These norms

404
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:11,989
are human beings have created this kind of
stupid things for which you should feel guilty.

405
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:17,619
And that this center here, on the left hand
side, you get spondylitis, also angina, it's

406
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:26,269
a fact - so, not to feel guilty! What are
you guilty about? If you were guilty, you

407
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:32,630
would have been in jail, not here. So, please,
first of all, forgive yourself completely.

408
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:43,309
You are not guilty, I assure you. There's
a new evolution with people's mind that they

409
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:50,170
should feel guilty - finished. If you are
guilty, when it happens, you should have done

410
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:58,979
something about it, forget it. Why are you
carrying that load on your left Vishuddhi,

411
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:02,039
here? This is the second one.

412
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:10,229
And the third one is - I think, is also very
simple - is to forgive yourself, as I said,

413
01:06:10,229 --> 01:06:16,379
and forgive others. Now, you say " Mother,
we can't, just we can't, it's very difficult.

414
01:06:16,379 --> 01:06:21,349
" But try to understand the logic: whether
you forgive or don't forgive, what do you

415
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:31,489
do? Nothing, just the same. But say, if you
don't forgive, then what happens: you play

416
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:38,849
into wrong hands, you torture yourself. So,
just say in your heart " Mother, I forgive

417
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:45,950
myself fully, I forgive others fully " - whether
they are in your mind or not, just say that

418
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:50,549
and your this center will open now in no time.

419
01:06:50,549 --> 01:07:00,859
This will all help Me a lot. These tree things
are very important and I know you can get

420
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:07,630
your Realization in no time.

421
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:15,519
So to put your hands like this towards Me,
like this, just simple, as if you are asking

422
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:25,319
for your Self realization, like this. Need
not be higher, just whatever is comfortable.

423
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:29,390
People can't believe that sitting in the hall,
how can we get Realization? But you deserve

424
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:40,650
it. You get it because that's the time, and
because you are seekers.

425
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:50,489
Don't doubt yourself, please. Have your hands
like that. Now, you can close your eyes, if

426
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:54,930
you want to. If you don't want to close, don't
close your eyes. Because there is no mesmerism

427
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,529
going on: at least, I close My eyes.

428
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:15,400
Now, put the right hand towards Me, and put
the left hand on top of your fontanel bone

429
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:27,850
area. Now, you'll feel some cool or hot breeze,
coming out of your fontanel bone area, which

430
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:40,460
was a soft bone in your childhood. Don't put
your hand on top of it, you have to put it

431
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:47,920
away from you, and you can move the hand to
see yourself. Don't say that you've got it

432
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,170
unless and until you've got it. You are not
to cheat ourselves, all right. Now, please,

433
01:08:53,170 --> 01:09:02,219
put your left hand towards Me and put the
right hand on top of your head. You can bend

434
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:13,690
your head, that's better if you bend your
head, and with the right hand you see.

435
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:22,940
Once more, please, put your right hand towards
Me, and again with the left hand you see for

436
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:30,700
yourself, if there's a cool or a hot breeze
is coming. Now, don't doubt it: if it is coming,

437
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:39,150
it is there. Could be hot, it will cool down.
Can move up on the sides and see for yourself.

438
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:47,910
Now, open your eyes and put your both the
hands towards Me like this. Now, watch Me

439
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:57,800
without thinking, without thinking, just try,
you can do it.

440
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,410
Ah?

441
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:11,340
Now, raise your both the hands towards the
sky like this, push back your head. And ask

442
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:16,700
anyone of these three questions three times,
anyone of them:

443
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:22,510
First one " Mother, is this the Cool Breeze
of the Holy Ghost? " - first question is " Is

444
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:34,780
this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost? " Second
question is " Mother, is this the All-pervading

445
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:49,780
Power of Divine love? " Third question is
" Mother, is this the Ruh, or the Param Chaitanya?

446
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:59,530
" Ask anyone of these questions three times
in your heart.

447
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:15,580
Now, again put down your hands, that's all.
Now, put your hands like this towards Me,

448
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,690
just like this.

449
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:23,950
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
on their palms or on their fingertips or out

450
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:36,540
of their fontanel bone area, please raise
your both the hands.

451
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:44,500
Just look at that! You're proving what I've
said. Just look at that! Now, you've got it,

452
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,440
now this is a responsibility to grow.

453
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:56,239
May God bless you! May God bless you!

454
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:23,090
Such a joy, such a happiness! I wish you best
of luck and also wish you a very, very deep

455
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:28,250
understanding of your being.
