2
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:39,800
I'd belong to a family of very

3
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,800
enlightened people my father was a

4
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:48,239
linguist and he was mastered of 14

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:53,010
languages he knew about 26 languages and

6
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:59,489
he translated even karana sharif into

7
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:05,489
Hindi language my mother was in those

8
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:09,180
days was honours in mathematics so both

9
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:19,920
were very well educated and enlightened

10
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:24,600
people at the time of my birth my mother

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,509
dreamt something which she could not

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,380
explain but after that she had a great

13
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,240
desire to go and see a tiger in the open

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,459
field my father was a great hunter

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,979
because Tigers were the meanest in the

16
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,520
area where we were living it was a hill

17
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,929
station called Xinhua

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,470
so there was a king who was very much

19
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:52,649
interested in my father somehow other a

20
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,259
letter came that there's a tiger very

21
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,880
big tiger that has appeared and they're

22
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,789
frightened of him that he might be a

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,899
maneater

24
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:07,800
so my father took my mother and me to

25
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,840
that place and they were sitting what we

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,950
call as a mechon where they bid

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:19,459
something for people to sit on top of a

28
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:22,380
tree from where they can shoot nicely

29
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:26,310
and then my mother tells me that a big

30
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:30,060
huge tiger of a very big size very

31
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,959
beautifully appeared on the field and

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:40,129
she felt tremendous love for the tiger

33
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,129
it was a full moon day and she felt

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,900
extremely compassionate towards the

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,510
tiger and when my father raised his gun

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,170
to shoot she stopped and she wouldn't

37
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:56,130
allow when the Tiger went away and he

38
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,250
never came to that forest again but that

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,040
made my father think because he himself

40
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:07,530
was a realized soul that must be

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:12,150
somebody what we call a goddess durga

42
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:15,989
who is fond of the tiger must be bought

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,630
on to my mother because the symptoms

44
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,930
were rather funny that lady should like

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,000
to see a tiger ever so he told my mother

46
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,410
now are you satisfied because they were

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,019
struggling with the gun he said he's

48
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,769
there and Durga sitting in your womb

49
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,959
that you are trying to protect the tiger

50
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,050
she said yes yes so stop it now I won't

51
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,720
allow me like that there were many

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,650
incidents in my life because I am off a

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,810
Christian family brought distance and

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,910
when I was born my mother didn't feel

55
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,450
any labor pains or anything and just I

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,549
was born she didn't know how and I had

57
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,010
no blood on my body nothing I was clean

58
00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:00,180
washed that's why they called me I knew

59
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,280
as their mana but my grandmother said

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,549
that she should be called as Nishka

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,730
lanka that means the one which has no

62
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,840
spots on it but that's the name of math

63
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:14,760
so they said all right we'll call her

64
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,650
Nirmala meaning the same immaculate now

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,190
all these incidents and then my father

66
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,610
being a realized soul he felt tremendous

67
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:29,280
vibrations from me and he felt that this

68
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:33,090
life is great and she do something

69
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,039
reaching this life I do not know why but

70
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,520
I don't know if he dreamt or he

71
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,470
understood it but all the time if I

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,190
remember when he talked to me he used to

73
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,000
say that you have to find out a way of

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:50,370
giving a masse realization all the time

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,650
as I told he was a great scholar of so

76
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,790
many things and very

77
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,520
widely that man so he gave me a good

78
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,720
education in religion

79
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,460
in different religions and also good

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,280
education about human beings what are

81
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:10,919
their problems why did he act like this

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,410
why don't they take to God why are the

83
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,080
hypocritical all kinds of things he

84
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,740
talked to me he also knew about

85
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:24,090
Kundalini but not so much of course when

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,150
I was born I knew about Kundalini myself

87
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,190
I knew all about it from my very

88
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,220
childhood it was very aware person

89
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,110
extremely aware I didn't know how to

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,150
talk to because see people didn't have

91
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,300
that awareness you can't talk to

92
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,280
everyone like that so I was regarded as

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,840
a very jolly person at the same time

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:49,320
very serious also very deep and then I

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:06:01,670
started my studies as a child

96
00:05:49,320 --> 00:06:05,000
[Music]

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:08,270
I was not very much interested in the

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,700
study's bias to do very well but I used

99
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,450
to read lives of great men and things

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,560
like that at a very young age I were not

101
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,550
shocked when people were reading justly

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,220
expectations I was reading but not

103
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,800
shocked but as such I didn't have

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,210
interest in particularly reading some

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,130
textbooks because I thought they were

106
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,030
childish and when there's nothing to

107
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,890
read about it then I told my father that

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,830
I have to do medicine so he said why I

109
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,210
said because I have to talk to doctors

110
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,840
he said you have to talk to doctor us

111
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,490
yes I said but it so happen in my

112
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,660
childhood when I was about 7 years of

113
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,040
age my father was a congressman he had

114
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,160
joined Congress when I was four years

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,140
old he is totally with the style with

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,480
the westernized his clothes west East

117
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,610
England and sort of a man we had

118
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,810
governesses in order you threw away

119
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:08,720
everything maybe real Indian and started

120
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:12,950
leading a life of Amartya then he made a

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,740
study our language is Sanskrit he made

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,540
me study in an Indian school not in a

123
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,060
missionary school because missionaries

124
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,680
were very unkind they threw us out of

125
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,820
the school when my father was in the

126
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,700
Congress they were against us completely

127
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:32,510
then at the age of seven years I

128
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:36,440
happened to go with my father to heart

129
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:38,060
ma Gandhi he was about 72 mice living

130
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,490
with us but the first time he took me

131
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,490
down and madman and he liked me very

132
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,260
much he said leave this child with me so

133
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,900
I had not been taken clothes or anything

134
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:52,850
I stayed on when my father sent me

135
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,310
everything with him and it was very fond

136
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,600
of me but I was a little girl but she

137
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,860
understood that there was something

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,680
about me he consulted me on very serious

139
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:07,370
problems sometimes surprisingly like one

140
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,710
day he wanted to make the prayer book

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:12,800
all right so he asked me how should I

142
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,020
put the series and all that so I told me

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,419
how to

144
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,500
series and he put the series in that way

145
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:23,470
I used to go back for my spoon and again

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,039
go back to manager every year like that

147
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,819
and he called me Nepali give me a name

148
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,800
Nepali

149
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:35,110
everybody used to call me Nepali that

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,570
time then I grew up with him very

151
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,399
intimately it was a very very kind

152
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,860
person for children otherwise an

153
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,870
extremely strict man with himself and

154
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,709
with others very strict a big

155
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,540
disciplinarian and he would make

156
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,360
everybody get up at 4 o clock have your

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,279

158
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,140
morning prayers at 5 o clock you see and

159
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,329
used to walk very fast I also learnt

160
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,079
walking fast with him in his company had

161
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:04,839
to walk fast and with extremely loving

162
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,850
and a very nice person and he would

163
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,260
listen to me because I was a child

164
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,329
you see supposing I forced him to eat

165
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,680
more or something than he would in love

166
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:16,329
he would accept very kindly person but

167
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,890
with others was very strict and I used

168
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:21,490
to tell him that why you restrict with

169
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,290
him to burn he said but you are a little

170
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,700
girl you get up in the morning time why

171
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,709
can't I get up I said I am literally

172
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,240
that's why I get up that big so they

173
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,589
can't get up like that I see little

174
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,540
chats and then my father went to jail

175
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,690
and my mother also went to jail five

176
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,310
times my father went to jail twice once

177
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,410
for about two and a half years and he

178
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,680
was the only supporting member of the

179
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,860
family by the way we come from a very

180
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,620
old royal family which is called a

181
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:55,390
shalivahanas they have a calendar also

182
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:59,350
in India and then when we I mean when

183
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:01,570
they took my father to jail we had to

184
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,690
leave our house and to live in hearts

185
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,270
and in all problems that was nothing but

186
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,730
also me they've tested a lot because I

187
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,560
helped many people there and I joined

188
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,510
the 42 movement in a very serious way

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,950
and I became the leader here for the

190
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,459
young people I thought unless and until

191
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,420
I take a very positive stand it may not

192
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,420
work out with them

193
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,240
it's not vicious to say how are they

194
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:29,040
tortured me what they did to me but they

195
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,610
really tortured me I was a young girl of

196
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,839
nineteen years that time it's over now

197
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:39,240
so it's finished and after that we my

198
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,570
father went to really again and then

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,660
when he came back he got elected as the

200
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,510
member of the central Assembly later on

201
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,470
as the Constituent Assembly and then at

202
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,690
the Parliament

203
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:55,380
my brother was also a member of the

204
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:59,519
Parliament later on now recently he was

205
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:03,140
the minister in the cabinet another

206
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,730
brother is a High Court judge in Bombay

207
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,910
they are all being well despite the fact

208
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,649
that our parents and neglected us in a

209
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,560
way because they gave their lives of the

210
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:16,399
country but you see that never debtor as

211
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,980
from studies and we came up very well

212
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,410
then I when I was in 42 whom went to see

213
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,810
my college desta gated me from the

214
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,050
college they threw me out and I had to

215
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,370
go to another college to study far away

216
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,199
from my house

217
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:38,779
he went out but I studied for two years

218
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:42,360
science I did then I did my medical I

219
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:45,209
didn't do fully because just after that

220
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,920
the 47 riots broke out so College was

221
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,870
closed and I didn't want to know more

222
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,990
because what I wanted to know I came to

223
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,260
know about it so I did not need and I

224
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,420
got married you must have heard my

225
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,769
husband was is now the secretary-general

226
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,350
of the International Maritime

227
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:05,550
Organization he held a very high

228
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,440
positions he was also secretary to Al

229
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,449
Bahadur Shastri who was our prime

230
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,610
minister who was another very great man

231
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:13,709
but he did not survive long if you had

232
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,390
survived things would have been

233
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:18,060
different I think for our country

234
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,089
because he was a Gandhian out-and-out

235
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,560
panthéon and he lived like it ideal

236
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:36,580
mantheon personality

237
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:42,080
[Music]

238
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:46,339
so that's how life went on but inner

239
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:49,270
being was still seeking the way and

240
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:52,940
methods of giving amass realization

241
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:56,540
my father said before you do not develop

242
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,790
this technique of giving a mass

243
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,440
sterilization don't talk of religion let

244
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,010
nobody know that you know anything about

245
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,339
it

246
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,140
because they'll crucify you or he was

247
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,700
rather worried that people won't

248
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,580
understand or you may write another

249
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,370
Bible or Gita no use first of all you

250
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,839
must give them realization if they get

251
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,710
their realization then they will realize

252
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,440
that there's something about about this

253
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,870
human awareness for example he always

254
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,120
used to give an analogy supposing you

255
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,310
are born on the 10th story and

256
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,529
everybody's on the ground you must at

257
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,000
least make them climb two stories so

258
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,120
they know there's something about it

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,240
otherwise no use talking about it and he

260
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,820
said this is the mistake between the

261
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,260
Saints and the incarnations was that

262
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,540
they never realized that these people

263
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,190
are still on the ground they have to

264
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,779
still enter into the reading so that is

265
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:52,940
what you have to be very careful that

266
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,860
first of all you must give realization

267
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,709
to me

268
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,830
so I was seeking the ways and methods

269
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:03,320
working it out inside myself through my

270
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,209
own style of meditation in the sense

271
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,070
that I would work out all the

272
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,920
permutations and combinations supposing

273
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,200
I met one person then I would see what

274
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,200
problems that person had how you can

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,520
overcome it like that I would try to

276
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,920
study that person internally and I went

277
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,860
to many people find out but I found

278
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,110
everybody booklets I saw so many of

279
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,140
these gurus most of them I saw them I

280
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,770
was surprised they were all hypocrites

281
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:36,680
money making and staying and also I went

282
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,640
to Rajneesh also to see him then he said

283
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,959
that I should come to his table I didn't

284
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,700
know what sort of a man because he was

285
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,930
talking about eat and even things I

286
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,290
thought you might be knowing something

287
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,760
about it went that but my husband said

288
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:52,220
no I won't allow to go to

289
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,930
so he arranged his own mother no and all

290
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,120
that for me so I went down there and

291
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,250
there I couldn't see all the things that

292
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,980
were going on and that is the day

293
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,170
somehow or other I said I must open the

294
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,790
last chakra so the last chakra was open

295
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:10,190
and I saw the Kundalini which is the

296
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,820
primordial force within us which is the

297
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:19,190
Holy Ghost within us rising like a

298
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:23,240
telescope opening out and then I saw the

299
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,750
whole thing open and a big torrential

300
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,170
rain of grease started flowing through

301
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,180
my head all over as if and I felt I'm

302
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,000
lost now I have no more there it's only

303
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,860
that place is that the that is there I

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,070
saw it completely happening to me

305
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,990
and but I was amazed that when I went to

306
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,279
the Janine's you see because before

307
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
going out to say goodbye he never

308
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,870
realized what had happened or anything

309
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,899
else so I was surprised I said this man

310
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,130
doesn't know anything about God and then

311
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:00,829
I discovered that they were all

312
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:05,089
hypocrites and telling lies so in 1973

313
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:09,110
this happened on 5th of May 17 1970

314
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:11,329
fifth of May and just after that I we

315
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,399
had a very big lecture in Jahangir all

316
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,720
this already be gone and thousands of

317
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,180
people had to come I told them very

318
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,769
frankly that these are all thugs and

319
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,319
these are like this appropriate some of

320
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,300
them are demonic some are evil people I

321
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,279
took their names everything I told them

322
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,670
don't go near them there were some

323
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,740
foreigners also and there were so many

324
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,050
others whom I told these things very

325
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,430
clearly and they got frightened they

326
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,990
said you shouldn't say like this they

327
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,180
will come and murder you they will do I

328
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,279
said let them come and murder me but

329
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,600
nobody does anything nobody even went to

330
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:47,690
the courts and that's how you see they

331
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,699
tried to bring bad name to me they paid

332
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,889
money to the newspapers to publish

333
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,230
things against me because I said you

334
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:58,519
cannot pay money so they thought that I

335
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,290
was just trying to see harm them by

336
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,660
saying such a thing that you can't earn

337
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,270
money in the name of war if it's a job

338
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,420
you can

339
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:11,940
but God's work is not a job and the

340
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:15,270
struggle started from the day I started

341
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:17,910
giving realization and I started with

342
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:21,150
one lady know what realization first

343
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:24,390
then we got about 12 people who got

344
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:29,130
realization in two years I got only

345
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:31,440
about 14 people realization then

346
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,120
gradually went 14 people got realization

347
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,570
then many others started getting

348
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,440
realization but I started also curing

349
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:44,100
people because that was helping a lot

350
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,370
then my house my husband got elected to

351
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,260
this post and we had to come to London

352
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,210
so when I came to London we had one

353
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,000
program in party with everyone they

354
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,250
arranged it so the Indians abroad are

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,680
not so much interested in God they were

356
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,130
more interested in money so now the

357
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:05,280
Indian stayed there they all ran away

358
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:08,370
and only the foreigners who were there

359
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,080
when about seven hippies so I had to

360
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:15,030
work on them seven hippies for four

361
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,970
years I was working difficult to see the

362
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,850
earlier was back that inhale the head

363
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,670
was all terrible times but in between

364
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,110
eyes to go to India and in India also

365
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,630
the work was done for three months

366
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,180
always I would be in India so we started

367
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,100
working in the villages especially

368
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,960
surprisingly where my forefathers were

369
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,780
ruling in that area the were started

370
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,090
moving in a very big way and there then

371
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,690
we started taking some people from India

372
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:46,200
then some people came from Australia to

373
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,950
India like that and the work started

374
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,740
moving in those direction now gradually

375
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,720
the work improved and people found that

376
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,510
this is the way we can transform

377
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,440
ourselves many people were taking drugs

378
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,880
or alcohol or mad people answered people

379
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,070
they felt better

380
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,780
then they got cured and it was

381
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:12,360
established that sahaja yoga is

382
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:15,180
something really important now when I

383
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,159
travel all over the world you see first

384
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,639
of my husband used to pay for every

385
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,470
thing whenever I went she had to pay any

386
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:25,169
expenses he is to do for me

387
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,869
gradually then now these people pay for

388
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,899
my travel but otherwise they don't have

389
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:33,539
to pay for anything else that's how we

390
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:37,739
started our work there was a lot of

391
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:40,379
opposition and the media people would

392
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:44,099
never understand it because it was no

393
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:46,379
such a sensation as you can say nothing

394
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,299
to people feel excited but in a way it's

395
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,669
very great thing because if this is the

396
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,210
solution for the whole world one should

397
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:56,940
try to do it then we had very late

398
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:04,590
people who came to come to sahaja yoga

399
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:07,590
like we can say the High Court judge who

400
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:13,519
is now the president who has given

401
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:16,440
Nicaragua same judgment he and many

402
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:20,129
lawyers and many barristers we have one

403
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,529
barrister here from Algeria and doctors

404
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:25,289
and then they took over and they started

405
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:29,849
helping me out how to propagate sahaja

406
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:32,129
yoga but it was a difficult task in the

407
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:34,529
West of course in India it spread very

408
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:36,749
fast in the villages but City people in

409
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:38,970
India also are westernized and they

410
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:41,729
start analyzing they don't know much

411
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,950
about our past they don't know anything

412
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:46,349
about our heritage that we have over

413
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,789
Kundalini non that but some people do

414
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:50,220
know but self-realization

415
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,869
but these gurus could not stick on in

416
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,840
India because nobody would accept them

417
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:56,279
so it all ran away abroad and that was

418
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,849
something of blessing for me also

419
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:02,429
because I didn't have to fight them and

420
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:04,950
it started working out and then people

421
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:07,799
found that it helps in every way and

422
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:10,109
this found so many miracles about it and

423
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,169
that's how sahaja yoga what settled

424
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:15,690
quite a lot but still I would say that

425
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:19,049
we have not been to certain countries so

426
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:21,280
far and in the West I would say that so

427
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:34,139
much work has to be done

428
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:37,089
[Music]

429
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:39,039
as soon as you start any working

430
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:42,099
anyplace first of all they want me to

431
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,789
cure people and to help them with

432
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:48,129
curative now if I pay attention more to

433
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:50,559
that then the main work is to create

434
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:53,019
doctors out of everyone that is

435
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,239
neglected then you become unpopular they

436
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,219
think oh she's not sympathetic and this

437
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:59,109
and that but now as we have everybody

438
00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:01,539
can cure now everyone I don't cure

439
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,279
anyone directly but they don't like it

440
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:04,839
they want I should be there and there

441
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,599
you go to be pampered and all those

442
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:09,579
things are there rather difficult it's

443
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,979
not we are not running an election you

444
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,659
see like we should please other sort of

445
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:14,519
thing is not there but whatever is

446
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,879
reality

447
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:21,579
if a person has intelligence pure

448
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:23,950
intelligence we can see that this is

449
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:29,249
something very different and for that

450
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:34,450
one has to understand that you cannot

451
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:36,339
you cannot force on anyone that you get

452
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,739
your realization in the same way you

453
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:40,570
cannot force me that I give you

454
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:42,070
realization because if it does not work

455
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,899
it does not work with such a living

456
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:51,099
forces and that upsets them very soul I

457
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:54,969
feel that the way this Industrial

458
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:56,859
Revolution has come in the West people

459
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:59,289
have lost their moorings perhaps they

460
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:01,929
are so confused with all these gurus

461
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:04,029
coming down here confusing them and all

462
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,269
kinds of new things coming they don't

463
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:10,779
know where to look but unless and until

464
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:12,940
you get your evolution completed unless

465
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,309
and until you reach that absolute state

466
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:19,239
of understanding the chaos will remain

467
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:21,009
so one has to try to get to that but one

468
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:23,720
must understand you can't pay for it

469
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:36,040
there's no effort

470
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:39,260
[Music]

471
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:42,260
it's another great thing has happened in

472
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:46,580
Dell University that the Dell university

473
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:50,960
is accepted that a person can do only a

474
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:53,870
doctor can do a PhD or we can say the

475
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,220
doctorate in sahaja yoga and he gets the

476
00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:01,130
highest degree called the doctor of

477
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,990
medicine and a perhaps maybe after

478
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,840
sometime they will allow anyone to do

479
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,030
that this is about the medicine part of

480
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,980
it in agriculture we have done lots of

481
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,990
research myself you have somebody here

482
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,050
an expert on agriculture

483
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,600
he is also done lot of research and we

484
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:21,110
found out that with vibrations we start

485
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,650
after realization if you vibrate the

486
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:26,960
water and if you water the plants with

487
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,850
that then sometimes you might get even

488
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,970
ten times more breathe that's what they

489
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,010
did in India and one of the agricultural

490
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,380
university but here also he's found out

491
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,080
that this tremendous difference between

492
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:40,730
the growth of an ordinary thing another

493
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,180
thing we have found out in agriculture

494
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:48,440
that if you get vibrations then even an

495
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,690
ordinary cow can give lot of milk but if

496
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,310
you have hybrid cows then you see they

497
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,580
it's not good for the brain because a

498
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,770
person who takes hybrid make also gets

499
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,620
hybrid and his brain becomes little

500
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:03,980
wobbly so better to have a pure milk

501
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,470
from a cow which is not being put to

502
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,020
this kind of him experimentation

503
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,000
moreover food also if it's hybrid food

504
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,940
is not very good for us because that

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,920
spoils our nerves I think but ordinary

506
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,370
seats you cannot choose because they

507
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,340
have weakened and they cannot reproduce

508
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:23,420
so when we vibrate them they produce

509
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,880
very well

510
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,790
just like better than even sometimes

511
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,350
hybrid things and the food is taste very

512
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,510
well and he doesn't give those

513
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,510
complications so this can help in

514
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,700
agriculture in India and the government

515
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,160
has allotted a lot of land where we are

516
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,230
going to now experiment and we are going

517
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,720
to start the experimentation there to

518
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,760
show that how we can use this

519
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,240
but many farmers who are sahaja Yogi's

520
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,590
have done a lot of job and they have

521
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,970
discovered that even animals and this

522
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,940
what you call farming

523
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,120
everything is help very much my

524
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:12,429
vibration

525
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:14,490
[Music]

526
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,490
you

527
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:23,070
what do you think of the important

528
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:25,769
points in the education of children she

529
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,390
first if they if they get realization to

530
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,640
get trust them to that point of

531
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,380
realization if they're already born

532
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,110
realized no problem but if they have

533
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,029
their given realization then you see

534
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,039
they start seeing from a different level

535
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:43,350
they become the spirit so their self

536
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:45,870
respect to see awaken so children behave

537
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:48,690
in a very dignified elderly man are you

538
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:51,000
see they talk in a very elderly manner

539
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,120
and this gives solutions of all kinds

540
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,940
you see and there are tremendous people

541
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,880
but we have to guide them properly by

542
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,220
our own behavior how we behave the

543
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,480
greatest thing is how we behave that's

544
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:10,740
how the children run we put the children

545
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:12,330
certain to some tests how they are we

546
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,760
find out if they have any physical

547
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:17,130
problems we cure them with a mental

548
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,039
problem we cure them if they have any

549
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,289
other problem social problem or anything

550
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,899
we try to help them out so that

551
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:27,870
basically if a human being is all right

552
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,549
in the childhood then fundamentals are

553
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,769
all right for the child the foundation

554
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,100
is laid down then to build that child up

555
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:38,279
into a good quality is not difficult so

556
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,610
now we find like a great artist on there

557
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,260
there are three positions and at a very

558
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,330
young age they have started being well

559
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,549
why lean I mean suddenly they have

560
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,860
become dynamic also and very humble

561
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,260
they're very humble and self-respecting

562
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,960
and very well-behaved it's surprising

563
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,419
how atmosphere is and how it works out

564
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,149
and the other day the lady asked me

565
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,639
about the women and I told her that a

566
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:04,919
woman's power as a mother is very great

567
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,480
she felt hurt about it but I didn't mean

568
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,610
that you should be just a mother what

569
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,610
I'm saying she is a mother means she's

570
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,279
compassionate she's kind she's not

571
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,230
aggressive like man that is a very big

572
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,850
quality that's a very big power in a

573
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,980
woman that's what I was suggesting that

574
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,350
that is what we have brought us not to

575
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:27,760
compete with men it's madness we have to

576
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:33,110
understand that life has to be

577
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,780
in job nights be a blessing not to be a

578
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:40,990
misery we create our own miseries by

579
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:43,460
these false ideas by our own con

580
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,160
confusions we have in our mind mental

581
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,890
projections we have in our mind or our

582
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,070
own obstinacy whatever it is all these

583
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,480
things can be cured if you take to

584
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,820
sahaja yoga because you've become a

585
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,710
balanced person level-headed wise person

586
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,320
and you become a witness the whole thing

587
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,970
becomes like a show like a drama and you

588
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,890
become fearless you start seeing the

589
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,020
whole thing like a drama and this is

590
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,590
what a human being has to achieve we

591
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:11,900
talk of peace we talk of no war we talk

592
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,360
of many things like this you see atomic

593
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,370
bomb this that all that is not going to

594
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,860
work out only what is going to work out

595
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,660
is the transformation of human beings if

596
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,480
the human beings are transformed things

597
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,080
will work out absolutely first-class not

598
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:30,230
only that but that they will enjoy the

599
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,950
Bliss of life we are missing the point

600
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:36,800
altogether this is a very important

601
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,720
thing that human beings must say one

602
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:43,360
thing what have you achieved out of all

603
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:56,490
this just for a minute to stop and think

604
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:59,800
[Music]

605
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:02,410
or illnesses are caused by the

606
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,990
imbalances in within us by our extreme

607
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,810
behavior and supposing say now the

608
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:11,440
cancer we can take the cancer is cancer

609
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:15,150
is caused by the over activity of the

610
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:20,200
sympathetic nervous system supposing a

611
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,960
person is a very sad person he cries and

612
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,150
we said all the times feels guilty and

613
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,490
thinks that he's the first person ever

614
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:30,370
born he's committed so many sins and all

615
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,710
sorts of nonsense he then he goes to the

616
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,420
left side according to us and crosses

617
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,210
over to the collective subconscious area

618
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:41,020
and there according to us what they call

619
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,550
as protein 58 and protein 52 doctors

620
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,610
call it that way but we call it as the

621
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,130
Dead Souls they existed and they catch

622
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,800
hold of you and they trigger the cancer

623
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,250
but supposing by any chance you can

624
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,160
bring the attention fully away from that

625
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,650
in the center you can get your so it is

626
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,160
the centers within us which are subtle

627
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:05,440
which are basically seven centers there

628
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,060
are many others but basically seven if

629
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,600
you can put them right you cannot have

630
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:23,519
any sickness or illness of any kind

631
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:26,259
[Music]

632
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,899
- he was a tremendous man one has to

633
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:32,169
learn a lot from him he was not taller

634
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:36,039
he put it that's one thing and he was

635
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:38,529
not like modern he says the politicians

636
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,320
who say something to something no it's

637
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:45,669
very outspoken and always he put himself

638
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,909
on the testing point and he used to

639
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:51,279
confess if you made mistakes immediately

640
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:54,039
one very great incident I remember when

641
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,729
I was a small child they were having a

642
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:01,029
meeting together and we got stood there

643
00:31:57,729 --> 00:32:03,659
only sitting giving them water and

644
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:07,119
things to all the people all the big

645
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:09,699
people were there like Yamaha Leo was

646
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,679
there and also Maulana Azad all these

647
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:14,169
people who are sitting there no

648
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,299
discussing something and then suddenly

649
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:20,739
not when he said that now it's very late

650
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:22,839
we'll have lunch air so they said yes

651
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:24,609
this we'll have lunch here they had to

652
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:28,449
go to the guest house which was far away

653
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:31,089
so but what he asked for the mice

654
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:33,339
through his wife shared one out so he

655
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:35,499
got up he had a key with him he always

656
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:38,859
of the storeroom you opened the store

657
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:39,729
and he asked the people who were in

658
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:42,789
charge of cooking

659
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:45,190
to measure everything according to the

660
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:48,190
people there are properly everything you

661
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,139
see and then he when they measured it

662
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,569
out everything was done then he put the

663
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:56,739
key back and then he went inside then

664
00:32:52,569 --> 00:32:59,409
ask so these people said we did not know

665
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:05,259
you have to take so much trouble you see

666
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:08,859
too much time out fifteen minutes but

667
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:11,229
still so he said what do you think this

668
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:13,839
is the blood of my country I cannot

669
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:16,359
allow it to be wasted see that's the

670
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,459
sign of a person who understands the

671
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:22,269
value of public money that's just

672
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:25,599
ingrained in him but those who saw him

673
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:28,359
also felt that look at this man who is

674
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:30,369
living like a ascetic absolutely in the

675
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:33,789
sense that he would not touch the public

676
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:35,559
money and that is one of the key keys

677
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:40,029
for all the leaders if they are

678
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,279
absolutely about money then only people

679
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:45,069
with respect otherwise there's no way

680
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:47,759
out but you find these days in every

681
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:51,749
country so much of corruption hypocrisy

682
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,749
we were really shocked
