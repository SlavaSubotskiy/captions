1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,900
For the flowers?

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,340
This is mummy has done for you? It's very sweet one.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,300
This one is?

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,580
Wood.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,140
No, no, no, it started now. You see a little bit of...

6
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,020
Just the thing that we feed.

7
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,740
See these flowers.

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,700
Are they nice?

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,180
The flowers...

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,900
Are they nice flowers?

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,940
Such a smiling baby.

12
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,540
Such a sweet baby.

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,060
Such a nice baby.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
You must smile.

15
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,340
You must smile.

16
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,020
Are they still like a nervous person? And...

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
What's the Mishon's daughter's name is?

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,380
Marina.

19
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,700
Marina.

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,020
Marina, ha.

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,260
She also looses a little bit of her balance, with aarti.

22
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,500
Yeah. Very good.

23
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,580
You are feeling sleepy.

24
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,860
Very quiet, ah?

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,540
She's very good Mother.

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,340
She's very quiet.

27
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,380
Even Pauline's daughter has improved a lot.

28
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,500
Good.

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,460
Very much better now, very much better.

30
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,500
William's [apetite is] very much by this..

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,780
I think that work would suit him the best.

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,140
He did a very good job in our house, you see...

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,420
And C.P. liked his things that he had cooked and made Me happy..

34
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,420
I had such a problem, I didn't know what to do because you see it's,

35
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:18,620
C.P. won't eat anything and I thought now to give up and go away.

36
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,820
But who told Me was [Pray].

37
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,380
She said, "William is a very good cook, if he can help there."

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,180
I thought, "If he's working, how will he do it?"

39
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,460
But he did it very well.

40
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,540
You see, Mr. Srivastava eats very little, but

41
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,420
if it is good, tasty food then he'll eat, all right.

42
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,860
She's feeling sleepy now.

43
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,820
Feeling sleepy?

44
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,980
All right?

45
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,260
You don't smile at all, isn't it?

46
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,540
And then it is enough to put a lipstick [unclear] completely.

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,620
All right, all right.

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,900
All right, now, just do it.

49
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Crawls? Does she? Does she crawl a little?

50
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,700
Yes, Mother, she does.

51
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,580
Now, gone away.

52
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,020
From the distance, smiling.

53
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,180
What's  her age now?

54
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,299
She's eight months old.

55
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,700
Slowly, she'll sit down upon you.

56
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,060
But she's now a very sweet child, I must say.

57
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,020
She doesn't trouble at all.

58
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,420
In the beginning you had problems,

59
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,140
Yes, a lot.

60
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,260
Because you have comitted some mistakes I think, about her.

61
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,220
You didn't know.

62
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,060
But you are rather thin now. What's the problem?

63
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,540
You are nursing her?

64
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,100
Yes, Mother.

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,620
And no other milk?

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,300
No, I haven't been using other milk.

67
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,020
I've been travelling so much that I haven't had time to do it.

68
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,940
Travelling where? To Exeter?

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,180
Yes, Mother.

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,580
How is it? They have got an ashram now in Exeter?

71
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,180
Devon town at least.

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,740
No, another one.

73
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,780
Or somebody told Me, very near.

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,780
What's her name? The one with a pink frock who came?

75
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh, Carol.

76
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,900
No, no, no.

77
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,340
Carol's friend I think, the one who came with a pink frock to Loose.

78
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,420
What's her name?

79
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Carol, Carol, Mother.

80
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,100
She, she's also Carol?

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,580
Yes, that's Carol.

82
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,420
She lives in Totnes.

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,740
She said Dartington.

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,380
That's right.Yes.

85
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,780
And she said she has,

86
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,900
they have got an ashram there now, in that place. Good idea.

87
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,700
They are very good.

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,660
They are very good.

89
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,300
So, she said now there are three, three persons only,

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,780
but she hopes to get more.

91
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,420
Sahaja Yoga grows you see very slowly, no doubt about it,

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,260
but it's better to have solid people than to have half baked.

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
You know I'm very thankful to you, you solved really My problem.

94
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,660
You don't know I would have given up,

95
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,260
and I would have come back, really.

96
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,980
Chance to you.

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,980
[It's a bit short], please eat your food and....

98
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,420
You liked the Italians. They are very interesting people.

99
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,340
Very interesting.

100
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,500
I'll be coming to Italy in, I think, september or so.

101
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,180
There, I start from the 24-th of August,

102
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,180
till the fifteenth of September or fourteenth of September,

103
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,900
my journey in Switzerland, Austria and Italy, these three countries.

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,020
I don't know how Gregoire has put it

105
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
but I will also get the whole program here.

106
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,660
But, you have got your passport?

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I'll go and get it.

108
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,060
It's, it's in my thing, I packed it away with...

109
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,020
Where?

110
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,380
In Sally's house.

111
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, I see. And yours?

112
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,500
She's keeping my things.

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I've got my passport.

114
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,420
You have got it. Yours is there.

115
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,940
You don't have to have a passport yourself,

116
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,260
you have to have a visa, that's all.

117
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,900
I don't know.

118
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,660
You don't have to ask for visa?

119
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,420
I don't think so. I've got an Irish passport, Mother.

120
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,940
No, but you have to take visa to get to Italy and Europe.

121
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,100
All of you, isn't it?

122
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,740
So they don't even need a passport.

123
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,700
To go to Italy?

124
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,620
No, no. It's in Common Market so no visa is necessary.

125
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,260
Irish is also in Common Market, Mother, so she's at safe. No problem.

126
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,820
No problem?

127
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,380
Then when are you going?

128
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,260
We have to wait for Isabel and Guido to tell us when we should go.

129
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,140
But I have already written to them.

130
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,980
Well, we can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, Mother.

131
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,660
We can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, on 31-st, and then

132
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,140
as soon as we can get it running after that we'll go.

133
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,740
So [with our ladies taking up] we can settle.

134
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,820
No, the letter I have seen,

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,780
saying that they want immediately Sahaja Yogis there.

136
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,500
So why don't you telephone and find out?

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,740
Gilbert mentioned that he telephoned last night or the night before

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,740
and Isabel said she would talk to Guido,

139
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,940
because we have a child. So...

140
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,780
No, but tell them that Mother said that she, it's all right.

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,060
Yes.

142
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,580
All right?

143
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,340
Yes.

144
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Gilbert? Should I tell Gilbert?

145
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,900
Gilbert? No it's not neccessary.

146
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,260
Will you please tell her to telephone to these people in Italy, yeah?

147
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
But Pedro it's there. I'll tell Pedro.

148
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,220
Would You like to meet him Mother? Would You like to meet him now?

149
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,380
No I will tell that to Guruji.

150
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,620
It's not there.

151
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,700
Instead I hope you were not dissapointed with the number.

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,780
But I think they must have gone to see the match.

153
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,060
Or might be seeing it on the TV.

154
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,780
Yes.

155
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,900
Their priorities are very wrong and thank God they lost it.

156
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,620
Oh. Four-zero, four-zero.

157
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,860
Oh, no.

158
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,060
Good.

159
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,740
It could teach Robson a lesson Mother. He can't goes on it.

160
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,220
Who can't go?

161
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,540
Robson.

162
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,380
He's lost for PP, Mother.

163
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,460
He gambled with his teacher?

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,860
No, with, with friends at school.

165
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,020
He should have asked Me.

166
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,380
Forgive their confidence, Mother.

167
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,140
And ask the vibrations.

168
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,860
Even I am here why do you think they had to go?

169
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,340
So they had to loose.

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,820
I think tomorrow you might get more people.

171
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,180
Give a bandhan to all the Brighton seekers.

172
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,700
Ten times. Come forward, come forward, come forward, all of you.

173
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,580
Their priorities are wrong.

174
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,140
I don't know when will they be all right.

175
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,460
When they are going to hear Your voice

176
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,540
and see Your picture, Mother, maybe then.

177
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,580
Maybe when they are going to hear Your voice and see Your picture,

178
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,100
maybe then their priorities will be right.

179
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,860
I don't know.

180
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,100
You see, London is a difficult place and that's it.

181
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,500
But England is even worse. Even worse, you know.

182
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,380
But the other places like Austria, now just imagine.

183
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,860
I have been there only once.

184
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,860
We had seventy people for the Puja.

185
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,940
Seventy people came for the Sahasrar Puja.

186
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,380
Now, this place Geneva, sixty-five people.

187
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,660
I mean for Puja we have very limited number or

188
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,460
very selected people, you know.

189
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,460
And sixty-five.

190
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,860
Can you believe it? Geneva itself. Then Laussanne, it's all separate.

191
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,020
You can imagine?

192
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,940
They are so sluggish, these people.

193
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,900
Very sluggish.

194
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,460
They are seekers no doubt.

195
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,540
Very sluggish seekers.

196
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
Moreover they are attacked, so much, so much attacked.

197
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,460
And this left sided attack is so much.

198
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,540
My thing was so full of it, I tell you.

199
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,700
When I came all My this foot it didn't allow Me to walk.

200
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,740
It was so caught up all this left side.

201
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,300
So many things like that are happening in Brighton, I think.

202
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
And the whole left is absolutely caught up.

203
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,860
It started from, of course, Victoria.

204
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,380
But here when I got down, this is the problem,

205
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,020
really stumbling the left.

206
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,220
Mother, in university we had so many false gurus,

207
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,580
and there are some brothers that followed them,

208
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,820
who [managed] the things and who tried to get...

209
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,220
Now they have run away, all of their students.

210
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,500
Well there are buddhists in the campus and [unclear] to get it.

211
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,540
They'll take them to Shambala. Buddhists.

212
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,260
And then they are taking tea among Life Poet whole center.

213
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,980
[There is tea guy?]

214
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,300
Yes. And Life Poet.

215
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Life Poet, Mother, it's an offshoot of that Raktabija fellow.

216
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,140
What are [they doing]?

217
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,300
They've got some guru that they send in the

218
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,500
East or somewhere, of Malayesia...

219
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,180
His name is Klaus or something.

220
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,700
What did you say? I didn't hear...

221
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,380
He is, he is, I think he is named like Derek Klaus or something...

222
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,220
Derek what?

223
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,380
He's Herbert, Herbert Job.

224
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:48,860
So however he's called Mother, he's horrid. Herbert Job.

225
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,980
She's like Olympia, see. From very childhood Olympia was like this.

226
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,380
You are hungry. It's good.

227
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,540
So all these are taking you know, a [deed] from Indians.

228
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,180
They think why not we also have an entreprise, you see.

229
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,020
But I was told that

230
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,340
in England people don't take Indian people very seriously.

231
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm sorry, I can't give you this. You don't have teeth to eat that.

232
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,380
Gregoire was saying that, what we should do.

233
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:54,300
We should get Indian Sahaja Yogis for England.

234
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,820
We should send English Sahaja Yogis for India.

235
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,740
It's like that.

236
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,700
What's this?

237
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,340
You can just put it that way.

238
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,940
No, I use the hands sometimes, see.

239
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,740
This?

240
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,460
A little.

241
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,340
Whatever you may say, you see, so whatever goes on like that.

242
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,700
But serious Sahaja Yogis we get, is better than to have too many.

243
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,460
They are much better.

244
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,260
Have serious Sahaja Yogis who get into it, who settle down,

245
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,940
than to have too many people in the program.

246
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,740
We had so many before also, you see.

247
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,500
All sorts of things. How many came out of that?

248
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,780
Cause in any case even if you get hundreds,

249
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,380
out of that only, say, you will get about ten.

250
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
So why not have the ten?

251
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
That's real economics, here.

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,180
That's real economics.

253
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,020
Yes, it's real economics is.

254
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,980
So what's the use?  I'm wasting your energy with them.

255
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,420
You see, they are so many, so you waste more energy with them.

256
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,980
And they are all useless.

257
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,100
Can't take them anywhere.

258
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,620
So what's the use of fighting with them, useless people.

259
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,300
And their Kundalini rising after ten years,

260
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,700
like a mountain to raise they've given us.

261
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,660
But not in India. In India it's very good.

262
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,980
I mean if there are hundred persons at least ninety will turn right.

263
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,780
But if I have it here, ten.

264
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,420
This is the proportion.

265
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,260
That's why in India it is growing like that.

266
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,100
Everytime, even if I go to them or not.

267
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,460
I find about fifty, sixty people, like that.

268
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,140
Everytime, can you imagine?

269
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,300
In Bombay, of course, much more.

270
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,540
Bombay has got I think seven or eight centers all together.

271
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,860
In the Bombay city itself, very well running.

272
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,660
Which is so much so, that now, for the program we had,

273
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,220
My birthday program,

274
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,300
we had and the big hall was having

275
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,540
about twelve hudred to fifteen hundred people.

276
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,300
It was so filled that outside when I did arrive,

277
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,340
that they asked Me to arrive little later,

278
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,260
I couldn't go in. It was, people had to push side.

279
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,820
And when My brothers came little later,

280
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,940
they said, "We just didn't know how are we going, to whom."

281
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,180
Then one third they were,

282
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,060
many more seniors ones, all were Sahaja Yogis practically.

283
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,820
But we had invited about three to four hundred people extra.

284
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,980
They all were there, on the first seat.

285
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:13,460
And the Deputee Minister, Deputee Chief Minister was present there.

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,660
But you won't know they have, you see, just like as you have here,

287
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,060
Peter Shore and all that, they have very important leaders, you see.

288
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,700
Comunist Party, then we have one very extreme party called Shiv Sena,

289
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,020
which is a fanatic party of Shivaji's, fanatic party.

290
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,940
I mean I'd rather difficult I think to eat this one.

291
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,380
It's not breaking.

292
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,980
Would You like a knife Mother?

293
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,500
[No, it's all right].

294
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,220
I'm not very good at all these things, I think.

295
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,900
It's not breaking at all but I'll manage. Managed, managed, managed.

296
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
[Hindi]

297
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,460
And all these people, extremes, all kinds of extremes,

298
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,380
then all kinds of these leaders, members of the Assembly and all that.

299
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,940
some ministers, all have come,

300
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:25,140
and sitting on the same platform, can you imagine,

301
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,580
for My birthday.

302
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,380
And the greatest position, you must have heard, in India, is pandit.

303
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,780
[unclear]

304
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,860
And he didn't take any money.

305
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,660
He said, "For Mother's birthday I'm not going to take any money".

306
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,260
That kind of an attitude sure you can't expect here.

307
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,260
Of course not.

308
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,540
But you'll be amazed, in India, how many days I've worked, you know.

309
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,580
I started, say in 1970, may. Slowly everything grew.

310
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:11,260
So, '71, '72, '73, '74, and you see now.

311
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,580
Ten years have passed in Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:32,420
Seekers are amazing. And in Bombay, I am there hardly for ten days.

313
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,460
When I'll go, ten days, fifteen days, at the most.

314
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,740
In Delhi about ten, fifteen days.

315
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,820
In Maharashtra I was a month, at the most.

316
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,860
So, you can imagine.

317
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,780
And how many things, I mean not only on this land

318
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,380
that we have Sahaja Yogis,

319
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,220
but that governement has given us land, people have given us land.

320
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,420
So many things have happened in India. And I feel that

321
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,660
India is the place where Sahaja Yoga will be really established.

322
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,740
Besides I would like to be established more in London.

323
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,700
But what can we do? How far can we go with these horrible people?

324
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,660
The media is hopeless.

325
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,980
And dr. Naveen Singh is the, is the president

326
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,340
of the Great High Court, Royal High Court. He presided in Delhi.

327
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,020
You must get his, you must get his tapes, you see.

328
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,580
Why not write to somebody?

329
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,740
We were at Bhopal and I wanted to talk to him.

330
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,620
Tomorrow we'll try if we can get him on the phone.

331
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,180
And the chief, I mean the Deputy Chief Minister,

332
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,260
He spoke very highly about Sahaja Yoga.

333
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,180
Here, what to do?

334
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,660
Then maybe it needs some, a breakthrough, one or two proeminent people

335
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,500
getting Realization, recognizing You Mother.

336
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,300
Maybe we need a breakthrough, some, one or two proeminent people,

337
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,580
getting Realization and recognizing You.

338
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,940
[Hindi]. They are horrible. I meet them every day.

339
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,100
They think they are perfect.

340
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,060
I mean it's not even one or two, Mother?

341
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,540
No, no, it's very impossible.

342
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,460
Horrible.

343
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,900
Horrible.

344
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,940
This lord Hailsham was sitting next to Me in a dinner.

345
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,299
And dr. Naveen Singh was next by him.

346
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:04,420
Dr. Naveen told him, "This lady is a very famous,

347
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,060
saint of area, with whom you are sitting."

348
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,700
Immediately he said, "I'm also a very famous saint, like that".

349
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,260
Imagine that,  he got his ahamkara, in hindi.

350
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,580
Stupid.

351
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,380
And next day his wife fell from the horse and died.

352
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,580
At eighty, eighty years of age. Imagine this mad woman eighty years.

353
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,460
Such a mad modernism.

354
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,460
Oh, his nick name is "Bonkers Hogg".

355
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,820
Bonkers.

356
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,580
Bonkers.

357
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,100
Bonkers. Bonkers.

358
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,580
Bonkers. Really?

359
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,260
He's called Bonkers.

360
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,780
That's all they say so.

361
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,900
Really, I say that.

362
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,180
Horrible.

363
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,620
I mean he just said immediately,

364
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,260
without anything in mind, without any humillity.

365
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,540
And dr. Naveen Singh, you know.

366
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,540
He said, "This man is full of ego, Ahamkara".

367
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,260
Just can't do it.

368
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,580
What can you do?

369
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,780
I've cured some very important people like this fellow,

370
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,420
this one I've brought.

371
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,140
He talks very highly of Me, you said.

372
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,940
That Indian...

373
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,500
Dr. [Athler].

374
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,380
He gave Me a book.

375
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,500
But he said " I am an archetype also." Thank you.

376
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,740
I don't know what all that is.

377
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,140
Even Grant you see, he wrote letters after letters to Me,

378
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
"Mother accept me as your disciple".

379
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,180
And he gave of course an introduction to Don's book no doubt. But,

380
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,700
he would not circulate the book, nothing.

381
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,500
He would not send it to his people, nothing of the kind.

382
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,500
He's so money minded.

383
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,380
"So if I publish it, then I  will."

384
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,540
That means you came for the publishing.

385
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,540
There is no genuineness left in people anymore.

386
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,820
In India you'll be surprised [as well].

387
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,380
Part of it the money we paid, no doubt, we paid part of it.

388
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,820
But part of it was given. They gave Me the paper free.

389
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,820
Here was never [unclear] even if they think to Mother.

390
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,180
Printing free. So many things they did free for Me.

391
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,780
All this is Mother's why should She pay.

392
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,500
They have no sense of saintliness left.

393
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,380
This horrible thing like,

394
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:52,260
"[unclear], I'm going to do that". I don't know how will you manage.

395
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,660
But still we must not be so much in despair.

396
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,299
You see, according to Me it's a great progress in England.

397
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,980
Because after all these are not artificial, these are real things.

398
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,940
So real diamonds are rare, isn't it?

399
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,940
They have to.

400
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,620
I never expected really, to be very frank, in the beginning

401
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,460
that we'll have so many Sahaja Yogis in London.

402
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,100
So I'm overjoyed, whatever it is.

403
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,580
But you people should not feel depressed, at all.

404
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,180
And if you see the other side of it,

405
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,060
lots of things they are doing, like registration.

406
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,540
You see, it is giving such a boost to us, because now Australians,

407
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,100
are so slavish.

408
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,740
They said, "If it is done in England we'll accept it here".

409
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,380
Authonom. No problem.

410
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,700
They'll not question anything, they'll not say anything.

411
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,860
They'll just accept. Can you believe it?

412
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,180
Thing like that.

413
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,100
And I'm sure Americans may say the same.

414
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,380
They'll not reason definetely.

415
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,860
"Was done in England, then it's all right.

416
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,420
England are always, English are always correct."

417
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,940
And it is going to help also French. Do you know that?

418
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,900
France is the liver.

419
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,220
Some sort of a thing has happened in France.

420
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,100
I think that's why I felt that this labourhood when it comes in,

421
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,620
people will be threaten, that maybe tomorrow communism may come.

422
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
They will turn more towards God.

423
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,780
That's what I felt we should go for.

424
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,180
The fear, you see.

425
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,580
Psychological fear.

426
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,900
Like, like in Russia, I've seen.

427
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,620
To them to be Christian is good, you see, if they are martyrs.

428
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,580
All stupid people, no doubt, I must say.

429
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,140
I think,

430
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,380
that I was wondering whom to vote of course. Let's see.

431
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,420
Is Gavin going back tonight?

432
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,700
Yes, Mother.

433
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,660
What time?

434
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,940
I think they went straight from the program.

435
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,380
Then [they went already].

436
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,780
Yes, is rather cold.

437
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,140
They told Me that.

438
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,380
She would be

439
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,980
back tomorrow itself, at the evening program.

440
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,220
Who told You that? Christine?

441
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,180
Gavin was very dissapointed to them. They'll not pick the program.

442
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,780
That's the way these people are, this way.

443
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,299
So, what did they suggest then?

444
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,820
Sorry Mother.

445
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,299
To you about that advertisment.

446
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,620
So Mother, they told me that You discussed it again and

447
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,820
that it was best to leave it for the moment,

448
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,620
for the day if the man from IPO was going to come.

449
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,020
He'll maybe come on Tuesday.

450
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,220
Yes, I told him that.

451
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,860
There's no use use pursueing these people.

452
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,300
They are not suspicious of the tasks.

453
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,820
Among suspicions is the furniture polish and the [unclear] lacquer.

454
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,100
I know it poisons [that apetite] in some televisions. That's all.

455
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,660
Doesn't matter.

456
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,100
Good, for that they'll have a big drama, no?

457
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,299
Since you will crash.

458
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,980
And then from a crashed thing,

459
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,820
a big ice you know, from Himalaya, it will come from the bottom.

460
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,540
And if it is serious then you must know it, this is what it is.

461
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,260
So an idea is [unclear].

462
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,140
Today the people we've got, they are good people.

463
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,980
I think they will all come round and settle down.

464
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,900
Would be good idea.

465
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,820
We should not feel dissapointed and worried.

466
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,620
It will be all right.

467
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,140
Because I think mentally they understood Sahaja Yoga.

468
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,260
And it's better to have really serious Sahaja Yogis.

469
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,660
Or they give such a headache otherwise, isn't it?

470
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,860
What has happened to Phil?

471
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Phil, who used to come in London.

472
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,420
Who was working with the.... Phil, what about him?

473
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,820
There is no news about him, Mother.

474
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,380
He went to Scotland?

475
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,820
Yes.

476
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,860
And I think [he might be again in Brighton].

477
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,180
Nobody got some news so far.

478
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,100
No, no, because you see he wanted to marry that girl,

479
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,740
he wanted to marry some girl, there. Phil.

480
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,980
He asked Me about her. I told him, "All right, go ahead".

481
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,380
He stayed at Suzan's place first and all that.

482
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,820
Somebody must find out about him.

483
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,180
Maybe this girl has ruined him, I don't know.

484
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,860
But he told Me, "Mother, she is... quite happy with Sahaja Yoga."

485
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,660
I said, "All right, go and marry, don't worry. Nothing to worry.

486
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,780
For us you can come anytime. We get you married."

487
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,940
You must ask John what has happen?

488
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,100
He wanted to marry very badly, no doubt.

489
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,540
We couldn't get a Sahaja Yogini to marry him, whatever it was.

490
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,540
Cause this girl, he said, is good, she is, he asked for permission.

491
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,900
I said,"All right.

492
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,140
If you think that she comes to Sahaja Yoga, its all right".

493
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,100
Mother, help one yogi. There is a Sahaja Yogi in Edinburgh and...

494
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Where?

495
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,500
There is someone in Edingburgh who comes across to Glasgow

496
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,660
[time to time] to see John and Cathy.

497
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
They said they've seen Flint looking ill.

498
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,980
He doesn't live in very good condition.

499
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,700
He seemed to be getting back to his old ways, when they saw him.

500
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,299
Old man?

501
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,980
They said he was, he didn't look very well.

502
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,700
But what is his age?

503
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,220
He is, must be twenty-two, twenty-three, not much older.

504
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,980
I don't know I received a letter from an old man who stays in Scotland.

505
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,540
And he has been to Sahaja Yoga center. He's trying.

506
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,260
Nothing works out.

507
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,940
He is doing footsoak and everything,

508
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,540
I don't know from where he wrote to Me.

509
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
But his health is not all right? This fellow's?

510
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,020
No. These persons have seen Kingsley Flint.

511
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,300
Is that Flint?

512
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,940
Yes, they said that Flint looked ill, when they saw him.

513
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,780
There is someone who comes from Edinburgh, to visit Glasgow,

514
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,100
and they told John that they've seen Kingsley

515
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,940
and apparentely he wasn't looking well, that he, he looked sick.

516
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,180
Is it?

517
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,299
That fellow told?

518
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,620
Yes.

519
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,340
We should ask John to go and have a look.

520
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,740
Could be.

521
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,180
And maybe he started taken to drugs.

522
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,500
Possibly.

523
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,900
I remarked the one, very sensible boy.

524
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,900
I don't know after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

525
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,740
and living with it for so many years, how can you go back to drugs?

526
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,940
After knowing what it is done to you.

527
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:09,420
But possibly, possibly.

528
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,540
I'm sure they'll find out.

529
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,300
And talk to John.

530
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,980
But Gavin was telling Me that still,

531
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,100
Scotland is to be worked out.

532
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,860
It's not yet to be regarded as a Sahaja Yoga center.

533
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,380
We'll have to work it out more, Gavin was saying.

534
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,620
Gavin is from Scotland and he feels concerned, you know.

535
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,660
Let's see.

536
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,980
You see we wanted to start that organization to show how these

537
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,420
gurus have harmed us and all that.

538
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,940
But now it's not necessary, they are all finished, [back to the hell].

539
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:26,980
All the people who are sort of regarded as something in this country,

540
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,900
are already believing in some things [and sort of].

541
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,660
Impossible to bring anyone near Sahaja Yoga.

542
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,340
I'll tell you about Peter Shore.

543
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,260
One day he was sitting next to Me in a dinner.

544
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,060
He said, "You look very happy person". I said, "I am".

545
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,780
He said, "I am not".

546
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,140
He said. So the wife of Michael Foot was next to Me.

547
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,180
He said, "Are you happy person?"

548
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,460
She said, " Not at all, I'm a very unhappy person".

549
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,380
"Look at Mrs. Srivastava, is a happy person.

550
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,100
But I can't understand, She must be ignorant about world affairs".

551
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,580
You see, the wife of Michael Foot,

552
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,980
she said, "Must be. It's better to be ignorant, she says,

553
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,180
so that at least you can be happy".

554
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,340
And then they started discussing their miseries, both of them,

555
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,700
and I didn't argue.

556
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:44,380
And the Conservatives and all these, making fun of the Queen.

557
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,620
And the party they had at the Queen,

558
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,940
what happened and, all these, imagine.

559
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,660
I think some calamity will [happen].

560
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:51,140
If, if, Labor comes in, they will, they will take to God.

561
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,620
I mean [inter-injury], before becoming comunist, let us take to God.

562
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,340
But they are also saying for instance that I've told them.

563
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,220
He asked Me to whom to vote,

564
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,420
and then I said, "You vote the [Comission] now".

565
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,060
How can you decide with these three types of people.

566
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,220
But at least that he has been really,

567
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,860
Shirley and William have been sincere to ask.

568
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,780
I've met her also, quite often.

569
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,140
But this has started looking like [unclear] or so. They cheat.

570
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,220
All right with [unclear], Mother.

571
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,460
But it's wonderful you are doing...

572
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,140
Is it a jasmin tea or?

573
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,260
What tea is this?

574
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,740
I think Mother, it is jasmin tea. It is jasmin tea.

575
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,220
But today what was the situation with the younger boys

576
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,900
who were on the left hand side?

577
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,620
How do you find them?

578
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,500
You were all there?

579
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,940
The left hand side.

580
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,700
Which ones, Mother?

581
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,860
Those which are sitting on the left hand side or the younger people.

582
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,020
You were there.

583
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,260
Anyhow it's crucial for them Mother.

584
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,860
How was there?

585
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,740
One needs patience.

586
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,340
Not the one needs patience? And the other one?

587
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,299
The other one was [unclear].

588
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,340
Then he was all right. No?

589
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,100
After some talk only this happened.

590
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,340
He can if he wants.

591
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,740
But how, what was his reaction?

592
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,300
Positive I think.

593
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,020
Positive. Because of them.

594
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,340
He's a friend of mine, Mother. He's a friend of mine.

595
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,620
He's a friend of mine.

596
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,020
Really?

597
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:20,380
Yeah. He didn't feel very much but he sees that there's something.

598
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,180
But he could sort of see it.

599
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,740
At the Agnya?

600
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,420
But it's not then [unclear].

601
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,580
Ekadesha.

602
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,540
[unclear] and a lot of that talks and [cheap things / cheatting].

603
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,060
How do you think? It depends, I mean...

604
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,380
I think they are Catholics but I don't think he's some,

605
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,860
I mean he's taken drugs but not much, I mean sort of thing.

606
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,780
Drugs? He's a Catholic.

607
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,820
There's a double reaction.

608
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,220
It's a double action.

609
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,860
Right side.

610
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,860
Oh, he will be all right.

611
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,460
He looks positive.

612
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,540
They have found out a new place they were telling.

613
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,260
Kevin, did you tell him that?

614
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:18,820
Yes Mother.

615
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,860
And tomorrow you...

616
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,660
I don't [hear something]: book it, book it.

617
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,540
Better, better book it immediately.

618
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,540
Or tomorrow you go and do it.

619
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:32,820
Or you have to pay somemoney there?

620
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,700
Mother, I didn't book yet say in Laussane

621
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,299
but we'll talk it out tomorrow, Mother.

622
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,740
You better take some money with you, in any case.

623
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,140
I'll take, I'll take some in case they needed [at earnest], Mother,

624
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,660
so I could take it, in any case,

625
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,460
but usually these places is telling to [unclear].

626
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,780
Yes, they do, little bit.

627
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,860
Little bit they do, I don't know about this one particular but they do.

628
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,020
How goes with Phil? What about him?

629
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,780
It's very nice, you see. According to him there are hundred and eight,

630
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,020
and so many can come in the camp, you see.

631
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,900
So there is a camping ground or they'l give us some,

632
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,020
what will they give for the camping?

633
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,060
Pardon?

634
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,700
There will be some tents?

635
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,780
Another statement is, Mother, is that thirty-five eighty-two

636
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,940
does include the camping ground, if we place our own tents.

637
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,820
Means?

638
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,340
Or, they will hire tents to us.

639
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,100
Oh, I see.

640
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,780
Those who want to sleep in the tents.

641
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,580
That's good.

642
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,380
and there will be accommodation for sixty to seventy people in rooms.

643
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,500
[Only those people who could find place

644
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,140
because they are really happy to have You staying with them].

645
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,700
All right. And what about hundred eight you have said?

646
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,660
So, we have the people in rooms, then there are some outbuildings,

647
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,940
being quite [unfurnished]

648
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,220
but we can sleep on floor if we have sleeping beds,

649
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,140
then, in this [courtyard], is the camping ground, the camping area.

650
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:16,540
And they will lend us the, we, we can pay for the hire of the tents.

651
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,580
It's still o.k.

652
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:24,420
And food they will give for all of us, whatever is the number.

653
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,700
Food... If we have a lot of children for instance,

654
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,460
they will do separate service for children,

655
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,580
then children will have food before the others.

656
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,820
Ah, very good Mother that sounds.

657
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,220
Sounds like it was made for us, Mother.

658
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:47,100
I mean you are going to go in the children side or what?

659
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,700
All right. And then?

660
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,580
The best thing, Mother, is that when I phoned they said,

661
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,580
"We are having an open day tomorrow".

662
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,140
They haven't got an open day for years.

663
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,540
That's the play.

664
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,060
Also, you see, ask them if they will give food to all of us, together,

665
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,980
if we pay them the same amount.

666
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,420
My impression Mother was that this would be possible,

667
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,140
though I suggested that we might cook one or two of our own meals,

668
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,820
perhaps after the Puja.

669
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,860
No, no, better, better let them do it.

670
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,220
Because you see, why to waste your energy in cooking?

671
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,540
O.k., we could do that.

672
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,620
And moreover you see, tell them that we can pay fourteen to you

673
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,900
but you give us tents and everything

674
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,860
and we all can pay you fourteen, whatever you say.

675
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,940
I'll do it.

676
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,300
It's remarcable.

677
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,540
It's a miracle to have this place. It comes to us,

678
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,980
just like this, Mother.

679
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,460
Yes, I told you that look out for something.

680
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,700
And that is in Kent or Sussex?

681
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:05,020
It's in Sussex, Mother. It is in, it's in nature somewhere.

682
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,220
Yes, I got it. Where is it Paul?

683
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,140
You see, you know your [unclear name] husband,

684
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,460
is a, is a nephew of the Duke of Sussex.

685
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,260
You know that?

686
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,700
Mother, pardon?

687
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,340
Your brother in law.

688
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,020
But that's true Mother, yes.

689
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,700
We had him for a dinner in Geneva.

690
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,940
Mother I think, he's very positive.

691
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,860
I don't know, [he seems] quite positive.

692
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,580
Is he?

693
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,380
Always.

694
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,220
Always quiet.

695
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,740
He's very much impressed that she has, you see,

696
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,460
that Mahila has married an English man.

697
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,460
He's very happy. But I tought that's the only solution

698
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,740
by which he can be brought to Sahaja Yoga.

699
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,500
Because he was very adamant, very adamanat to begin with.

700
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,900
Also, so Mother, he's visited India. He went to a visit in India

701
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,740
and he was visiting villages just around Pune,

702
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,060
and sitting on those grounds, isn't it, eating and [unclear],

703
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,460
that changed him a lot.

704
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,500
That changed him?

705
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,700
Yes, a lot.

706
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,380
Good. That's a good thing.

707
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,380
And where is the map?

708
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,660
Where is the place, Paul?

709
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,860
What's the name of the place?

710
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,380
Name of the place?

711
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,620
I thought it would be better, Mother, if it will be in Pulborough,

712
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,780
an outdoor, if it will be in the countryside.

713
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,620
No, no, it will be near Pulborough.

714
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,100
Near [Codmore]?

715
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,420
Oh, no, it's a...

716
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,060
You have been there, anyone?

717
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,700
Quite some, quite some old time, Mother.

718
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,060
Time [helps], it's a, it's a first day.

719
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,660
It is quiet there.

720
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,780
Here's one of the most important talk of the day,

721
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,660
really going to this place. Let's try to.

722
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,300
[It could be too windy] for Watersfield.

723
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,340
Most Australians [are waiting].

724
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,860
And cold water because of...

725
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,180
Yeah,

726
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:27,060
Place is called Watersfield, residential center.

727
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,100
Yeah, it's in the map.

728
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,860
Have a look it's in this...

729
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,540
It's in this area here, we are going there somewhere.

730
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,460
And where are we?

731
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,860
And we are here.

732
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,700
And there, that's London.

733
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:55,100
It's London, it's here. This is the motorway here.

734
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,940
And the motorway to this place?

735
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,380
All the way to these places, that takes you along the coast.

736
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,340
And along into the country.

737
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,940
Yes. It is here, you say? Here?

738
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,500
It's in this area, here.

739
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,020
Phil doesn't know exactly where it is,

740
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,299
so today [we are going to do] something.

741
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,780
So this is the way to London also.

742
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,660
It's all very, very easy to get to. This is it.

743
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,140
So it is nearer than Brighton, from London?

744
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,740
Oh, yes, yes. It's about nearly [fourty km distance].

745
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,340
Twenty minutes, Mother.

746
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,060
Ah, it is nearer, you see?

747
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,300
It's higher, here, and this road goes like that, you see?

748
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,140
And this goes to London there.

749
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,780
And another road comes this way, so it's London all.

750
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,380
Hmm, that's easier.

751
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,420
Cause London is there.

752
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,660
This is the [Crookhill] road beacause this has got the [unclear].

753
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,220
I don't know these [minor] roads here.

754
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,820
What do you mean? What road is this? Is this [Waterloo Road]?

755
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,940
No, no, no, that's a, that's very [minor] roads.

756
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,980
That's a country roads.

757
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,940
That's the, mid road here, is Mid Sussex road.

758
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,420
This road goes all the way to the Sussex. And goes up to Salisbury.

759
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,940
And [further] down there.

760
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,740
It would be very easy to get to the camp.

761
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,380
It's a, and there's a train station near going to...

762
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,820
What train station is?

763
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,180
I don't know, but there is sign there.

764
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,380
Little, little [line with] golden edges.

765
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,140
And place is in there, is in there because here is Petworth

766
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,820
and it's a big park in Petworth with...

767
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,060
Beautiful there.

768
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,540
It's very good park, it's a big old house,

769
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,660
and they have an enormous landscape park

770
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,500
with a lot of animals running about there.

771
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,740
And also with a lake, and as well as a lot to visit there.

772
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,940
But this is another [unclear]?

773
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,780
That's Petworth, it's a beautiful place with a park.

774
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,340
But people don't train people there?

775
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,220
So, they don't give it for conferences and things?

776
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,180
No, no, it's a Trust here. It's a national Trust.

777
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,460
This one. Now, we'll be here, say about this part.

778
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,299
Yes, we'll be here.

779
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:18,260
That's Pulborough, that's a railway name, stop of the train.

780
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,900
So we should easy get to.

781
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,260
If we have to go to London, what is this place is here?

782
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,060
That's Guildford. That's...

783
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,260
That's on the other side.

784
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,660
Yes. And then, this is a motorway here

785
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,660
that comes from the west country. And...

786
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,300
But it's very to get to.

787
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,660
I regularly go from here through this area to park, on that way.

788
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,820
That side we'll go.

789
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,580
Would, would You like to...

790
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,700
This is straight forward.

791
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,660
Yes, it's straight. Would You like to see the place tomorrow, next day?

792
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,900
Let's see. It's better let them go and fix it up first of all, all right?

793
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,820
We can take this road, you mean to say, straight, to London?

794
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,580
Yes, I think that's London road. London is over here.

795
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,860
This is a long way, but that is still longer, the motorway.

796
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,460
This is,  it's pretty large, it's the motorway,

797
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,580
to London and then this, very fast road, so here we come to Brighton.

798
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,220
This is quite a nice road too.

799
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,660
Oh yes, it's way to London.

800
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,100
We can go to London like that.

801
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,100
Isn't it?

802
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,220
Yes, this is a lovely part of the country.

803
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,340
When Joan and I got married, we stayed in Petworth, in hotel,

804
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,540
for the honeymoon and holiday.

805
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,460
What about this place? What is this?

806
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,900
That's Crawley. There's been meetings as well.

807
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,780
Crawley, aha. I know Crawley.

808
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,900
Crawley, you had some meetings? So how is it?

809
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,420
Crawley was. We had some meetings Mother, for a while.

810
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,500
We had meetings for about six moths Mother and many people came

811
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,580
and at the end of six months there was one person established.

812
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,500
Really?

813
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,299
Yes.

814
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,660
One.

815
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,940
Really, one person?

816
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,980
One, she is, if we can call her that way.

817
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,740
Really terrible. What's the problem? You got [down]?

818
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,380
Spiritualism, Mother.

819
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,060
What?

820
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,380
Spiritualism.

821
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,660
You know, spiritualism is about the worst [tally] in Crawley,

822
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,140
in England, before drugs.

823
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,580
For Crawley?

824
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,980
It's very lethargic. It's very lethargic place because everybody,

825
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,980
thigs they do [take them] to the left, you know,

826
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,940
they [don't care a straw],

827
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,540
watch emotional television, and they take a lot of drugs,

828
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,460
and they go into the pubs and that's about it.

829
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,060
It's a very dull, uninteresting town.

830
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,900
That's a spoilt place.

831
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,300
And even though so many Indians are there who called Me twice?

832
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,620
Indians are doing very well there.

833
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,860
They called You, Mother?

834
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,700
Ha, I was there twice for their Navaratri thing.

835
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,940
They actually, that day it has worked

836
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:16,299
but we couldn't stay in touch with them.

837
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,580
The Indians are, it's very little response from them.

838
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,740
And we are going to get in touch with them again.

839
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,220
I think Peter will try to [unclear] to Covington.

840
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,380
What did they say?

841
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,420
They have never tried, Mother.

842
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,820
They called Me twice.

843
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,420
Since they are only interested in Me that's the trouble is.

844
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,980
They want to call Me, they want Me to attend everytime,

845
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:44,420
but they don't want to do themselves anything.

846
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,100
As if for them I am like a king sitting there,

847
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,860
I should do nothing instead festivals,

848
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,580
things, bless all of them and finished.

849
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,060
This is typical Indian idea.

850
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,380
In England.

851
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,140
It's typical European idea, actually.

852
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,180
Many, many Christians have that aproach to God, Mother.

853
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,900
It's something they switch on, on Sunday, like a television.

854
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,180
They switch it off on Monday for a week and then forget about it.

855
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,460
It's like that only, stupid people get in.

856
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,100
Now, they have invited us to the Sindhu center, you see,

857
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,660
because they are having sort of a Havan and all that

858
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,660
and they think Shri Mataji must come and place the occasion and all that.

859
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,060
Finished.Then what?

860
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:34,340
Then if they have a problem then they must come and see Me, and now

861
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,740
on the second you see, three, four ladies from the High Commissioner,

862
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,980
are going to come and see Me. Deputy High Commissioner [strives] a lot.

863
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,740
So if they have any problem, they must come and tell Me,

864
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,540
this is the problem, that solve our problem, or there is sickness,

865
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,380
or anything, the child is like this, everything.

866
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,700
But they are not going to get [to ascent],

867
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,060
they are not going to get to anything,

868
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,900
they are not going to become anything.

869
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,860
It's only I am there so I will look after them,

870
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,540
"we'll leave it to Mother, things to do,

871
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,940
see I've got Your photograph, we do Puja,this, that".

872
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,540
I said, "What about you getting into it?"

873
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,700
That's the Indian style. And what to do?

874
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,340
I just can't talk to them, you know.

875
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,340
Same with these Crawley people.

876
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,900
See, they wrote about Me  in the newspaper, do you know,

877
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,980
in the Times or something it had appeared?

878
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:24,020
They wrote that She came, She cured us, we had great, great time there,

879
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,780
All these things they wrote.

880
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,220
But then also they don't want to go a little further.

881
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,100
Ask her. That day she was there for that Crawley meeting?

882
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,980
Yeah, [really] wonderful but...

883
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,660
Gavin was there.

884
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,340
Thousands.

885
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,820
They listened to Me about Sahaja Yoga, this, that.

886
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,580
They are so fanatic Indians,

887
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,380
I've decided I'll never go to their Puja absolutely.

888
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:50,860
Cut out.

889
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,940
All fell, touched My feet, everything they did.

890
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,300
But nobody is interested in Sahaja Yoga, in Realization.

891
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,700
Can you imagine such a thing?

892
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,660
They are so materialistic, you have no idea.

893
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,940
They are worse than you people.

894
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,180
They have come here to earn money,

895
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,100
they think that if there is a saint here,

896
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,940
a saint's, you see, blessings can give them more money, that's all.

897
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,500
That's their idea.

898
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:28,700
So, it's like all the gutters, you see, have been brought here like

899
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,380
[rock of Gibraltar]. Ask [Jyoti], she will tell you.

900
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,100
How can we change all their traditions, everything, I can't understand.

901
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:39,460
They have become so horrid.

902
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,340
And they have no esthetics nothing. Horrible.

903
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,460
So much money oriented.

904
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,380
Can't save them.

905
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,900
For a while it's all right. But all the time, all the time, they want

906
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,500
some sort of a money and eating thing like.

907
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,100
I call them export and import.

908
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,580
No higher things, nothing in their lives.

909
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,180
That's why, you see, if you see Indians in India,

910
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,860
if you see them you'll be shocked.

911
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,700
The difference is so much.

912
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,500
It's all there in India, all there.

913
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,020
So when he told Me he's married an Indian I was rather worried, you see,

914
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,940
that now, a Gujrathi Indian.

915
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,580
But [Jyoti] is remarcable, remarcable.

916
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:45,060
She's not at all and she is still [Indian].

917
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,260
How can you to something so much, to such an extent?

918
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,700
I mean I just can't understand.

919
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,620
Such a abusiveness.

920
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,180
And look at that girl how she was rude.

921
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,780
I mean Indians are normally never rude, you see.

922
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,380
That's not done, it's not...

923
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,860
To an elder also, leave alone a person like Me,

924
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,340
but to an elder also they don't talk like that.

925
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,780
You see... How old you are about?

926
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,940
All right.

927
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,220
That's the fact.

928
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,780
The other day they are going to have this Puja in the Hindu center.

929
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:25,620
Let's see. They want Me to talk on Sahaja Yoga.

930
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,220
In London, Mother? In London?

931
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,620
In London.

932
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:34,260
It's Shri Mataji coming. It's Shri Mataji. Very nice.

933
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,220
So it's Shri Mataji has to look after their children,

934
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,460
look after everyone, look after our dogs, look after our things,

935
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,260
purses, look after our buffalos in India.

936
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,820
All right.
