1
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,834
[NO SOUND UP TO HERE]

2
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:30,625
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,166
I asked them to play this music,

4
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:48,375
because the thoughts were too much

5
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:51,375
[in the minds?]

6
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,792
And this music has no words,

7
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,250
it doesn't give you thoughts.

8
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:12,375
And that's how thoughts can be removed very easily.

9
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:23,542
One thought rises and falls off.

10
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,875
Another thought rises and falls off.

11
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:33,417
And we are jumping on the cusp of the thought.

12
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,999
Either we are thinking about the past or about the future.

13
00:39:55,417 --> 00:40:00,000
But we cannot be in the present.

14
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:09,417
When one thought rises and falls off,

15
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,208
and before another rises,

16
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:16,208
there is a space in between and that is the present.

17
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,667
So when this Kundalini rises,

18
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:34,709
it makes this thought smaller.

19
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:46,291
And this central area of silence expands.

20
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:56,875
That is the time we become thoughtlessly aware.

21
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,917
When we look at a beautiful carpet,

22
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,917
all kinds of thoughts start coming in our head.

23
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,667
If this is my carpet, then I am worried about the insurance.

24
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:28,208
But if it is somebody else's carpet,

25
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:32,000
then I start thinking, where will I get such a beautiful carpet,

26
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,625
how much I'll have to pay?

27
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:48,625
I cannot enjoy the creation of beauty and joy,

28
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:53,208
that the artist has tried to pour into it.

29
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:03,375
So when I see this carpet,

30
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:06,625
and I am in thoughtless awareness,

31
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:13,041
all the joy of it's creation starts flowing, like a river Ganges,

32
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,250
cool vibrations start flowing and you feel completely relaxed.

33
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:37,166
So the first step we have to do in Sahaja Yoga,

34
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:41,458
is to establish our thoughtless awareness.

35
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:55,834
It can be done, if we understand this center of Agnya.

36
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:05,291
It is placed between the two optic chasms crossing,

37
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,750
like this.

38
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:17,583
And when the Kundalini pierces through it,

39
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:22,834
the Deity in that center is awakened.

40
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:37,999
This is the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ.

41
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:50,625
First he is conceptualized by the Divine,

42
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,208
in the first Chakra of Mooladhara.

43
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:05,041
So he is the Deity of innocence,

44
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:11,125
which incarnates on this earth.

45
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:19,041
Not only this, but it is the body of Christ

46
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,291
was made of vibrations.

47
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:32,083
That is why he could walk on the water.

48
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:38,291
He has told a very simple thing,

49
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,875
that we have to forgive others,

50
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:46,333
as God has to forgive us.

51
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,125
As soon as you forgive others,

52
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,417
and ask for forgiveness,

53
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,375
this center opens.

54
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:13,500
And then Christ is awakened,

55
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,542
is born within you, or can say awakened,

56
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,583
and he sucks in these two institutions

57
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:24,417
of ego and your conditioning, which is called as superego.

58
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,291
So these two institutions are sucked in

59
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,834
and the brain opens out like a lotus.

60
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,999
Inside is the limbic area.

61
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:09,625
And the Kundalini then passes through your fontanel-bone-area.

62
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:17,750
But the most important thing is,

63
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,625
first this center has to be completely opened out.

64
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,792
Then the question one gentleman has asked,

65
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:35,166
that are the sufferings due to our Kharmas?

66
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,125
Only the human beings think, that they are doing some Kharmas.

67
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:52,083
Animals never think that way.

68
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:56,750
Because we have our ego,

69
00:46:56,959 --> 00:47:00,500
That's why we think, we have done wright or wrong.

70
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,667
A tiger will kill any animal and eat it.

71
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,999
A serpent can just bite anyone.

72
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,083
But they don't think they have done anything wrong or wright.

73
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,792
But human beings think,

74
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:41,667
that we have done this wrong and this wright.

75
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,750
But, actually, they do not know, what is wright and wrong.

76
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:58,083
Because they live in relative world.

77
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:04,792
For somebody this is wright, for somebody that is wright.

78
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:11,959
But what is the absolute?

79
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,333
What is the absolute truth?

80
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,333
That only you can know,

81
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:24,583
when you have these divine vibrations,

82
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:33,542
and you become the divine computer.

83
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,709
Then everybody, who has got this awareness,

84
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,458
thinks the same way.

85
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:52,083
They just know, what is wright and what is wrong.

86
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:59,250
Like, if there is a dirty lane,

87
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:04,250
a tiger, or a dog, all can pass through it.

88
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,750
But human beings can not pass.

89
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,625
They will all get the same dirty smell,

90
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:21,750
and they won't be able to go through that dirt.

91
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:30,166
But when you become a saint,

92
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:36,792
then you know, what is wright and what is wrong.

93
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:45,208
And you cannot do anything that is wrong.

94
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,834
Because you get this new dimension,

95
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,166
by which you know, that this we cannot have, this is wrong.

96
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,667
But before that, before that fully happens,

97
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:11,000
you have your conditionings and your ego.

98
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:21,291
That covers you and you become a closed personality,

99
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,375
like an egg.

100
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:31,542
So the opening of this

101
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:36,875
has to be done by the awakening of the Kundalini,

102
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:41,500
but also at this center, Agnya-center,

103
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:44,250
when Christ is awakened,

104
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,667
he sucks in your ego, your Kharmas,

105
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,709
and he sucks in your conditionings.

106
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,041
That's what he said, that we say,

107
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,417
that Christ died for our sins.

108
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:14,709
That's what we say, that Christ died for our sins.

109
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,333
Because when he is awakened,

110
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:27,291
by his own powers he can suck in all our sins.

111
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,667
So you don't have to go on [harping?],

112
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:40,542
that I have done bad Kharmas, I have done bad Kharmas.

113
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,625
You need not feel guilty at all.

114
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:58,875
because Christ has done this duty for us, of resurrection,

115
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:04,166
and because of him all our Kharmas are going to be sucked in.

116
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,917
He has suffered for us.

117
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:18,625
So we don't have to suffer any more.

118
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:24,792
This idea of suffering has come from people,

119
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,625
who just like people to suffer.

120
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:38,959
They want you not to enjoy the beauty of Gods love.

121
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,375
They will say, you are sinners,

122
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,208
so you must pay money,

123
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:53,917
and when you pay money, all your sins will be finished.

124
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,625
But God does not understand money.

125
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,750
He doesn't know banking.

126
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,625
It's all your headache.

127
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:20,375
So all such ideas are given, that we must suffer,

128
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:23,375
and we should starve, we should stand on our heads,

129
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,750
and we should give all the money to these people,

130
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:29,458
who are telling us, we are sinners.

131
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:42,333
Are we going to suffer more, then what Christ has suffered?

132
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:51,834
In Sistine-Chapel I saw Michelangelo has made

133
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:56,792
such a huge beautiful Sistine-Chapel,

134
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:01,250
with a Christ with such a healthy body standing there.

135
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:10,959
Because Michelangelo was a realized soul.

136
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,417
And below that was a table,

137
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,750
on which something, called Christ, was kept,

138
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:24,542
with bones and skin on top.

139
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,125
So miserable, like a tuberculoses-patient.

140
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:41,458
Can a patient like that carry a big cross?

141
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:47,208
Think about it!

142
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:55,291
Now, thank God, Thomas, the disciple of Christ,

143
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,375
has written all about Christ,

144
00:54:57,583 --> 00:55:02,166
and it was stored in Egypt, on his way to India.

145
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:07,291
Thomas has written everything about Christ,

146
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,625
and has stored it in Egypt.

147
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,417
And it has been [decoded?]

148
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,291
and after forty-eight years

149
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,750
we have come to know,

150
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:29,375
that Thomas has talked about nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

151
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:44,041
He says, that our father, God,

152
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,458
is the father of all the fathers.

153
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:51,834
And he is so kind,

154
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,917
he is so loving,

155
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:58,625
how can he ask you to suffer for him?

156
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,125
He has said, that you have to have the experience of self-knowledge,

157
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,166
and then you will realize,

158
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:21,000
that our father is just anxiously waiting us,

159
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:24,959
for us to enter into the kingdom of God.

160
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,875
Now, you see, that he has said it,

161
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:36,083
that our father is waiting in the kingdom of God for us,

162
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,166
to enter into it.

163
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,709
So let us be joyous and happy.

164
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:58,000
And give up the idea of sufferings.

165
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:05,625
We have to have the self knowledge, that's all.

166
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:12,417
You are not to feel sad or guilty.

167
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:21,291
This is what is the message of Thomas about Christ.

168
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,542
So thinking creates,

169
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,917
as he, the gentleman, has asked me about diabetes,

170
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:35,041
that can it be cured of thirty years of diabetes?

171
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:37,875
It can be very easily.

172
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:49,542
The diabetes is caused by over-thinking.

173
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:54,999
Because the second center that we have,

174
00:57:55,166 --> 00:58:00,625
the yellow one, which moves round the green void,

175
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,750
is the one by which, ah ...

176
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:10,291
When we think, the grey cells are transformed into ...

177
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,375
When we use our grey cells,

178
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:19,417
we get more grey celles, by the activity of this particular center,

179
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,709
called as Swadisthana.

180
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:38,583
So it converts the fat-celles into the grey cells,

181
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:42,417
for the use of the brain, when we think too much.

182
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:52,458
Now, if you think too much,

183
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:56,041
then this poor center has to do only one job,

184
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,999
is to convert the fat-celles

185
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:02,834
into the grey cells for the brain.

186
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:13,667
But it has many other things to be done.

187
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:19,417
And it has to look after the liver.

188
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,792
It has to look after the pancreas.

189
00:59:21,999 --> 00:59:23,875
It has to look after the spleen.

190
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:26,125
It has to look after the intestines.

191
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:29,625
And also it has to look after the kidney.

192
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,750
But when you think too much,

193
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:45,000
all these organs are neglected.

194
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,834
Now in India, in the villages,

195
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,542
when they take sugar,

196
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,667
the villagers must have the spoon standing at right angel

197
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,999
in the sugar ...

198
01:00:05,999 --> 01:00:07,875
... in the cup.

199
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:12,792
Now, they drink so much of sugar, nobody gets diabetes.

200
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,166
Because they don't think.

201
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:27,125
They earn, they earn for one day,

202
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,875
and sleep off nicely,

203
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:32,417
they don't have to take sleeping-pills.

204
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:40,750
But it is very difficult to stop thinking,

205
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:43,458
once your brain is modern.

206
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,458
Like one doctor in Switzerland said,

207
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:52,959
Mother you cut my throught, or do what you like,

208
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,375
but stop this thinking.

209
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:09,875
So this thinking itself is responsible for diabetes.

210
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,458
And the gentleman who has diabetes,

211
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,041
if he practises Sahaja Yoga,

212
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:19,208
his thinking will be under his control.

213
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,375
If he wants to think, he can think.

214
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:35,333
Or if he doesn't want to think, he need not think.

215
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:43,917
Even when too many thoughts are bombarding you,

216
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:49,125
if he just say, I forgive, I forgive, I forgive, three times,

217
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:54,709
you will find that this center will be quite at ease,

218
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:57,667
and you won't have problems.

219
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:11,709
Yesterday you saw, so many people did not feel the cool breeze.

220
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:14,667
and when I said, now forgive, forgive, forgive, three times,

221
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:17,417
they started feeling the vibrations.

222
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,834
And one lady said, she cannot forgive,

223
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,750
it is very difficult, she cannot forgive.

224
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,458
Because of that her, this center had become so [jumped?],

225
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:48,125
because it could not get out anything from here.

226
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:59,709
So, as you saw, yesterday I gave two jets to her Vishuddhi,

227
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:04,083
and she started feeling the vibrations all right.

228
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,834
Two jets I gave her.

229
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,458
So in the modern times, I think, there are two centers,

230
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:24,875
which are very much blocked.

231
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:33,166
One of them is this Chakra of Vishuddhi.

232
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,000
And another is of Agnya.

233
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:45,625
And this Vishuddhi Chakra is for collectivity.

234
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:50,959
Is for communication.

235
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,250
For example, when we have to wish somebody,

236
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,750
we shake the hands.

237
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,792
Because of my another life, with my husband,

238
01:04:04,999 --> 01:04:09,583
sometimes I have to shake hands, with 700 people at a time.

239
01:04:18,041 --> 01:04:19,542
Only when they are going in,

240
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,792
but when they are coming out, they are drunk.

241
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:23,875
So you don't know, what they do to your hand,

242
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,625
completely finish it off.

243
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:39,999
So this hand, which God has given us,

244
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,208
gives you communication.

245
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:49,750
And also gives, tells you, there is communication with the divine.

246
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:54,041
because you start feeling the cool breeze, on your fingertips.

247
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,709
Now, the doctors have agreed,

248
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:08,999
that these are the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system.

249
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,792
And so we have five, six and seven centers

250
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,875
on the left-hand side and seven centers on the right-hand side.

251
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:34,250
Now when left and right side meet, a center is formed like this.

252
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:42,750
And inside is the part of our ascent,

253
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:45,083
is a third channel.

254
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:54,291
So this is the left sympathetic, this is the right sympathetic.

255
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,750
When ever we use in emergency,

256
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:04,208
these two sympathetics, what happens sometimes, they go like that.

257
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:13,625
And sometimes, with some sort of a shock, it breaks.

258
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:19,792
Then the relation with the whole is lost.

259
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:25,625
And the cells start growing on their own,

260
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:29,542
we call it, it is then a malignancy, cancer.

261
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,208
So to cure the cancer, if the Kundalini rises,

262
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:43,041
what you have to do, is to push this like that.

263
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,250
Yesterday there was a lady with cancer,

264
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:55,500
and also with multiple sclerosis.

265
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,208
So what I did, I put a candle before me,

266
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:06,959
and asked he, to put her left hand towards the candle.

267
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:17,291
Now, by putting left hand to the candle,

268
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,375
you see, my vibrations were passing

269
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,667
through this light, which was enlightened

270
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:26,625
and was passing through the hand, from the left side,

271
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:32,917
and by that this one, that was broken, got fitted like that.

272
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:44,208
And within ten minutes the [bold?] felt all right.

273
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:50,041
There is no miracle, it is scientific.

274
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,875
Absolutely scientific.

275
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,417
Only, science can go up to a point.

276
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:04,875
Whatever they see is the science.

277
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,333
They cannot go beyond.

278
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,583
So they use only human awareness.

279
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:21,500
But if you use your superhuman awareness,

280
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:23,792
you have all the knowledge.

281
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,375
And if you work it out,

282
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:34,542
if you work it out, you will be amazed,

283
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:41,417
how one candle can cure ten cancer patients.

284
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:51,709
Then they say, Mother we should give you some money.

285
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:55,667
How much will you pay for a candle?

286
01:09:02,417 --> 01:09:04,417
How can you pay for that?

287
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:09,625
So this is how it is so simple.

288
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:14,834
When you go to the basics and the fundamentals,

289
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,125
everything is very simple.

290
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:28,125
Now, I must say, Sahaja Yoga has also cured Aids.

291
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,792
But those people who get Aids,

292
01:09:33,999 --> 01:09:36,417
have no will-power to live.

293
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:46,250
Those people whom we cured, again went to the dirty habits.

294
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:54,750
So they again got it.

295
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,333
Like this, there are many diseases, which can be easily cured,

296
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:07,875
if you know, from which side the problem is coming.

297
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,083
Is it coming from the left, or from the right?

298
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:21,875
If somebody says, how many turns there are?

299
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:25,750
Only left and right, that's all. Two turns.

300
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:35,500
So if you can cure your left, or right,

301
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,750
you are in the center.

302
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:46,500
That is why Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method

303
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:51,291
of curing many diseases, which are incurable.

304
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:01,917
The left side diseases that comes to us

305
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:06,125
can be called as psychic, and the right side somatic.

306
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,625
So the combination of these two

307
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:18,250
also there are diseases which are psycho-somatic,

308
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:20,625
they also can be cured.

309
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:31,875
So even in this modern times, where we really do crazy things,

310
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:36,792
it doesn't matter, you can be balanced and you can be all right.

311
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,583
In Sahaja Yoga you feel so satisfied, so happy,

312
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:52,250
all the time so joyous, and so generous,

313
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:56,834
that you do not feel the greed,

314
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:59,500
the bangs of the greed.

315
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,999
In that you want to give.

316
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:16,250
Like this light, which is first not enlightened,

317
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,542
must be waiting for the light, to come inside it.

318
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,208
When this light is not enlightened,

319
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:29,000
then it is waiting for the, to be enlightened.

320
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:38,291
But once it is enlightened, it is giving light.

321
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:45,625
So once you are asking for light, you are sitting like this,

322
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:49,542
and once you get the light, you give lights to others.

323
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,583
Thus you start clearefying yourself completely,

324
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,709
the purity starts coming within you.

325
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:07,083
Your eyes become innocent.

326
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:11,250
Your heart becomes pure.

327
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,208
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy them.

328
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:20,667
And you enjoy others.

329
01:13:21,834 --> 01:13:25,709
Those who have got realization, you enjoy their company.

330
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:32,583
You enjoy your marriages, you enjoy your children,

331
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:35,458
you enjoy your family.

332
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:43,583
You enjoy your friends, you enjoy Sahaja Yogis,

333
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:45,333
everyone you enjoy.

334
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:50,250
There is no jealousy, there is no competition, nothing of that kind.

335
01:13:56,917 --> 01:14:01,583
Such friendship, that I tell you, is so joy giving.

336
01:14:01,999 --> 01:14:04,333
When I see a jew,

337
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:10,792
holding a muslim Sahaja Yogi with such joy,

338
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:13,917
embracing fully.

339
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:29,041
All these barriers, which are so false, drop out.

340
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:38,166
That is how one race of higher-awareness people comes up.

341
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,875
and this transformation

342
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:43,542
makes them forget all these nonsensical things.

343
01:14:51,792 --> 01:14:55,959
We have to all become the spirit,

344
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:02,333
which is the reflection of God Almighty,

345
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:10,750
which is the source of peace and joy.

346
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,417
Is the source of all the knowledge, which is pure knowledge.

347
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:26,999
And when the light of the spirit comes in your attention,

348
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:30,709
your attention becomes pure.

349
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:42,417
There is no lust and greed, but pure love.

350
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:53,166
If such a person even puts a glance towards you,

351
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,875
then you feel the peace,

352
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,291
you can feel the Kundalini rising,

353
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,875
you can get completely cured.

354
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:15,709
And about all, spiritually we become one

355
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:19,542
with that great ocean of divine power.

356
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:29,542
And from very small incitents to very big incitents

357
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:34,959
you will be amazed, that you feel, all the time, there is protection

358
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:47,250
and complete guidance and help every moment.

359
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:52,792
First you think it is coincidence,

360
01:16:52,999 --> 01:16:55,041
but later on every moment,

361
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,417
when you find there is something is happening to help you,

362
01:16:58,625 --> 01:17:01,083
then you'll understand, that it is something.

363
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,000
We are in the kingdom of God.

364
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:19,166
Everyone of you have right to enter into the kingdom of God.

365
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:26,542
So please don't feel guilty.

366
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:31,959
And forgive everyone. That's all.

367
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,667
And you'll be surprised, how suddenly you will find yourself

368
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:43,041
into that state of thoughtless awareness.

369
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:52,834
And than, after some time,

370
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,999
you'll become doubtlessly aware.

371
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:04,250
You have no doubts about yourself, that you are a realized soul,

372
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:09,041
and you have no doubts about others, that they are realized souls.

373
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,542
You have complete confidence about it.

374
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:26,458
It is such a powerful, dynamic compassion.

375
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:35,291
So let us have our realization now.

376
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,917
It will take about ten minutes

377
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:47,417
and I am sure all of you will be helped very much.

378
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:57,917
If you all put your shoes on one side

379
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:02,458
and put both feet on the ground, separated.

380
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,667
Those who want to come, can come also in front, to sit down.

381
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:21,458
It's better the lady has gone there, ask her to sit here,

382
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:23,000
come, not on the sides.

383
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:26,250
You won't be able to see me. You come here?

384
01:19:32,959 --> 01:19:36,458
These are all Sahaja Yogis, it's all right.

385
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:40,000
Those who want to come can come and sit in front.

386
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:03,125
There is - come in, come in - there is space here.

387
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,875
Next time you must take a bigger hall.

388
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:26,125
Can you full this up there, so, it [would be?] better.

389
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:29,333
Can you pull this chair, my chair there?

390
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,166
This chair.
