1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,487
In life. In the same way, vibrations, vibrations are coming,

2
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:10,149
they are radiated.

3
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:13,226
What you have to do is to expose yourself to it.

4
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:16,175
The best way is not to put in any effort.

5
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:19,607
Don't worry at what point you have a problem.

6
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,161
Say, many people during meditation, I have seen,

7
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:24,986
if they catch somewhere they go on looking after it.

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,021
You just don't have to worry.

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,328
You just let it go

10
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,502
and it will work by itself.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,086
It's very easy.

12
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:52,577
OK. So you don't have to put in any effort.

13
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:54,653
This is what meditation is.

14
00:00:54,738 --> 00:01:00,060
Meditation means exposing yourself to God's grace.

15
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,713
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

16
00:01:04,035 --> 00:01:06,266
It knows how to mend you,

17
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,438
how to settle down itself

18
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:11,992
to your own being, how to keep your Spirit kindled.

19
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,460
It knows everything.

20
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,644
So you don't have to worry as to

21
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:21,462
what you have to do

22
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,789
or what name you have to take

23
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,328
what mantras you have to do.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,428
In meditation you have to do absolutely effortless,

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,364
expose yourself fully

26
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:39,311
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless at that time.

27
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,519
Supposing, possibly, you might not be thoughtless.

28
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:46,624
At that time you have to just watch your thoughts, but

29
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:48,663
don't get involved into them.

30
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,944
You will find gradually as the sun rises,

31
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,369
darkness goes away

32
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:58,988
and the sun's rays go into every [?] and every part

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,869
and makes the whole place enlightened.

34
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:06,724
In the same way your being/kundalini will be completely enlightened

35
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:09,426
but if you put in an effort at that time

36
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:11,553
or try to stop something within you

37
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,013
or try to give it a bandhan it will not.

38
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:18,338
Effortlessness is the only way into meditation,

39
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,972
but you should not be lethargic about it -

40
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,816
should be alert and watch it.

41
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,854
The other side could be that people just dose off. No,

42
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,819
you have to be alert.

43
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,845
If you dose off, nothing will work out.

44
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:35,522
That's another side of it is.

45
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,821
If you are lazy about it, nothing will work out.

46
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:43,489
You have to be alert and open,

47
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:46,211
absolutely aware,

48
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,956
completely effortless,

49
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,578
absolutely effortless.

50
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:55,176
If you are absolutely effortless,

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,305
meditation will work the best.

52
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,228
Don't think of your problems at all,

53
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,306
whatever charkas you have,

54
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,328
anything,

55
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,249
just expose yourself

56
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,487
See when the sun shines

57
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:11,309
all the nature exposes itself to the sun

58
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:15,120
and this is the blessings of the sun, effortlessly,

59
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,971
you doesn't put any effort,

60
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:19,221
it just receives itself -

61
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,033
when it receives the sun's rays and the sun's rays start

62
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:26,492
acting an activity.

63
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:34,392
In the same way the all-pervading power

64
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,347
starts working.

65
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,046
You are not to maneuver it,

66
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,808
you are not to do anything about it. Just be effortless,

67
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,312
absolutely effortless.

68
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,381
Don't take any names.

69
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,756
Do not bother if your Agnya is catching,

70
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,345
this is catching, that is catching.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,076
It is working out.

72
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:56,935
It will go on working

73
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,630
as long as it can

74
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:05,122
and it will do the miracle that it has to do.

75
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,991
You don't have to worry about it. It knows its job.

76
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,316
But when you put in an effort actually

77
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,698
you create a barrier for it.

78
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:16,165
So no effort is needed,

79
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:20,463
be absolutely effortless and say 'let it go, let it go' - that's all.

80
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,608
No mantras been chanted,

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,680
in case you find it's impossible, then you can take my name,

82
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,152
but there is no need even.

83
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:32,106
When you put your hand toward me that is the mantra, it is sufficient,

84
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,444
this gesture itself is mantra.

85
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,785
You see there is no need to say it more,

86
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:42,022
but the thought, I think, in the mind,

87
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,341
the emotion should be 
that we have to spread our hands to that

88
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,603
and it should work.

89
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:51,587
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

90
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:57,260
there is no need to say any, and you go beyond.

91
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:04,691
So one has to be absolutely effortless, absolutely effortless.

92
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,522
That is what it is.

93
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:19,351
Meditation is for your own ascent,

94
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:25,692
is for your own capital gains that you have to have.

95
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,749
But once you get into it,

96
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,875
you also achieve your powers.

97
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:34,134
Like if you become the governor, you get the powers of the governor.

98
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:38,829
At this time you don't have to think about anybody else.

99
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,250
You are not put your attention to anybody else

100
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,211
but just receive it, just receive it.

101
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,438
Do not think of any other problems,

102
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:56,022
but that you have to be effortless, absolutely effortless.

103
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:08,328
It would work best on the people who are just receiving it.

104
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,964
You have problems, that's why you are here,

105
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,719
but you cannot solve them,

106
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,866
they are to be solved by divine power.

107
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,147
[?]

108
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:20,209
This must be understood fully,

109
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:23,376
that we cannot solve our problems.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,601
It is beyond us

111
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:30,566
to solve our problems.

112
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,718
So leave it in the hands of the  divine power

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,991
and expose yourself effortlessly, absolutely effortlessly.

114
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:48,927
Sit in comfort, and properly with both the feet on the ground,

115
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:53,234
with both the hands relaxed like this.

116
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:56,789
Be comfortable, you should not be uncomfortable at all.

117
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,742
Be very comfortable because you will sit for quite some time.

118
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,840
And try to put your attention to me, within yourself,

119
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:12,113
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

120
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:16,090
You can come into my Kundalini and it will be done in no time.

121
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,400
Just like this, the hands should be like this [?]

122
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,663
So effortlessness is the key word,

123
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:31,848
absolutely effortlessly,

124
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:35,883
whether you are meditating before me, or before my photograph.
