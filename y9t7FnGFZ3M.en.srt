1
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Very happy to see all of you here. Now I can't
say that you are the seekers but you are the

2
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,070
ones who have found it.

3
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:52,070
It's something so fulfilling. Imagine in the
olden days the custom was, I mean, it was

4
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:09,050
so, that one guru could give realisation to
one person, with very great reluctance! First

5
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:20,959
they had to go through all kinds of tests,
all kinds of tapasya as they call it, very,

6
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,020
very strict penance. And out of that they
would select one person to get Self-realisation.

7
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:51,690
Imagine what you have got in such a short
time! But, with that long period of ordeal,

8
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,740
they developed a great sense of respecting
their Self-realisation, of understanding what

9
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,690
is this. Understanding their own powers, understanding
their own duties. And they were not so many.

10
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:42,180
One single person fighting the whole society
with his lofty ideas. While today you are

11
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,959
so many, all of you are in fraternity, in
love with each other. Nobody is going to torture

12
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:04,610
you, nobody is going to take you to task,
but you yourself will feel like spreading

13
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,630
Sahaja Yoga, giving love and life to people.
It will come spontaneously within you. Like

14
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:29,459
a flower which has fragrance, like that you'll
have the fragrance of spirituality and people

15
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,160
will suddenly recognise you because you are
so different from others.

16
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Your temperament is so different you are so
balanced you are so sweet and they will come

17
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,540
around, they will follow you. it has happened
very fast in some countries. Like in India

18
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,680
they know this, they know Self-realisation
and they know that is the aim of life, so

19
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:18,100
it was much easier, it has so many Sahaja
yogis.

20
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,100
But we have sahaja yogis all over the world
now, even in Greenland, can you imagine, in

21
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:36,829
Finland in Sweden, in Norway. We have Israelis
and also Palestinians. They are in Sahaja

22
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:52,250
Yoga. Supposed to be fighting but both of
them are in Sahaja Yogi. One Israeli telephoned

23
00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:01,709
to me that 'Mother, there are some Palestinian
sahaja yogis in a village and we have learnt

24
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,860
that it is going to be bombed. Can you put
your attention to that?' I was so touched.

25
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Look at the amount of care and love they have
for the so-called enemies! If this kind of

26
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:27,199
love grows one day all this wars and skirmishes
all will be finished, there won't be any fights

27
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,880
if you realise we are all one, just all, absolutely,
in one Divinity, in one Divine Power. If that

28
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,610
is built in, then all these problems will
be solved about which I told you in my lecture

29
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,110
(at Royal Albert Hall a few days before).

30
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:07,110
Actually Kundalini has risen in many of you,
most of you. It has pierced also the fontanelle

31
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:16,510
bone area, no doubt, but still it comes down
sometimes, comes down to cure you. Supposing

32
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,160
you are a liver patient, the Kundalini will
come down and put full attention to your liver

33
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
and try to improve your liver. She looks after
you. She is your individual Mother. Everyone

34
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:52,180
has that Mother within you. And that Mother
is the one that guides you, looks after you

35
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,100
and takes you to the right path. And that's
how you'll start your new growth in Sahaja

36
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:12,089
yoga. You become a different personality.Then
your attention starts moving away from you

37
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:25,409
to others. That's the sign you are fully grown.
If that happens that your attention doesn't

38
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:38,460
go to yourself, it goes to others and you
are worried about others.

39
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,620
It's very surprising, how this love of the
Divine works wonders. I had gone to Russia

40
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:57,210
first time, and I was surprised, twenty-five
people from Germany and Austria came there

41
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,480
on there own, I never called them, organised
their stay and everything. And I said 'Why

42
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,500
are you here? How are you here? How did you
come? What is the speciality of Russia?' And

43
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:28,620
they said, 'Mother, our forefathers had done
so much harm to them so we just couldn't help

44
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:38,889
it.' It's a kind of a tremendous love and
understanding about the problems of Russians

45
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:49,139
during war. And they were telling me what
all had happened to Russians. I was surprised.

46
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:58,889
I asked them 'Who told you?' 'Our father,
our grandfather, who were repenting what they

47
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:12,179
have done. But they are no more now so we
thought we had better come and do some service.'

48
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:21,820
It's very much touching to me. I have seen
such beautiful side of human beings after

49
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:33,550
they have got realisation. No cruelty of any
kind, no unkindness, always forgiveness, such

50
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,889
a lot of people have become now so sweet.

51
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:51,889
In Russia we have, as you know, maximum number
of sahaja yogis, not more than India, but

52
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,480
yes. So many of them are there in Russia,
and they are so deep, so much understanding.

53
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:13,540
They never grudge about their problems of
money or anything. They said 'Mother, we have

54
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,860
only one problem.' 'What problem you have?'
'Of leadership. Give us a nice leader. And

55
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,159
now,' they said 'we have a nice leader.' He
has accepted Sahaja Yoga, it's a religion

56
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,159
in Russia. Of course, it is also a religion
in India. But actually it is accepted as an

57
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:49,659
official religion in America. Just imagine!

58
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,950
We think that Americans are so materialistic
and this and that. They are only 200 year

59
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:09,370
old nation and how have they grown so deep
into spirituality, how did they realise this,

60
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,440
that, spirituality is the essence of life.

61
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Now I am facing you people who are supposed
to be from England and English had these great

62
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:44,960
people right from Shakespeare, William Blake,
all of them were realised souls. But what

63
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:53,830
I find in their effort is that they are trying
to show so many things for you to understand

64
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,850
Sahaja Yoga. But what can they do, because
they didn't know how to raise the Kundalini

65
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:18,320
perhaps, or the people were absolutely deaf
and dumb that they didn't understand what

66
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,440
these people tried to convey.

67
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Most of the poets were realised souls. Most
of the writers were realised souls. How can

68
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,940
it be that such great people are just lost?
But now when I see you all here I think of

69
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,800
them. They must be very happy to see you all
enjoying the bliss, the bliss of the Divine.

70
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:11,429
There's no end to the description of these
things. You cannot describe it fully. It is

71
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,909
to be enjoyed. Only thing is, first stage
is thoughtless awareness, which you have to

72
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:26,909
achieve. If you have achieved the thoughtless
awareness then you have crossed one step.

73
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:39,600
That is the main thing.

74
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,600
You have to become thoughtlessly aware. It's
not difficult. There's a sanskrit saying that

75
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,600
you start saying no to every thought. Whatever
thought comes in -- 'Ya neti neti wachane

76
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:11,280
nigamor awachus'. Just go on saying 'No. Not
this thought. Not this thought. Not this thought.'

77
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:18,629
And you can achieve it. Also raising Kundalini,
forgiving people, you can achieve it. Also

78
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,980
if you can find out why these thoughts are
coming to you, what is the source of this

79
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:41,370
thought. If you could just see what is the
source then you can do it. Suddenly you will

80
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:51,970
find you are silent, you are not thinking
but you are aware, fully aware and aware of

81
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,940
so many things of which you were never aware.
It's something you have to practice, is to

82
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,129
become thoughtlessly aware.

83
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:19,129
This awareness gives a new dimension to your
attention. You develop an attention that works,

84
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:30,290
that works. Sitting down here, if you want
to think about something, this attention will

85
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:42,770
go and work out the problem. It works out.
You can also do it. But if your attention

86
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:53,770
is on small, small things like 'My father
is like this..my sister-in-law is like this'

87
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,960
all this kind of things, you forget. And don't
condemn yourself either. If you condemn yourself

88
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:13,419
it's of no use because now you are a realised
soul. There is no need to condemn but just

89
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:24,159
to watch without thinking. That's what is
called as sakshi, is the witness state.

90
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:34,350
That witness state you have to attain and
once you attain that witness state you start

91
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:46,340
enjoying everything. Supposing somebody is
nasty, you can see the humour behind that.

92
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,590
Supposing somebody is aggressive, you can
just smile at it. You can see that, poor thing

93
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,850
you know, he's doing something wrong because
he can't help it, or she is mischievous, doesn't

94
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:20,380
matter, she'll be alright. An attitude of
an innocent personality. You are innocent

95
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:35,210
you don't see anything wrong with anyone.
If you are cunning you see everybody as cunning.

96
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:47,470
But innocence is thousand times blessed by
the Divine. The Divine blesses the innocence.

97
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:57,679
Now you might say 'How is it Mother so many
people are killed who were innocent? How it

98
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:06,390
has happened?' It's alright, they were not
realised souls, and some of them, like Christ,

99
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,919
went through through the ordeal. It has a
meaning His crucifixion has a very great meaning.

100
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,640
For us it is of great help because He crucified
himself. Now we can pass through the Agnya

101
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,289
chakra.

102
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:39,289
Every one have, they all of them have helped
so much in building up your Kundalini, in

103
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:49,669
helping you and working it out. All their
so-called ordeals and sacrifices have done

104
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,140
so much which you will understand through
your witness state. It's all like in a garden,

105
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:15,409
everybody has to work, the gardener has to
work, then the seed is put in and the Mother

106
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Earth has to work and the water has to work
and then it sprouts. Still it takes time,

107
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,260
then you see when it is a blossom time, all
the flowers are there, but behind those flowers

108
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:46,270
there's such a big effort of people. In the
same way, all those people who have put in

109
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,120
their effort are within us and they will help
us.

110
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:05,120
With Sahaja Yoga, getting realisation, if
you don't spread Sahaja Yoga then you have

111
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:12,539
done no justice, justice to Sahaja Yoga. You
cannot help it, it's such a thing, just the

112
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:25,860
other way round like a man who is selfish.
A selfish man will never like to share but

113
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,740
a realised soul would like to share everything
with others and enjoy, enjoy the sharing.

114
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:47,220
So many beautiful people come up. They become
so beautiful and so nice, so relaxed, so balanced

115
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:56,649
that amazing, you are surprised at yourself
that 'I had all this treasure within me? All

116
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,220
this beauty within me? Which I am absolutely
enjoying.' You enjoy yourself you enjoy others

117
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,740
you enjoy every little bit of it.

118
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:25,740
So I bless you all from my heart. So many
of you got realisation. As I've told you we

119
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,980
have to change the destiny of human beings.
We have not come here to destroy but we have

120
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:42,539
come here to grown and the destiny has to
be changed and that is what we have to work

121
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,669
out.

122
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:53,760
May God bless you.

123
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Derek Lee: "Shri Mataji there are one or two
new people here" Shri Mataji: "So what do

124
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:17,919
they want?" (laughter) Derek Lee: "I don't
know if you want to answer questions or ask

125
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,559
them to feel..."

126
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,559
Shri Mataji: (laughing) "Alright! Derek is
trying to look after you all and he says that

127
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:44,299
there are many new people here and they would
like to ask you questions. (laughter) So you

128
00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:03,289
see sometimes I'm surprised because you become
just like a criminal or you have to confess

129
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:11,500
something. Like yesterday they asked me 'Are
you a Goddess?' I said 'Bapare, what should

130
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,240
I say?' I said 'Do you want me to confess
something?' Then they kept quiet. So now what's

131
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:31,549
all the questions. Questions should be related
to your growth and not to nonsensical things,

132
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:40,179
why waste energy? It's not a political party
or anything, it's something spiritual. So

133
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:50,950
if you want to ask, ask for your spiritual
growth."

134
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:20,020
Indian lady asks question in Hindi
Derek Lee: "She says she comes from America

135
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,990
and can't sleep because all things going around
in her head so she 

136
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,400
can't sleep"

137
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Shri Mataji: "I know about seven languages
but I'm trying to learn Italian which is very

138
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:13,850
difficult for me"
Seeker: "Buonasera, pranaam"

139
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Shri Mataji: "That much I know!"

140
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Seeker: "Would you say Sahaja Yoga includes
and subsumes other religions or is it a separate

141
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,400
religion?"

142
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Shri Mataji: "It includes. Of course, it includes
all the religions, all the essence of all

143
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:08,750
the religions. Religion is again step by step
is a warning to human beings. How can you

144
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:17,279
exclude? But the essence, the essence of religion,
not all the humbug that people have done."

145
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:28,270
Seeker: "From deep inside my heart I'd like
to thank you for not only what you have done

146
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:52,370
for me but for what you've done for thousands
and thousands of people all over the world."

147
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,470
(applause)

148
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:16,470
Shri Mataji: "I hope he's speaking for all
of you? (more applause) So joy giving. Such

149
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:07,589
a joy giving response. I mean it's like the
waves that touch the shore and then again

150
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:18,710
another series of waves start. You see there's
no end to it, it's so beautiful. Thank you,

151
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:25,890
thank you very much. Any other question?"

152
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Seeker: "Is there a right or a wrong way to
meditate?"

153
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:49,319
Shri Mataji: "There is no wrong way, I don't
understand. I mean, with respect, with respect

154
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:03,120
if you do any meditation it's perfect, but
first of all is your heart and your mind must

155
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:14,180
have respect. In anyway when you meditate,
you should do it with love, that's all. Love

156
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
will cleanse everything. I mean, if you stand
on your head and meditate, it's alright, but

157
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:40,279
there's no need to do that! (laughter) Just
sit down and meditate. What's that?"

158
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,640
Seeker: " What do you think of Sahaja Maithuna
to awaken the kundalini?"

159
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Shri Mataji: "If you want you can try. But
it's dangerous"

160
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:55,220
Seeker: "Are we just play things for a higher
being?"

161
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:16,230
Derek Lee: "He's puzzled why do we have free
will"

162
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:26,670
Shri Mataji: "You see spiritually people are
not matured very much and once they get realisation,

163
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:42,100
because it's so simple and so easy that they
don't understand the value of it. But those

164
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:50,910
who are matured, those who are real seekers
take to it very seriously. It's no question

165
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,480
of free will, it's your growth, your maturity.
Depends on that. Some people are really great

166
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:12,100
seekers and some are alright trying, and some
are doing it just because of some sort of

167
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:23,970
a fashion. It should be earnestly coming from
your heart that you are seeking the Truth.

168
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:30,970
That's very important. Those who want to shun
the Truth of course are no good, but those

169
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:39,589
who are half-hearted also, they take time,
but gradually, with experience, they jump

170
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,680
into it."

171
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Same seeker: "Shri Mataji surely those who
are less evolved and less open are the most

172
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,430
in need, surely it should come easier to them?"

173
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:03,430
Shri Mataji: "It is. It is easier for all
of you. I mean the way you got realisation

174
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:13,010
nobody could have believed it. I also couldn't
believe, in the beginning, how it is working

175
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,460
so fast. But, it works. Like you can say that
certain flowers bloom faster than others.

176
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,400
I'm not bothered on that point, because if
they have the slightest desire to be the Spirit,

177
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,040
they become. Also Divine is anxious to give
you. " (applause)

178
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Seeker: "You said meditate with love but I
was just trying to think what love is because

179
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:31,250
I don't really understand about love"

180
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:38,250
Shri Mataji: "ah! (laughter) I mean, love
is a human quality. What is there to understand?

181
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:52,720
People love even dogs and animals. Do you
have a dog? (laughter) Love means without

182
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,400
any malice, without any anger, something that
is desired. It's such an abstract thing that

183
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:23,589
you cannot put it in words but it's a feeling
within you and when you meditate with love

184
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:32,079
means that supposing you are very angry and
you are frustrated then you come meditate

185
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,079
and go on saying things like 'Mother, do this!
kill him! Do that!' It doesn't work out. But

186
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:52,329
in love means actually it is no thought. Love
is no thought it's just a feeling, feeling

187
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:04,010
of emancipation. Just a feeling "

188
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:19,390
Seeker: "How would you describe the benefits
of Sahaja Yoga meditation compared with other

189
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,660
types of meditation?"

190
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:43,660
Shri Mataji: "The first and foremost thing
is you must feel the vibrations on your hands.

191
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:56,359
Cool vibrations which is the Divine Love of
All-Pervading Power. You should feel it coming

192
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:07,940
out of your fontanelle bone area. With any
meditation it doesn't happen, anyone, then

193
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:20,300
that is not correct. This is the minimum that
should happen that you should feel your vibrations

194
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:31,390
like cool breeze on your hand and out of the
fontanelle bone area. This is the minimum

195
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:42,750
to start. With no meditation it happens. That
man in the window."

196
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:17,750
Seeker: "What has love got to do with religion?"

197
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:24,910
Shri Mataji: "It's the essence of religion
is love. Essence. What he's saying? You can't

198
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:46,339
hear me?"

199
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:53,339
Seeker: "People who are involved in religion
are often scared"

200
00:49:56,569 --> 00:50:03,569
Shri Mataji: "Correct, I agree, because they
are not religious"

201
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:15,359
Seeker: "Love doesn't need religion"
Shri Mataji: "Yes of course. Of course. It

202
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:27,140
doesn't need any name. Love is love. But there
is an innate religion within us. Innate religion

203
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:41,940
is the enlightenment of the Spirit. It's innate.
You may call it religion you may call it divine

204
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:54,230
love call it by any name but within us is
that source which creates a new personality

205
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:08,069
imbibed with love and that we can call as
an innate religion within."

206
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:39,339
Seeker: "Is Self-realisation the same as enlightenment?"

207
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:46,770
Shri Mataji: "Of course. There are many names."

208
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:01,190
Seeker: "Is Sahaja Yoga the only path to Self-realisation?"

209
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:08,190
Shri Mataji: "I should say yes. I haven't
seen any other"

210
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:29,890
Seeker: "Why do you need to raise the Kundalini
to meditate or to get enlightenment?"

211
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:53,460
Shri Mataji: "That's how it is made. Why do
you connect this (microphone) to the mains?

212
00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:00,460
In the same way, you are to be connected.
For the connection to the All-Pervading Power

213
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,640
your Kundalini has to be raised. Alright?"

214
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Seeker: "How does the Holy Ghost come in to
all of this?"

215
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:32,930
Shri Mataji: "It's the Holy Ghost only doing
everything! When you will come to Sahaja Yoga

216
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:44,670
and will go deep into it you will know. It's
all the work of Holy Ghost. I don't know why

217
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:55,670
they call it a ghost! (laughter)"

218
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:12,109
Seeker: "Is it dangerous to open up the seven
levels of awareness without proper guidance?"

219
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:23,140
Shri Mataji: "You see, it's only which can
do it and I don't think anyone knows how to

220
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:32,470
work it out that way, so it should be done
in a proper manner. But Kundalini knows, she

221
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:40,210
knows everything about you, and She knows
your problems and when She rises She does

222
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:48,109
it so sweetly without harming you without
troubling you, so best thing is to get your

223
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,680
Self-realisation established."

224
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,680
Seeker: "How do you raise the Kundalini?"

225
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:17,079
Shri Mataji: "Me? Now I can't you see, what
I can do, no use telling you because you can't

226
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:34,630
do that, isn't it? You can raise the Kundalini
once you are a realised soul, you can also

227
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:45,510
raise, but maybe not like Me. When you reach
My stage you will! (applause and laughter)"

228
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:05,809
Seeker: "Can you tell us about your early
life when you first realised about Self-realisation"

229
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:20,859
Shri Mataji: "You see I think there's a book
about it. Alright? You better read it."

230
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:37,900
Seeker: "Can you tell me how we stimulate
the Kundalini to rise when we meditate at

231
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,520
home?"

232
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Shri Mataji: "I mean they know. There's a
photograph that they use to begin with and

233
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:56,420
that helps. But you must come to centres where
they tell you exactly what is to be done.

234
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:05,010
Little bit time has to be given to understand
it. You must all come to the centre, how many

235
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:12,819
of you come to the centre raise your hand.
See, not even 10%. Please put it down. So

236
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:27,309
it is important that you should go to the
centre, master it, become a full fledged,

237
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:35,930
I should say, sahaja yogi and give realisations
to others, that's, your duty bound, you have

238
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:43,700
to do it. Otherwise it's like what Christ
has said that some seeds fell on the rock

239
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:53,630
and some seeds fell in the marshy land and
some in the fertile. If you are a person of

240
00:57:54,809 --> 00:58:01,809
fertile temperament it will work out. Alright?"

241
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:14,819
Seeker: "Is Self-realisation when you realise
that you are everything?"

242
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:23,790
Shri Mataji: "When you are a realised soul,
if you are that, but do you feel the vibrations?

243
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:36,380
Do you feel vibrations of others? Then you
are not it's just a myth"

244
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:43,380
Seeker: "It has happened to me but it was
such a shock that I came back in to the body"

245
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:59,730
Shri Mataji: "You better take to, seriously,
to Sahaja Yoga. Alright?"

246
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,880
Seeker: "When you describe the state of thoughtless
awareness you make it so beautiful it sounds

247
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:26,720
so simple so why for some is it so difficult
to achieve?"

248
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,720
Shri Mataji: "I know, I know, I know, but
one has to work it out, that you look at something

249
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:42,180
without thinking. Try! Try to do that. I know
it's difficult for some people because too

250
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,980
much of thoughts in the mind all the time.
Now the thought comes from the left or from

251
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:55,980
the right, that is it comes from the past,
from our conditionings, and comes from the

252
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:03,240
right with our ego and futuristic ideas. All
the time. So one thought will rise, fall,

253
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:12,180
another will fall and rise and we are jumping
on the cusp of the thoughts. But when Kundalini

254
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:19,180
rises, what happens that these thoughts elongate
and the space in between is created that is

255
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,680
thoughtless awareness. Now how to do it is
the problem with people. [By] raising your

256
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:34,680
Kundalini. You raise your Kundalini, raise
the Kundalini of others, suddenly you will

257
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:42,309
find that you become thoughtlessly aware.
Not difficult. What's that?"

258
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,660
Seeker: "It's not a question really, a friend
brought me tonight and I came here with a

259
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:21,160
lot of scepticism but I appreciated the directness
and the simplicity of what you said and the

260
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,240
way you explained things."

261
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:32,240

Seeker: "Is there a reason why the Divine
love expresses itself as a cool breeze?"

263
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:58,880
Shri Mataji: "We should ask the Divine Love
about it"

Seeker: "Can you see a day coming when we
have a global Self-realisation amongst world

265
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:49,240
leaders so that people don't starve the way
they do at the moment? Can you see that within

266
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,460
the age of aquarius?"

267
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:57,359
Shri Mataji: "This is the Age of Aquarius.
This is the Age, but we can't say how many

268
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:04,359
will be there, saved. We can't say. If you
people work it out you can save so many. But

269
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,200
this is the Age of Aquarius no doubt, no doubt.

Seeker: "How do you forgive absolutely?"

271
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:44,270
Shri Mataji: "Whether you forgive or you don't
forgive you don't do anything. What do you

272
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:51,770
do? Alright? But when you don't forgive, mentally,
then you suffer, not the other person."

273
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:08,990
Seeker: "How can you change your heart so
that you can forgive?"

274
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:16,630
Shri Mataji: "Heart is not needed. Only you
understand that, whether you forgive or you

275
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,799
don't forgive you don't do anything. You just
say 'I forgive' "

Seeker: "I can say it but I don't mean it"

277

Shri Mataji: "You may not mean but it's a
mantra, you just say 'I forgive everyone'

278
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:53,420
Alright? It acts. It acts"

of psychiatric problems?"

problems?"

us all and we are all part of God and for

Is this what your trying to do?"

Shri Mataji: "Yes. But what I'm saying is
-- first you get your realisation established,

290
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:32,430
you get alright, you perfect yourself and
then you can do it yourself."

01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:38,490
(same seeker tries to ask the same question
again! )

292
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:45,490
Shri Mataji: "You work it out till I come
next time and you won't ask any questions!"

293
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:24,339
(applause)

294
01:08:24,339 --> 01:08:31,339
Seeker: "Does Mother protect us in Sahaja
Yoga wherever we are?"

295
01:08:39,889 --> 01:08:46,889
Shri Mataji: "Of course but I don't want to
say that. You can experience."

296
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:55,259
Seeker: "How do I know when I've had my Self-realisation?"

297
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:15,799
Shri Mataji: "You will feel the cool breeze
blowing into your hands and out of your fontanelle

298
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:29,520
bone area. That's the first step, first step."

299
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:36,980
Seeker: "When doing Sahaja Yoga is it alright
still to use other spiritual stuff like Reiki

300
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:50,639
and Crystals"

301
01:09:50,639 --> 01:09:57,639
Shri Mataji: "No, no! Reiki's experience has
been very bad. No no no no! If you ask me

302
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:43,440
I would say 

303
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:17,710
don't 

304
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:28,719
do because I know how people have suffered
with that. It's unscientific.

305
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:46,370
Now can you 
all please put your hands towards me and close
your eyes. Forget about 
all 
the questions..."
