Shivaratri Puja, Pune (India)

00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,700
16 March 2003

3
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:57,963
Today we are going to worship Shri Shiva, Sadashiva.

4
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:08,463
His quality is that He is forgiveness personified.

5
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:15,463
The amount of forgiveness He has,

6
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:19,173
has helped many of us to exist,

7
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:23,883
otherwise this world would have perished,

8
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:27,303
so many would have been finished

9
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:33,173
because you know what is the condition of human beings.

10
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,883
They don't understand what is wrong, what is right.

11
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:43,463
Apart from that, they cannot forgive.

12
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:47,673
They go on making mistakes- doesn't matter.

13
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:51,173
But they cannot forgive others.

14
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:58,593
This is what we have to learn from Shri Sadashiva.

15
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:12,883
Today we are going to worship Shri Sadashiva.

16
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:24,383
He is the embodiment of forgiveness, so powerful that

17
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:31,803
nobody is able to be against him, to challenge him.

18
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:42,173
He forgives all our mistakes, no matter what they are.

19
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:46,303
If he does not, he could banish the world because

20
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:49,673
within him there is a destructive power which

21
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,963
is able to ruin the entire creation.

22
00:04:55,303 --> 00:05:02,963
Although forgiveness is his inherent quality

23
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:08,963
this power of destruction could be awakened within him as well.

24
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:15,303
His power of forgiveness increases gradually until it

25
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:20,093
becomes mature and then finally he is able to destroy.

26
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:28,963
So first of all we need to acquire his quality of forgiveness.

27
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:36,093
We as human beings are capable of forgiving to some

28
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:42,803
extent but, nevertheless we get angry and are ready to quarrel.

29
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:51,803
But now He, who is the embodiment of forgiveness itself,

30
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:58,713
reaches the point where his destructive power

31
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,883
could be awakened?

32
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:10,883
How does that happen?

33
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,303
Once his power is awakened,

34
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,593
he is able to banish even himself,

35
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:24,713
the whole universe and every creation he has already created.

36
00:06:25,013 --> 00:06:30,923
So people should remember that in case we have not

37
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:35,593
learned to forgive and forgiveness is not established

38
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:42,713
within us, this destructive power will be awakened one day.

39
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:46,803
And then we will destroy even our own people.

40
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:53,423
That's why you should always keep in mind

41
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:59,013
that there is no need to get angry

42
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:05,923
with others in vain.

43
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:11,303
You have absolutely no right to be angry with others.

44
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:20,133
If Shiva is not doing so why should you?

45
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:27,133
But people get angry extremely often and very heavily.

46
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:34,713
Animals never get angry to such an extent.

47
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,923
They won't get annoyed without any reason.

48
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:43,713
Thus while getting angry at small things

49
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:51,213
we should always remember that

50
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,133
the power of Shri Shiva exists within us as well.

51
00:07:56,423 --> 00:08:03,713
Forgetting that Shiva exists within us is exactly what

52
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:11,713
makes us get angry with people

53
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:20,423
and unable to forgive their faults and mistakes.

54
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:26,423
But what makes us act like this

55
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:31,343
and what can such a person achieve?

56
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:37,343
Wherever and whenever big events and occasions

57
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:44,713
have occurred men have started to destroy

58
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:52,343
other people out of pride and arrogance.

59
00:08:53,013 --> 00:09:00,343
This destructive power was even stronger in the past when

60
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:07,843
people were banishing each other without any reason.

61
00:09:08,513 --> 00:09:14,513
We do not need to think about where

62
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:19,633
has this attitude come from and why.

63
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:25,513
The only thing we need to remember is not to fix

64
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:33,053
our attention on such an inferior thing.

65
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:43,713
If we could live in peace, if we could be able

66
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:48,553
to see the peace in every single thing,

67
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:54,713
we would be capable of making our lives peaceful too.

68
00:09:55,053 --> 00:10:01,133
But the point is that human beings

69
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:06,553
are not able to control themselves.

70
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:14,713
Moreover, they feel pleased getting angry with

71
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:21,423
someone and giving punishment,

72
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:29,263
to such an extent that even countries could be involved.

73
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:34,843
If a person starts to quarrel with another one

74
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:41,763
from a different country, all the people go behind him

75
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:45,843
and nobody thinks of discussing, everyone is ready to fight.

76
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:50,553
This inclination of human beings is very strange.

77
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:54,133
How could one feel happy

78
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:58,463
because of getting angry withsomeone,

79
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:03,053
suppression, fighting

80
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:08,343
or killing someone?

81
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:13,053
But you can see for yourself.

82
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:17,263
Imagine that while travelling on

83
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:24,843
the road you see a crowd gathered.

84
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:28,963
What are you going to do?

85
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:37,763
Some of you will join the crowd, but some will just watch.

86
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:44,553
Sometimes such strange outbursts

87
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:47,343
in our temper are a sign that

88
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:52,463
the power of Shri Shiva inside us comes out.

89
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:58,263
By worshipping this power heartily human anger

90
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:00,673
and wrath could be banished.

91
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:06,263
It is considered an auspicious thing that

92
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:16,553
even Shri Krishna has done this greatest feat out of anger.

93
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:25,263
All the things were born out of anger, the whole creation.

94
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:30,963
But you people are very proud with what you've done

95
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:35,843
and consider yourself very powerful because of that.

96
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:42,463
I am very angry with you about that.

97
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:50,173
I can not see the beauty of humanity in your behaviour.

98
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:57,673
To get angry for small things is a very typical thing.

99
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:02,343
You get angry very easily

100
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:10,463
and are not able to find an excuse for someone's faults.

101
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:18,463
But this anger can cause many troubles - wars can begin,

102
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:25,343
homes can be ruined and countries can be banished.

103
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:27,963
With every passing day I can see human anger

104
00:13:28,553 --> 00:13:35,173
and wrath not decreasing but increasing

105
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:38,963
and people proclaiming it with pride.

106
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:42,673
I know you want Me to speak in English language, only.

107
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:50,263
But people who don't know English are outnumbering you.

108
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,673
What I'm trying to say,

109
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:57,763
that it's very important

110
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:02,963
to understand when you are worshipping Shri Shivashankar

111
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:09,763
that He is the complete embodiment of forgiveness.

112
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,463
He forgives.

113
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,883
He forgives everything very sweetly.

114
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:20,963
As one would forgive all small children.

115
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,263
He forgives.

116
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,463
He doesn't get angry.

117
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:31,263
He's not that easily perturbed.

118
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:38,093
Also we have certain amount of prejudices.

119
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:43,383
For example, a woman in India,

120
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:49,593
if she speaks, then people don't like it.

121
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:53,463
A woman should not speak, a man can speak.

122
00:14:54,803 --> 00:14:57,593
And a woman can never beat

123
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,883
- a woman can never beat a man,

124
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,383
even if the man kills the wife.

125
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:09,173
That is the criteria of a good wife in India, or a good woman.

126
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:15,173
So you can imagine how men are getting towards their discretion.

127
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:20,673
All this kind of concession that is given,

128
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:27,803
is very dangerous, is the destructive of the whole community.

129
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,593
Same I've seen abroad.

130
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,803
There are people who go on beating their wives,

131
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,673
killing their wives - I don't know all kinds of things.

132
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:43,383
Because they have married somebody,
they think they have every right

133
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:46,963
to expect everything good from their wives,

134
00:15:47,673 --> 00:15:50,383
while they may not be at all good,

135
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:54,303
and they go on torturing their wives.

136
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:58,593
Not only that but in the school, the teachers,

137
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,803
they ill-treat the students so badly, the students pick it up.

138
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:09,803
And later on they carry on the tradition

139
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:13,513
of beating others and troubling others.

140
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:17,513
So every time you say, "I get very angry,"

141
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:23,213
tell yourself you are on the wrong path.

142
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:27,303
I've told so many times to so many of you

143
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:35,213
that to boast of your anger is the worst thing because

144
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:46,093
it is like boasting about your sins you are committing.

145
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,213
These are the sins.

146
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:53,593
I can understand some people who are drunkards,

147
00:16:54,923 --> 00:17:00,963
or some who are mad, or some who are out of their minds

148
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:05,963
- but a mad person you'll find very, very sensible otherwise,

149
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:14,213
can be very ferocious, can be very dangerous.

150
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:21,423
It is difficult to say from where do you get these qualities,

151
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:27,213
because none of the Divine Personalities

152
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,803
had this kind of thing.

153
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:35,213
For no rhyme and reason They won't lose their temper

154
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:40,803
and even if They do, it has to be a very strong

155
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,713
reason up to the point of destruction.

156
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,633
But I can understand Them,

157
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:52,633
because They have to maintain this world

158
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,713
and They have to look after

159
00:17:57,513 --> 00:18:02,303
the people who are supposed to be human beings.

160
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:08,213
But sometimes I've seen human beings are

161
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,213
even worse than animals.

162
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,513
They get provoked for nothing at all.

163
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,013
What is the reason? Why are you angry?

164
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:23,513
They'll give you an excuse which is absolutely unreasonable.

165
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:32,133
In this world you have come to enjoy peace and joy.

166
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,633
Without peace, you can't have joy.

167
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:41,133
If you cannot give peace to others, how can you have joy?

168
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:48,633
And the way people treat others in such a contemptuous manner,

169
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,633
it's very surprising, what do they think of themselves?

170
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:58,923
Why should they think so low about other people?

171
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:08,053
It's beyond understanding to see a man losing temper

172
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,553
on small, small things.

173
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,713
But actually they are cowards.

174
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:21,713
If it comes to some facing some real problem in life,

175
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:27,423
they recede back. Then they cannot come forward.

176
00:19:28,213 --> 00:19:33,133
This is the biggest tragedy of the whole thing.

177
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:42,553
In our country hot-tempered people are very well known too.

178
00:19:43,553 --> 00:19:48,213
In the villages they call them tetchy or naggers, or flares-up.

179
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:51,553
Nobody likes to live with them.

180
00:19:51,843 --> 00:19:58,763
All right. Imagine that someone has done a mistake. Forgive him!

181
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:06,633
If somebody has done something very wrong, forgive him

182
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:11,923
because tomorrow you could be in the same situation.

183
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:16,423
And then someone could come and ask you questions

184
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:18,923
and you could be given a punishment.

185
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:28,263
So you should understand that as Sahaja yogis

186
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:37,343
you have  absolutely no right to preach and punish anybody.

187
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:43,423
You have to respect Shri Shiva.
This is the right thing to be done.

188
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:48,263
So one has the nature of Shri Shiva within himself,

189
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:52,553
one is on the right path and is protected by Shri Shiva.

190
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:58,843
Those who have open hearted

191
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:02,553
and fair have nothing to be concerned about.

192
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:09,553
Shri Shivshankar looks after them and takes care of them.

193
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:15,263
If it is so, then why do you need to get angry at all?

194
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,053
That's very strange.

195
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:28,763
All the time you trust other people for your good prospects.

196
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,843
And at the same time,

197
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:36,963
you are not able  to forgive anything which is wrong.

198
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:44,843
When somebody has made a mistake

199
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:49,263
you wish that he would be ruined.

200
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:54,673
Unless and until you overcome this desire,

201
00:21:54,963 --> 00:22:01,463
you will not be able to understand your real nature.

202
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:08,763
And you won't be able to answer the question.

203
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:14,673
"Are you a human or an animal?"

204
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:22,343
Animals never get angry without reason.

205
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:26,343
The power of Shivaji is very strong inside them.

206
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:33,463
But man is exactly the one who is able

207
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,763
to completely destroy all human beings.

208
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:43,383
He reckons he has the right to destroy

209
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:48,263
hundreds of thousands of people. Such a man was Hitler.

210
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:54,763
He killed so many people without even creating a small child

211
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:58,463
Who did he think he was?

212
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:02,963
The families of all these people have also bee ruined

213
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:07,053
and their countries were destroyed too.

214
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,463
Who did that man think he was?

215
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,883
There were a few more people like him in the world

216
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:21,763
but you do not need to follow his example.

217
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:28,553
You are Sahaja Yogis so you have to forgive.

218
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:32,763
Fair and open-hearted people are capable of forgiving.

219
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:36,173
Their quality of forgiveness is very strong.

220
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:40,763
But the very embodiment of forgiveness

221
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:46,463
is Shri Shivashankar.

222
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:52,963
That's why He is the supreme one.

223
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:56,673
He doesn't need any property.

224
00:23:57,093 --> 00:24:00,593
He can wear any clothing,

225
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:03,383
but if he hasn't got any,

226
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:08,303
he would simply put some ash to cover his body.

227
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,803
He can live and survive in any circumstances.

228
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:15,463
He has no need of anything.

229
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,383
But is someone feels wrath

230
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:24,673
and tortures somebody,

231
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:29,673
finally Shri Shiva will destroy him.

232
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,303
His power of forgiveness is as strong as his power of destruction.

233
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,463
Why is it so?

234
00:24:38,303 --> 00:24:43,463
Because when a man sees somebody being oppressed,

235
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:47,383
he should feel pity and should know

236
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:50,093
that if someone dares to behave like this

237
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:56,963
- oppressing others, he will be finished soon.

238
00:24:57,673 --> 00:25:02,963
Today not many people dare to act like this.

239
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:09,593
In the past there were many more.

240
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:19,513
They were famous for having tortured
and killed lots of people,

241
00:25:20,593 --> 00:25:27,593
and having interfered in many countries and destroying them.

242
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:33,303
But today, nobody hangs their pictures on the wall,

243
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:38,213
nobody remembers them,
nobody worships them as idols.

244
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:43,803
Nobody remembers their faces either.

245
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:47,093
You do not need to build such a temper.

246
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:52,803
You'd better try to understand that if you are hot-tempered,

247
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:59,383
people might obey you out of fear.

248
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:04,593
But you will be pleased with something

249
00:26:04,883 --> 00:26:07,303
done under a threat?

250
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:12,713
And what is so special about that?

251
00:26:13,383 --> 00:26:19,713
Consider for yourself how many people

252
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:24,513
have you been  angry with in this world

253
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:28,213
and how many people you have destroyed?

254
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:34,923
How many people you have quarrelled with?

255
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:43,923
There are some people whose dharma is to be wrathful

256
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:48,093
and to quarrel for small things all the time.

257
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:50,513
Hey will argue with someone in the morning,

258
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:56,093
with someone else in the afternoon

259
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:00,923
and with someone else in the evening.

260
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:05,513
People keep away from such individuals.

261
00:27:05,803 --> 00:27:07,923
They will even cross the street in order

262
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,803
to avoid such a quarrel some person.

263
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:17,633
All this can be overcome only through pure love.

264
00:27:18,423 --> 00:27:21,133
Sahaja yoga is the pure love

265
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:30,213
and we have Jesus Christ as a great example to follow.

266
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:36,133
If we have established within us the quality of forgiveness

267
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:43,213
to the same extent as Christ has, we will be able to realize

268
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:50,923
the true nature of Shri Shiva and acquire his qualities.

269
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,013
To get angry with someone is not unusual at all.

270
00:27:54,843 --> 00:28:00,713
That's why today all of you have to consider for yourself

271
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:08,633
- do you wish to destroy some other people

272
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:13,923
and living creatures and to what extent?

273
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:21,013
As Sahaja Yogis, you should completely give up this

274
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:26,713
because it is useless and it isn't worth doing.

275
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:30,343
Today while worshipping Shri Shiva,

276
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:35,633
you people make a decision not to

277
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:41,633
get angry in any situation.

278
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:44,053
If it makes no sense,

279
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:48,423
why do you need to feel wrath?

280
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:55,053
You doing that will just make you feel worse.

281
00:28:55,343 --> 00:29:00,843
So today, let us all worship Shri Shiva

282
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:05,343
and pray for acquiring his qualities.

283
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,923
May God bless you.
