and then try to put your guru in the

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:54,190
core of it after establishing in the

realization is not imagination because

now your mind your imagination is itself

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:28,710
enlightened so project yourself in such

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:32,000
a way that you humble down at the feet

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,079

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:16,600
one with the divine now if there are

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,720
thoughts coming in first you have to say

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:26,890

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:31,209
inside also you must say mantra of

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,440
Ganesha will help some people and then

25
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,440
you should watch inside

26
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:49,739
and see for yourself which is the

27
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,739
biggest hurdle for the part

28
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,470
now for the thought you have to say the

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:05,520
mantra of nearly Chara that Thomas

35
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,810
because see your thought has stopped now

36
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:59,850
no doubt but there's still the pressure

37
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:04,430
on the head so if it is ego you have to

38
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:08,880
say so many visage are MOT ahankara

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,790
now even now if you find that ego is

46
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,520
still there then you have to raise your

47
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,340
left side to push it back to the right

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:19,570
hand side with your hand one hand

towards the photograph push the left

50
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,910
side higher and right side lower so the

51
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,910
ego and super-ego get the balance

52
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:42,950
do it seven times try to feel how you

53
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,950
