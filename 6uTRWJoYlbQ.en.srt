1
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,740
First of all we should know what powers we
have got, and also we should know how we are

2
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,440
going to preserve those powers and what more
powers we can very easily achieve.

3
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:30,640
The first power that you get after Realisation
is the greatest power on Earth. This is the

4
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:47,830
power of Shri Ganesha. It is only He can do
this job that you people are doing today,

5
00:01:47,830 --> 00:02:01,960
and that power is of raising the Kundalini.
No one so far in the history of spirituality

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,610
has ever raised the Kundalini in such a short
time as you people are doing. It moves under

7
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:18,560
your fingers; it is absolutely Shri Ganesha’s
power which is given to you.

8
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:34,569
At the time when you are giving the Realisation,
even if you are caught up in any one of your

9
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:42,069
chakras, or you have any problem, even if
you are little bit possessed, even if you

10
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:52,489
are not such a good Sahaj Yogi, even if you
are not that much surrendered to Mataji, even

11
00:02:52,489 --> 00:03:03,480
if you don’t have much sense of obligation
about Sahaj Yoga, still the Kundalini rises

12
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:11,499
under your fingers. This Ganesha key is given
to you by Shri Ganesh Himself within you;

13
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:21,549
to give you the confidence, to give you the
confidence that you can raise the Kundalini,

14
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:35,980
but not the feeling that you are raising the
Kundalini. If you go on without surrendering

15
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,150
yourself to Sahaj Yoga, after some time you
will lose this power, very fast.

16
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:55,769
The another power which you have got: At the
raising of the Kundalini of anyone, you can

17
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:07,169
notice it that, when the Kundalini rises,
that time there will be no obstruction of

18
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:14,150
any kind. Whatever may be the obstructions
around – say there’s a possessed person

19
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:25,370
next door, he would not disturb you at that
time. In your family there may be a person

20
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,730
who is a negative person, but if you are raising
the Kundalini, at that moment he will be kept

21
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,920
quiet.
At the time when you are moving your hand

22
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,660
on the Kundalini [it] is the greatest power
you are using. I don’t know how much shraddha

23
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,450
you have about yourself and about the power
that you have. At that time there will be

24
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:56,340
no obstruction on your hand by anyone whatsoever!
Even by mistake, nobody will hold your hand

25
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:15,010
or touch your hand.
The second power you have got when you are

26
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:30,380
raising the Kundalini, [is] that, at that
time when you will be raising your Kundalini,

27
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:44,620
you will be completely attracting the attention
of the another person within, like a magnet,

28
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,990
by which you should understand that you can
raise your Kundalini wherever you feel like.

29
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:58,460
When you are raising the Kundalini, supposing
there’s lot of noise going on, there are

30
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,180
all kinds of problems going on – supposing
you are going in the train, there’s a noise

31
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:14,110
of the train, or any such thing happening
– that time your attention will not be distracted,

32
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:24,740
but the attention of the person who is taking
the Realisation from you will not be attracted

33
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,700
by outside things at that time when you are
raising the Kundalini. That means that you

34
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:42,800
can give Realisation at any time because at
that time you reside in the lotus which is

35
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:55,310
closed.
The other power you have got, at the time

36
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:08,420
of Kundalini jagruti (awakening), that no
baser feelings will rise within you. Even

37
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,040
if you are a possessed person, at the time
of Kundalini jagruti you will not have baser

38
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:21,730
feelings, impure feelings about the person
whom you are giving Realisation. Maybe before

39
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:28,370
and after but not during, when you are giving
Realisation, these dirty feelings will not

40
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:35,250
come to you – automatically, you don’t
have to stop your mind, automatically it will

41
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,700
work out. You will be absolutely satisfied,
even if you are hungry you will not feel the

42
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,389
hunger or any physical need, at the time when
you are giving Realisation. There will be

43
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:58,650
no distraction of any kind; you won’t do
anything that is indignified at the time when

44
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:12,169
you will be raising your hand, because you
are being blessed with dignity. At the time

45
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:20,060
you are raising the Kundalini, you will never
joke, or you will never make fun, you will

46
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,889
not be frivolous – automatically! You try,
it won’t work out.

47
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:37,589
But these are your supporting powers. All
these five powers I have described are very

48
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:55,350
few of the thousands others, but these are
the five powers of Shri Ganesh.

49
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:10,249
Now these powers can be maintained if you
try to follow Shri Ganesh. His foremost quality

50
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:20,240
is that He does not know any other god or
anybody else higher than His own Mother. A

51
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,870
complete dedication and complete obedience
to Mother. I mean, sort of He is made out

52
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:37,129
of that obedience. Complete love and affection
for the Mother. He doesn’t argue, He doesn’t

53
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:45,290
question, He doesn’t do anything, and that’s
how these powers are, in Him, the maximum.

54
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:53,879
If you think by arguing with Me you are gaining,
you are sadly mistaken. You have to keep Me

55
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:07,860
pleased. Even Ganesha tries every minute to
keep Me pleased. Is a fact. So, please don’t

56
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:16,660
try to displease Me. I may not say anything
because outwardly I don’t say anything,

57
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:33,670
but your powers will be reduced.
The Ganesha’s fifth power is the power of

58
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:46,470
wisdom and that whatever He knows He can draw
it and write it down. Even that power you

59
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:56,100
have got. When you are raising the Kundalini,
you talk to the person in such a manner that

60
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:10,360
the person becomes wise. And you also talk
to him only that which is wisdom and also

61
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:19,899
you write or show him figures, automatically
which are right. Even if you don’t remember

62
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:35,209
your figures, they will come out right.
Now the three powers of Adi Shakti work in

63
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:58,029
you. One gives you longevity 
and a clear-cut idea about your desires. If
your desires are right, all your desires are

64
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:04,929
fulfilled by this power – all your desires,
all! But the first one, one should know that

65
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:12,709
your desires should be right. For example,
now Sahaja Yogis want their ashram. Why do

66
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:25,529
they want ashram for? How many are willing
to stay in the ashram? How many are going

67
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:34,529
to take their children in the ashram? How
many are going to give their exclusive homes

68
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:44,300
and take their wives or take their husbands
who are not Sahaja Yogis in the ashram? And

69
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,839
how many of them are wanting only ashram just
because they will have some place to live

70
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:58,509
in a cheap manner? What is the purpose of
getting an ashram? Are you sure about it?

71
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:05,610
Have you been able to find out why do you
want an ashram?

72
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:15,040
If your desires are clear-cut then they will
be fulfilled, absolutely hundred percent.

73
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:25,389
That power you can achieve only by putting
your bandhan on your heart. Whatever desire

74
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:31,420
you have, you say it and put it on your heart.
Means you’re asking from your heart. Seven

75
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:40,240
times, you just give it a bandhan and the
work will be done. But don’t use it for

76
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:48,559
nonsensical things, because if you use it
for nonsensical things, this power will go

77
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:55,709
away. Use for something special, of a higher
level.

78
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:10,899
Now, by your second power you will automatically
meet people who are learned and who are sahaja.

79
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:19,029
You will also read books which are sahaja.
Even if you have to read some other books,

80
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:32,829
you will be able to know that this is not
correct and this is correct. And by that you

81
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:39,309
will be enriching your mind. When you will
start speaking, people will be amazed. Those

82
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,959
who have never spoken would be speaking very
well. Those who have never known poetry will

83
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:54,179
be writing poetry. Lots of things will happen
on the field of art also. Those who did not

84
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:06,470
know art will do marvellously in art.
But by the first power, which is the Adi Shakti’s

85
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:18,079
power or Mahakali’s power, you get the love
of all the people around. Everybody will feel

86
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:32,459
magnetically attracted towards you. And you
will be always guided by great souls and angels.

87
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:40,989
If you come across anybody who is meeting
an accident, you will stop that man from going

88
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:48,069
that way. If you are in an accident everybody
will be saved. You will seldom have an accident

89
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:55,119
-if you have it, you won’t be hurt much.
Amazing! All these powers come to you because

90
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:07,949
you are the children of Adi Shakti. The whole
Universe of the subtle, Divine Power is looking

91
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:16,470
after you individually. You’re all marked,
the mark is on you, you are bearing the mark,

92
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:34,699
and They are looking after you.
So this power of desiring is the power that

93
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:47,170
protects you. In all the way that is possible
it guides you, it looks after you, it gives

94
00:16:47,170 --> 00:17:08,910
you peace. And this power gives you tremendous
faith in Sahaja Yoga. Ultimately you become

95
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:15,720
filled with the joy of Sahaj Yoga, and you
don’t like anything else but Sahaj Yoga.

96
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,930
To you, everything is Sahaja Yoga. But sometimes,
you know, we are identified with our ego and

97
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:26,620
we think our ego is Sahaj Yog, many a times
I have seen that. People like it because it

98
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:34,610
is identified with their ego. It should be
separated from that and should be brought

99
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,710
in our lives, in our day-to-day life, when
we are meeting each other, when we are talking

100
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:47,790
to each other, that joy one should see, one
ripple falling and another rising, another

101
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:54,300
falling, as you see in the sea. Becoming one
with each other. This power is within you

102
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,080
and it is working all the time that you are
loved and you are looked after.

103
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:06,500
By the middle power, I have told you, you
will give Realisation to people. You will

104
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,230
be able to tell their chakras. You will be
able to correct your chakras. This is all

105
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:23,500
by your centre power. And by this power only
you have a very great power over your will.

106
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:31,480
If you decide that you are going to be like
this you will be. If you want to be a happy

107
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:42,510
person you will be. The transformation will
be at your hand. You can transform yourself

108
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:53,720
without any difficulty that will work out,
if you use the central power of Mahalakshmi.

109
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:04,180
Of course, you will get better jobs, better
money, prospects, but not too much of it.

110
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,630
So much so, that you will feel very much satisfied
about it. So that your attention is more in

111
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:19,130
the centre. All other powers of Mahalakshmi
you will achieve later on.

112
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,760
There are many other powers of Mahalakshmi
which you have to achieve, but for that your

113
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,250
Sushumna has to be cleaned very much. For
that, you have to develop detachment in life.

114
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:45,010
Unless and until you develop detachment the
deeper powers of Mahalakshmi do not come up.

115
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:57,650
For example, even in the smaller things, like
having connection with Me, even that one is

116
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:07,750
to be a detached way. Even to say Aarti or
to do something, to come forward, that, “I

117
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:16,490
have to do it.” Even to invite Me for dinner
or this thing, every small thing, that “I

118
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:21,740
should do it,” is also attachment. If it
works out, well and good; if it does not work

119
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,730
out, well and good. You must say that, “Mother,
You come.” But if I cannot come, there should

120
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,880
not be slightest feeling an unhappiness, but
should be accepted as a part of that. This

121
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,920
detachment has to be developed for your Mahalakshmi
Power.

122
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:51,110
Then you go beyond. Your timing will be worked
out absolutely correctly – you won’t have

123
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:58,230
to see the time. There will be time which
will be your own. Whenever you will go, you

124
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:05,450
will find [that] everything worked out well.
So, to preserve this power of time, you must

125
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:13,030
not hurry-up too much, you should not be slaves
of watches. Just let it go. Do not have any

126
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,150
obstinacy about anything. Just doesn’t matter:
if it is ten o’clock, alright; if not, if

127
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,160
ten fifteen, doesn’t matter. Just allow
yourself to be drifted with the flow of Sahaja

128
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:29,820
Yoga. If it works out, well and good, if it
does not work out, well and good. Just keep

129
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,420
it like that. Then only you will be surprised
how this Mahalakshmi Power improves, and the

130
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:43,930
blessings of this power are tremendous.
Like that you have thousand and one powers

131
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,360
already awakened within you. For example on
Vishuddhi Chakra, you have sixteen thousand

132
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:59,590
powers, and all these sixteen [thousand] powers
are awakened in you, today as you are. Sixteen

133
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:08,260
thousand powers are awakened within you as
you are today. But when you speak you don’t

134
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,360
understand that when you are speaking you
are a Sahaja Yogi [and] with all these powers

135
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:21,480
you are speaking. When you eat you don’t
understand that this tongue belongs to a Sahaja

136
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,630
Yogi; you should not hanker after anything.
Like if somebody likes tea, he will go on

137
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:36,960
taking fifteen cups. That’s no good. If
he’s fond of one sort of a food, he won’t

138
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,980
take another food. Thinking too much about
food all the time, asking for food and organising

139
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:55,120
food all the time, that spoils Vishuddhi very
badly. Then talking ill about anyone, complaining

140
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,490
about anyone to Me will spoil your Vishuddhi.
If there’s some sense, if I ask, then is

141
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:11,370
alright, but all the time talking ill about
each other will spoil your Vishuddhi. If possible,

142
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:19,900
try to talk good about others -always. By
telling good about another person you will

143
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,800
help yourself and another person. For example
say, one Mr. X comes and tells Me something

144
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:33,520
against Mr. Y – I’m just stunned, because
Mr. Y has come and already told Me that Mr.

145
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,800
X is a fine man. So I tell Mr. X, “How do
you say that about Mr. Y, because he was praising

146
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:51,940
you?” So he keeps absolutely in a shocked
condition and he doesn’t know how to answer.

147
00:23:51,940 --> 00:24:00,900
When you judge others, you should know that
you are judged by God. If you are judging

148
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:09,790
others, God has judged you also. So in His
judgment whatever marks you give to yourself

149
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:16,040
and to others are not going to be consulted
at all. It is His judgment which is going

150
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:26,430
to decide how far you are. Those who are in
Sahaj Yoga today, they may be some who think

151
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:33,880
that they are great Sahaj Yogis, big people.
But may be that they are not. And those who

152
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:43,400
do not think that they are any[thing] great,
they want to increase and improve their shakti,

153
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:51,630
they may be the people who are occupying very
high places. So, under these circumstances

154
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:58,890
one should never boast and should not have
wrong, false estimation about oneself. That

155
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:06,210
is the way you can preserve your powers much
better of your Vishuddhi, if you [don’t]

156
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,360
start talking ill about others to each other.
Also I’ve seen people start discussing Me,

157
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,450
and in a very funny way they do it. I think
the best way to deal with the problem is not

158
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:27,260
to speak about Me, and if you have to speak,
then know that it has to be absolutely positive,

159
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:33,330
otherwise you are harming yourself and you
are harming others. Then you don’t blame

160
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,940
Me for that!
So that’s how your Vishuddhi Chakra’s

161
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,840
problems are increasing, and they go on increasing.
Specially when you try to confuse yourself

162
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,010
and quarrel with yourself and you think that,
you see, Sahaj Yoga has gained by your coming

163
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:59,240
[then] you catch Vishuddhi. You have gained,
not Sahaj Yoga. Sahaj Yog is ruled by itself,

164
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:08,270
it doesn’t need your help. If there is Truth,
then by accepting Truth you are enhanced,

165
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,960
your position has gone up, not the position
of the Truth. So this idea from your head

166
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,360
must go right away – that you have any way
obliged the Sahaj Yoga, or that you have obliged

167
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,680
God by coming to Him! This idea must go down.
This will definitely make your head again

168
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,210
upside-down and your Kundalini will be again
back to its own position.

169
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:43,780
So to keep up even your Vishuddhi alright
is not easy according to many. But is the

170
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:51,560
easiest when you keep yourself in a state
of witness. And that is possible if you develop

171
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:01,590
the habit after Realisation, that everything
that you do or want or face is put into nirvicharita,

172
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:07,880
into thoughtless awareness. If you start that
habit you will be amazed – your witness

173
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,420
state will improve and that you will rise
in your being.

174
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:20,000
This is very important to understand that
without transformation, you have no meaning.

175
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,920
Whatever you have been, have been useless,
of no good. Whatever you are transformed,

176
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:33,200
you are of some use. So whatever you have
been, you do not be identified with that.

177
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,900
But whatever you have to be, you will try
to be that. And this power you have got, that

178
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,560
whatever you want, you will be that. But some
people are so funny that if you ask them,

179
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:50,250
“What do you want to be?” They will say
that, “I want to be a donkey!” All such

180
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,210
silly and foolish people are no good for Sahaj
Yog, once for all you must know. No use running

181
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:03,550
after such foolish people who have no sense
at all, and who are such gone cases. They

182
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:09,400
will come back, afterwards. But put your attention
on positivity and not on negativity.

183
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:15,110
Normally I have seen always negative people
turn towards the negative people. If there’s

184
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,820
one negative person standing, a person who
is negative will immediately go and talk to

185
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,560
that person, find out about that person, he
will have sympathy for that person; he’ll

186
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:30,700
like that person; all sorts of things will
be there. And first sign is that such a person

187
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:39,070
is a complete negatively possessed being.
Alright. Now if you have done that kind of

188
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:46,950
a thing, of being possessed or by getting
impressed by these negative people, you are

189
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:52,690
out. Either you are in the sea or out of it.
How can you be both? You’d better get out

190
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,060
from there and spare the rest. But if you
want to be in the sea then you must know that

191
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,530
you have to know swimming and you have to
take pride in swimming otherwise it has no

192
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:09,410
meaning, it is of no help.
Now you have got curative power, you know

193
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:16,730
that; you can cure people. But do not get
into that mess because there Mahamaya plays

194
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:30,890
Her part! If I find that you are getting into
your head the idea that you are very much

195
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,520
getting involved into a particular case of
your brother-in-law’s, father-in-law’s,

196
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:45,300
mother-in-law, then I’ll stop it, or you
get into trouble. If you start making money

197
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:51,610
out of it I’ll stop it. I do many things
by which I just stop it. And then you cannot

198
00:29:51,610 --> 00:30:00,080
have that power in you. On the contrary, you
will suffer quite a lot, because you do not

199
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,070
know how to protect yourself from all these
bad things.

200
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:09,340
So, I have to request you that before starting
curing others, you first cure yourself fully

201
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:16,400
and also you can use My photographs for curing
other people. But you must know that there

202
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,110
is a very subtle thing in human beings that
they want, that everybody should say that,

203
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:28,580
“Oh, you are great, you have cured so many
people!” in a very subtle way, on a very

204
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:35,060
subtle base. So, one should not bother about
all these things. One should keep completely

205
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,710
detached about it. Because for one day or
two day, or for say about a year people will

206
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:45,760
come to you, “Get this man cured, that man
cured.” And then you will find that you

207
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,750
have found nothing, they were all bubbles,
all lost and completely vanished into thin

208
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:58,190
air!
So, do not cure anyone. If you have to cure

209
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:03,720
people, then you please give them the photograph
and ask them to work on them. You have got

210
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,130
power to handle My photograph and give it
to others. You have lots of powers which normally

211
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,200
common people don’t have because I do not
tell them many things that I tell you. And

212
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:26,380
thus you are a person of a very rare quality
and a rare blessing.

213
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,500
Now write it down how many powers you have
got, go home, and you will write one complete

214
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,030
book! Take it from Me.
May God bless you all.

215
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:44,320
Try to preserve all your powers. Respect yourself.
You are a lamp that is burning a light which

216
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:54,330
enlightens others in their mind. It’s a
very great thing: even one person like that

217
00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:02,520
who was born among millions and billions of
people, and now here we have so many of you.

218
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,930
But quality-wise if you don’t rise it’s
going to be a hopeless case. So you must improve

219
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:15,780
your quality. All of you must improve your
quality, individually. Not criticising others,

220
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:22,380
not looking at others, but individually you
should understand your capacities and how

221
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:31,700
much you have given to others, and how much
you have really manifested out of what you

222
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,430
have got.
You have control over the sun, over the moon,

223
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:43,270
over the tides, and over the sea and all those
things – you have. But for that you have

224
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:47,520
to do a little more, which I’ll tell you
some other time. Now I don’t want you to

225
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,960
control all these things, and sit down on
top of a hillock and start showing off! Better

226
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,730
thing is you work it out first on human beings
and then I’ll give you all these, I’ll

227
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,510
tell you. You already have them awakened,
but I haven’t told you the trick, how to

228
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:10,660
do it. So best keep it to Myself.

229
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,500
May God bless you all.
