00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:26,208
Sankranti Puja, Rahuri, India

2
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:37,417
January 14th, 1987

3
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:30,666
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

4
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:40,997
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

5
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:45,421
towards the tropic of cancer.

6
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:56,630
Tropic of cancer is the one

7
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,339
which represents the motherhood,

8
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:15,005
the motherhood of the Earth.

9
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:28,380
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

10
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,380
quite a big area of land

11
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:37,089
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

12
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:43,047
And the area through which it has passed

13
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,297
it has created

14
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:58,755
different beautiful manifestation

15
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:05,339
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

16
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:11,089
We celebrate this change

17
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,047
because the Sun has now moved into the new

18
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:26,588
dimension so that all over the world

19
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:35,214
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

20
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,630
Warmth of the Sun

21
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:48,297
represents the warmth of God's love.

22
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:53,713
This is the reason why we celebrate

23
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:59,505
this festival

24
00:04:00,963 --> 00:04:03,380
by giving you some sort of a sweet

25
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:06,797
made out of sesame seeds.

26
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:16,546
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

27
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:21,797
and now as we are coming from the cold,

28
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:28,380
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

29
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:34,339
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

30
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,588
These special things are made out of the seed

31
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:46,755
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

32
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,089
and the warm of the Sun.

33
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:57,505
Though in India the heat is too much,

34
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:04,963
still people are waiting for this time to come in

35
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,379
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

36
00:05:09,838 --> 00:05:14,380
At this time it is said that

37
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:23,671
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

38
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:28,339
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

39
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:33,505
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

40
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:39,130
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

41
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:44,463
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

42
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:50,130
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

43
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:57,380
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

44
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:04,047
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

45
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,379
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

46
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:14,505
but not as companions, as friends.

47
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,047
To speak in a very sweet manner

48
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:28,880
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

49
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,421
Those who fear God will never speak

50
00:06:32,963 --> 00:06:36,214
rudely to another person, because in another person

51
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,671
also the same spirit is shining

52
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:45,130
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

53
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:50,838
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

54
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:56,963
So this loving, beautiful relationship

55
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:58,713
that we have with each other,

56
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:00,880
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

57
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,047
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

58
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:10,421
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

59
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,214
There are little, little things if you do,

60
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,755
you can create lot of sweetness,

61
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:26,505
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

62
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,755
I try these things many a times.

63
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:35,880
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

64
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:39,380
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

65
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,630
was going in the car with Me

66
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:51,588
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

67
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,047
and he got very angry with the driver.

68
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,379
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

69
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:02,671
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

70
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:05,380
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

71
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:07,922
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

72
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,755
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

73
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:15,630
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

74
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,214
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

75
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,463
same knife for him.

76
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:24,172
When I came, when I gave him,

77
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,089
he didn't have words to say anything.

78
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:29,463
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

79
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,380
After such a long time how did you manage

80
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:33,421
to get this knife?"

81
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,339
I said, "I have a very good memory."

82
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:38,713
That's the trouble with Me.

83
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:42,463
The memory is so good that sometimes,

84
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,755
I just don't know,

85
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,214
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

86
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:53,379
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

87
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,588
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

88
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:59,421
because no use remembering bad things,

89
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,005
no use thinking of them.

90
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,630
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

91
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,089
And if you remember the good things

92
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,797
your joy becomes multiplied.

93
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,339
If you try to remember something bad

94
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:17,297
then your joy goes down.

95
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:19,421
Every time you see a person try to remember

96
00:09:19,963 --> 00:09:22,922
what good that person has done to you.

97
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,380
What good that person has.

98
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:28,463
If you have memory for good things

99
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,214
you will have a very nice time.

100
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:37,379
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

101
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:40,047
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

102
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,463
Whatever it is,

103
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,339
I have to tell you one thing, that

104
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:50,755
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

105
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,755
to give you joy and happiness.

106
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,505
Now when you are going back,

107
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,421
try to remember all that was said to you.

108
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,380
All that was nice.

109
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,297
How people praised you.

110
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:06,880
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

111
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,339
How you met some nice people.

112
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,797
What nice experiences you had

113
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:15,880
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

114
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:19,505
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

115
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

116
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,880
just forget it.

117
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,797
Try to understand that you are spoiling

118
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:29,671
your chances of enjoying life.

119
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:37,922
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

120
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,297
that you have met so many people,

121
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,255
that you have had weddings,

122
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,297
that you have seen so many weddings.

123
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:48,505
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

124
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,047
full of joyous vibrations.

125
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,089
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

126
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:59,130
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

127
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,797
somebody's husbands are going away or

128
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,755
somebody's wives are going away.

129
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:05,255
So I can see some of them

130
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,005
are looking rather miserable about it.

131
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:17,255
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

132
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,047
and out of attraction for each other,

133
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,838
for enjoying the company of each other.

134
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,463
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

135
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,339
but still I would say that, after all,

136
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:31,755
you are going to meet each other

137
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,379
and remember all the good things that

138
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,463
you have said to each other,

139
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,963
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

140
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:42,214
Because these days will pass very fast.

141
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,671
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

142
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,463
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

143
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:52,797
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

144
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,505
whatever may be the case.

145
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,297
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

146
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:00,630
and to keep smiling and laughing,

147
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,297
so when they are departing also,

148
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:06,297
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

149
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:13,379
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

150
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:16,130
that the hope is there,

151
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:17,838
we are going to meet very soon and

152
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,713
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

153
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,713
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

154
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:30,713
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

155
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:35,130
The Sun has come back in His own glory

156
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:41,214
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

157
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,421
because in this part of Maharashtra

158
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,713
as you know there has been no rain.

159
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,089
There has been problems with them and

160
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,713
we have to wish Him success

161
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:55,421
so that He can bring forth the rain

162
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,339
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

163
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:05,089
that we have in this country.

164
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,297
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

165
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,339
when you go back to your countries.

166
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,297
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

167
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:20,005
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

168
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:23,838
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

169
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,880
we have the Sun with us.

170
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,797
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

171
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:35,089
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

172
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:38,005
has been brought from India by you.

173
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,463
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

174
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,421
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

175
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,630
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

176
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,880
they carry the Sun with them.

177
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,255
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

178
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:54,089
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

179
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:56,505
That must be the reason that's why

180
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,089
the Sun was shining so well

181
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,214
and everybody came out with their good dresses

182
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,379
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

183
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,713
So this is what it is,

184
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:07,005
that you have to carry the Sun with you

185
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:11,005
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

186
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,130
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

187
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,172
because you are yogis,

188
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,755
you are not ordinary people.

189
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,214
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

190
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:23,089
who are known for their righteousness,

191
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,214
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

192
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,297
So I wish you all best of luck.

193
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,922
Enjoy your journeys,

194
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:34,130
enjoy everything and pass this joy

195
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,797
that you have achieved here,

196
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,922
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

197
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,379
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

198
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,130
May God bless you with that.

199
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,380
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

200
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,380
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

201
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,255
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

202
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:56,505
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

203
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,339
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

204
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,047
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

205
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,463
With this habit of ours have created

206
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:09,546
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

207
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:14,463
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

208
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,005
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

209
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,588
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

210
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,005
In this country there are different types of germs

211
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,172
and parasites.

212
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,380
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

213
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:33,214
in this country. We even have parasites which

214
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:36,089
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

215
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,838
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

216
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,380
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

217
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:45,546
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

218
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:49,172
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

219
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,421
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

220
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:56,172
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

221
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,755
alive but live with joy and happiness,

222
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,380
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

223
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,463
The reason for this is the Sun.

224
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,463
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

225
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,713
and also open our hearts.

226
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,838
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

227
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:16,505
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

228
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,505
on the right clothes.

229
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,922
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

230
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:25,339
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

231
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,005
This is the situation there.

232
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,463
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

233
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,963
like this in England or in any other Western country.

234
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:38,630
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

235
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:44,505
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

236
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,713
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

237
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:54,588
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

238
00:16:55,505 --> 00:17:00,214
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

239
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:06,047
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

240
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,380
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

241
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:10,922
can survive.

242
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:15,671
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

243
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,630
They call it a valley of flowers.

244
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:22,005
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

245
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,713
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

246
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:28,047
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

247
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,214
to see that beautiful place.

248
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,588
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

249
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:35,505
because of the cold.

250
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,089
But in spite of the cold,

251
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,963
those countries have progressed so much.

252
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:45,880
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

253
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,797
and strengthened their countries.

254
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,797
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

255
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,713
to exploit its advantages.

256
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,047
We can also produce solar energy.

257
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,838
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

258
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:04,755
of (electrical) energy.

259
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,047
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

260
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,089
But the attention of the politicians here in India

261
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,463
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

262
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,880
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

263
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:19,297
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

264
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,380
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

265
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:25,214
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

266
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:29,421
It does not take anything but always gives.

267
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,463
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

268
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,047
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

269
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:39,546
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

270
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:41,421
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

271
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:44,297
we have been able to reach this state.

272
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,630
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

273
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:48,797
also develop the power of giving.

274
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,922
If we look around us we will find people who will always

275
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,838
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

276
00:18:54,214 --> 00:18:56,671
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

277
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:59,047
think how they can save money from that also.

278
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,922
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

279
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:05,380
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

280
00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:07,588
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

281
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,922
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

282
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,838
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

283
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:14,130
“Because the others have increased the prices,

284
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:15,630
that’s why I also increase the price.”

285
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:18,297
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

286
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,297
why do they raise the (selling) price?

287
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:25,380
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

288
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:28,172
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

289
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,463
occasion, then others tell Me,

290
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,214
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

291
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,797
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

292
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:48,255
they will eat (grab) money.

293
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:51,546
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

294
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,380
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

295
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,463
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

296
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,005
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

297
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:02,255
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

298
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:05,797
we have to give.

299
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:10,380
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

300
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,421
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

301
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,130
This complete change from within has to be reached with

302
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,130
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

303
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,671
We have to have the passion of giving.

304
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:25,005
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

305
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,963
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

306
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,047
what food can I cook for him?”

307
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,588
This is the passion which a mother has.

308
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,671
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

309
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:38,797
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

310
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,546
She always feel that she has not done enough.

311
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,922
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

312
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:48,089
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

313
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,546
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

314
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:54,755
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

315
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,339
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

316
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,505
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

317
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:02,339
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

318
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:05,505
to achieve anything in this country.

319
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:09,671
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

320
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,546
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

321
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,797
But the lake was never built.

322
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,380
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

323
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,255
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

324
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:23,130
But in fact the hole was never dug.

325
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,838
So where did the money go?

326
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,922
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

327
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,671
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

328
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,421
the money again to Switzerland.

329
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,421
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

330
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:35,214
even for one day.

331
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,755
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

332
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,005
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

333
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:47,463
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

334
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,380
we acquire the habit of giving.

335
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:53,713
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

336
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:57,005
but most of the people believe in donating something

337
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,713
to the priest.

338
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,713
Also, many people preach the art of giving

339
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:06,047
just to fill their own pockets.

340
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,255
This doesn’t have any meaning.

341
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:13,255
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

342
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:16,172
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

343
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:19,130
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

344
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,880
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

345
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:26,963
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

346
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,421
so that we get all the joy of giving.

347
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:34,588
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

348
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:38,963
cannot be compared with any other joy.

349
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:42,130
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

350
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:47,463
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

351
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,838
Our nature should become like the Sun.

352
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:58,130
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

353
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:02,379
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

354
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,379
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

355
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:08,963
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

356
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,089
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

357
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:17,255
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

358
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,421
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

359
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,214
his qualities of giving.

360
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:23,797
I told you a very small thing:

361
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:26,922
that every Sahaja yogi

362
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:30,505
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

363
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:32,380
Why do we have to take money from the government

364
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,255
for this purpose?

365
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:35,922
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

366
00:23:36,255 --> 00:23:37,963
tree doesn’t need much money.

367
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:39,671
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

368
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,047
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

369
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,922
you are at least doing something.

370
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:46,380
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

371
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:48,671
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

372
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,297
save money at others cost.

373
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,880
Because of these tendencies within us,

374
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,755
our country can never progress.

375
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,505
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

376
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,130
in the earlier days.

377
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:06,089
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

378
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,671
believed only in giving and never in taking.

379
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,297
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

380
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,421
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

381
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:20,505
something from others and would tell them to return it.

382
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,588
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

383
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,546
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

384
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,047
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

385
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,546
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

386
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,838
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

387
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:34,630
it would be better that we have them with us once

388
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,588
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

389
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,630
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

390
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,255
who had borrowed had not returned them.

391
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:41,922
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

392
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:43,838
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

393
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,297
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

394
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,130
we should invest it into something collective.

395
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:48,671
If you want to construct a badminton court,

396
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,089
then in that court everybody should be able to come

397
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,546
and play and we should not say that only my children

398
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,463
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

399
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:56,005
we should be able to take all the children to school.

400
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,713
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

401
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,671
can be taken to school.

402
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,838
This habit of being collective and being useful

403
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,130
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

404
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,379
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

405
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:11,089
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

406
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,713
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

407
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,671
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

408
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,630
for the common public.

409
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:22,379
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

410
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,130
do anything for the common people.

411
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:27,838
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

412
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,922
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

413
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,671
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

414
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,505
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

415
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,630
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

416
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:43,130
it will be useful to everybody.

417
00:25:43,797 --> 00:25:46,421
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

418
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,297
and make money out of it.

419
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,671
It should not happen like the way we give money

420
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:52,380
to the priest.

421
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,963
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

422
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:56,963
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

423
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:59,755
One should make it a habit.

424
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:01,922
I do not want to say that others should have

425
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,214
everything for free.

426
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:06,339
I never said that you do something for free for

427
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,671
the people who have come from abroad.

428
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,630
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

429
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,005
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

430
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,755
Of course I have contributed a lot.

431
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,089
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

432
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,255
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

433
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:25,214
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

434
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:27,339
but then they told Me that these were the presents

435
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,797
which they bought themselves and they had not

436
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,089
brought My presents.

437
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,546
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

438
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,005
for you.

439
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:39,047
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

440
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,421
to be given but they do not bother.

441
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,463
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

442
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:45,505
here in India.

443
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,130
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

444
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:50,838
our children and about our mother.

445
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:53,339
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

446
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:56,130
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

447
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,214
a high quality sari.”

448
00:26:58,588 --> 00:27:01,963
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

449
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,880
This is the tendency here.

450
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:07,505
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

451
00:27:07,797 --> 00:27:09,922
When they came here they came with so many presents

452
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:13,089
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

453
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,546
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

454
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:17,797
two tons of presents.

455
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:21,047
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

456
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:23,339
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

457
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:25,963
an example for them. And you should show them that

458
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:28,380
you are in no way inferior to them,

459
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,838
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

460
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,463
whatever is possible from our side

461
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:34,380
we do not hesitate to do.”

462
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:36,421
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

463
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,297
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

464
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,214
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

465
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,089
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

466
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,713
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

467
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:48,963
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

468
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,463
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

469
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,421
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

470
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,630
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

471
00:27:56,172 --> 00:27:58,005
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

472
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:01,005
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

473
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:02,963
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

474
00:28:03,255 --> 00:28:05,588
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

475
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,380
from them or to plunder anybody.

476
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,505
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

477
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,588
of plundering them comes from.

478
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:16,546
This is a very strange behavior.

479
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,755
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

480
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,047
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

481
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:23,339
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

482
00:28:23,588 --> 00:28:25,172
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

483
00:28:25,546 --> 00:28:27,089
(association for the welfare of women).

484
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,379
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

485
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,172
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

486
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,755
this organization.

487
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,922
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

488
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,463
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

489
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:39,505
find anybody to work for this organization.

490
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,463
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

491
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,755
organization only then it will succeed.

492
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,922
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

493
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:49,588
find time to devote for this organization.

494
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:51,797
So how can we go to this place?

495
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,588
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

496
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:55,505
with the money to donate for your organization.

497
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,130
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

498
00:28:57,922 --> 00:29:00,005
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

499
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:02,255
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

500
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,963
something out of it. And they can prosper.

501
00:29:04,963 --> 00:29:07,421
At least these things we should try to think about.

502
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:09,421
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

503
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:11,255
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

504
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:13,339
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

505
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:15,963
We should think in terms of global advantage.

506
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,172
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

507
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,838
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

508
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:21,380
this world exists.

509
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:23,880
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

510
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:27,421
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

511
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:31,255
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

512
00:29:31,588 --> 00:29:33,797
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

513
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:37,130
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

514
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,922
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

515
00:29:41,297 --> 00:29:43,172
Thus from our side we should always think how much

516
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,172
we can give and what we can give,

517
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:49,838
how much love we can give.

518
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:51,797
And how many people we can help.

519
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:53,922
All our attention should be for this purpose.

520
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:56,588
Nowadays there are welfare associations

521
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,421
just for election purposes.

522
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,797
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

523
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,588
But we should create associations in which we can

524
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:06,880
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

525
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,880
and we should not expect anything in return.

526
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:12,463
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

527
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:14,922
When we have this kind of love automatically

528
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,214
we will know what is to be done.

529
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:18,963
The improvements should be done gradually and every

530
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,797
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

531
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:24,005
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

532
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:26,047
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

533
00:30:26,463 --> 00:30:28,797
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

534
00:30:28,797 --> 00:30:30,922
and when She goes everything is finished.”

535
00:30:30,922 --> 00:30:32,922
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

536
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:35,379
They have started schools and social welfare.

537
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,505
We should also start something in this manner.

538
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,755
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

539
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,379
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

540
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,380
but are lazy lumps.

541
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,089
It should not happen this way.

542
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:52,339
We should try to see how we can help others.

543
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:55,255
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

544
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,588
and try to see how we can help others.

545
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:02,214
Still I have not been able to move to India.

546
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:04,671
Once I come back to India you will see that

547
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,214
I will make everyone work.

548
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,339
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

549
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,838
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

550
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:13,713
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

551
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,713
You can go the Himalayas.

552
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,797
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

553
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:20,089
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

554
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,671
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

555
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:24,505
modern welfare organizations.

556
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,214
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

557
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,797
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

558
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,713
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

559
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:37,089
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

560
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,047
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

561
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,963
But you should remember one thing – you should work

562
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:44,838
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

563
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,797
yourself in the mirror.

564
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,255
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

565
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,379
like in the earlier days you used to look after

566
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,755
your household, your children. In the same manner,

567
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:56,339
if you are not able to work for the collective,

568
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,505
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

569
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:00,797
through Sahaja Yoga.

570
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,089
You have remained where you were,

571
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,380
you have not progressed at all.

572
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,838
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

573
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:12,379
how many banyan trees you have planted.

574
00:32:12,922 --> 00:32:16,421
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

575
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,546
or social work you have done.

576
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,130
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

577
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:23,671
to see some collective work which you can do

578
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:25,922
and you should do.

579
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:28,505
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

580
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:30,797
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

581
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:32,755
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

582
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:34,713
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

583
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,005
and I started without any money.

584
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,671
I did not have support from anybody but even then

585
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,797
I started Sahaja Yoga.

586
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,380
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

587
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,797
it has spread so much.

588
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:49,297
Now each one of you, man or woman,

589
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:52,379
you have the responsibility that when you will

590
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,172
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

591
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,630
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

592
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,214
well being. You need not break any law for this.

593
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,880
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

594
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:09,047
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

595
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,713
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

596
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,797
for the general welfare of the people,

597
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:16,130
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

598
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:18,630
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

599
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,546
to do this work.

600
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,797
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

601
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:24,755
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

602
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,005
anything in return you will start working for

603
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,880
the welfare of the people.

604
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:32,380
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

605
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,005
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

606
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:37,005
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

607
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:39,630
First you should start some work which does not need money.

608
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,880
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

609
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,172
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

610
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:47,838
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

611
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:52,005
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

612
00:33:53,713 --> 00:33:54,922
Instead of that, what I see is that

613
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:56,713
you bring the sick person to Me.

614
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,421
The other day, someone brought

615
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:00,214
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

616
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,214
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

617
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:04,214
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

618
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:05,713
and that too right in the middle of a public program

619
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:07,505
and asked Me to treat his arm.

620
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,172
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

621
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,463
through your hands but still you do not use them.

622
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:15,505
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

623
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:20,379
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

624
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:23,880
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

625
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:29,005
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

626
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,463
You do have the powers, try to use them.

627
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:35,130
Thus you should be able to help the people without

628
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:39,214
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

629
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,505
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

630
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,630
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

631
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,963
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

632
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:55,379
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

633
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:58,463
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

634
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:00,339
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

635
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:03,755
then, you will be able to do something for others

636
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,546
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

637
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,379
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

638
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:14,421
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

639
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,172
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

640
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:19,546
are just sitting in meditation.

641
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:21,797
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

642
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,838
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

643
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,005
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

644
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:28,339
First she should cook, for meditation even

645
00:35:28,588 --> 00:35:30,546
five minutes are sufficient.

646
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:33,047
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

647
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,130
Thus one should have the confidence

648
00:35:37,713 --> 00:35:41,047
that you are capable of work.

649
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,546
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

650
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,047
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

651
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:48,379
You have to see what wellbeing you are

652
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,380
giving to the others.

653
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:55,130
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

654
00:35:55,379 --> 00:35:57,047
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

655
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:58,838
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

656
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,255
And you want that I should also come to your house

657
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,421
to eat, do this, do that.

658
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,630
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

659
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,421
but about you, what can you do?

660
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,546
You should always remember that you have to do something.

661
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,505
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

662
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,630
to do something special.”

663
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,089
We should decide this once and for all.

664
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:23,546
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

665
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:30,047
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

666
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,588
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

667
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:40,297
Where is it? I want to see it.

668
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,379
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

669
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,630
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

670
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,546
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

671
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,505
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

672
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,838
full of love.

673
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:22,713
He is saying you should put your hands

674
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:26,130
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

675
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,380
And we will try to do good to others and

676
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:33,047
we will be very kind to each other.

677
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,671
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

678
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:44,463
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

679
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:47,089
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

680
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:52,713
how we can help. We have many social obligations

681
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:54,838
which we have to fulfill.

682
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:57,963
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

683
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:03,922
without forming any social organization which collects money

684
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,838
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

685
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:11,255
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

686
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:13,797
to whom you can help.

687
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:16,339
And that is how you can really give

688
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:20,380
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

689
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,172
Marathi

690
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:58,047
Rahurila

691
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:26,463
I'll be giving this water to all of you

692
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:32,339
all the leaders and aslo..

693
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,922
you can take it.

694
00:48:35,755 --> 00:48:37,214
this water is very good for

695
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:42,546
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
