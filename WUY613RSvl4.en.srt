1
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:54,135
Today is a very important day in our lives
as Sahaja Yogis.

2
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:59,242
This is the day when Sahasrara was
opened out,

3
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:06,683
which was really a very charismatic thing
that happened.

4
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:10,106
I never expected

5
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:16,212
that in my lifetime I’d be able to work
it out, but has been.

6
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:23,168
And so many of you have got your
Sahasrara opened.

7
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:31,099
Without that, you could never have known
what is the truth.

8
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:37,033
You were all lost, as everybody is.

9
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:47,001
First of all, Sahasrara is the only way
we can perceive,

10
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:53,589
understand and know the reality.

11
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:03,418
You have come to know as to what is
the reality.

12
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:10,707
and you’re enjoying that state where you
know

13
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:14,382
what is the reality.

14
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:23,188
It’s a great blessing that Sahasrara was
opened out

15
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:27,691
and all of you got your Realization.

16
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:31,168
Otherwise, all talks are just talks,

17
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:35,601
has no meaning, has no understanding

18
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:42,904
and that’s why my first anxiety was
to open Sahasrara.

19
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,375
That worked out, worked out well

20
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:52,701
and all of you have got your Sahasrara
opened.

21
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:57,253
It’s a remarkable thing. Nobody can believe

22
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,895
that so many of you have got your
Sahasrara opened,

23
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:09,847
but I can see now clearly the light
on top of your heads.

24
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:15,186
Whatever you have achieved is remarkable,
no doubt.

25
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:24,091
It is because of honest searching, honest
searching, that you have got it.

26
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:29,286
My doing is nothing because you were
just there

27
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:35,243
like a lamp and I just enlightened it,
that’s all.

28
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,055
It’s not such a big thing to do.

29
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:47,671
As you people have achieved your state,
state of enlightenment,

30
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:54,025
that you got it because you were
hankering after it,

31
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,755
working it out and you did it!

32
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:03,724
It’s very creditable. Credit doesn’t go
to me, I think,

33
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:07,371
because I had an open Sahasrara,

34
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:15,900
but to achieve that in you people was
so joy-giving for me.

35
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:21,030
Now you will understand because if
Sahasrara is not open,

36
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:25,446
you can’t talk [to] people, you can’t say
anything to them.

37
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:29,387
It’s just they don’t understand.

38
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:34,611
With the Sahasrara open, your understanding
improves so much.

39
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:38,162
That is what has happened with all of you.

40
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:44,096
And I’m so very happy that it’s so many
people there are sitting here

41
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:49,810
who have got their Sahasraras open and
there are many who have not come.

42
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:55,900
So it’s a big achievement for human beings

43
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:02,336
to get it so much collectively, Sahasrara
opened,

44
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:09,959
by which you know the truth, absolute
truth.

45
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,257
Whatever you know after your Realization
is the absolute truth.

46
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:20,628
You don’t argue then, don’t question,

47
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:26,905
you just know it and you accept it as
a knowledge.

48
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:33,541
It’s such a nice thing that it was all
there, but it was not open.

49
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:38,898
And when it opened out, how people have
understood me

50
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,531
and also the laws of the Divine.

51
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:45,644
It’s such a blessing of the Divine

52
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:49,556
that you have got your Sahasrara
opened out,

53
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:53,994
for which you may say, “We didn’t do
anything, Mother.”

54
00:11:54,195 --> 00:12:03,173
It’s not so. Your search for truth was
intense and definite.

55
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:08,298
You wanted to know the truth. That’s why
it has worked out.

56
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,781
Otherwise no amount of money,

57
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,638
no amount of effort, nothing would have
helped.

58
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,356
Sahasrara had to open by itself.

59
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:23,197
It’s all your building up, I should say.

60
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:27,729
It’s all your doing, yourself,

61
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,022
that has brought forth such a beautiful
happening.

62
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:41,605
I do not take any credit for that – at all.

63
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:48,065
Definitely, I must say, that I have made
you understand

64
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:52,962
that it’s important that your Sahasrara
should be opened.

65
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:58,364
No more arguments, no more suggestions,
nothing,

66
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:05,789
but have your own Sahasrara open, which
tells you what is the truth.

67
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:13,180
In these beautiful circumstances, what
could your Mother say?

68
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:16,378
I can only say that continue to live

69
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,483
a life of reality, of understanding.

70
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:25,958
In everything you will find there is truth.

71
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:35,889
And how do we use that truth is our
own achievement.

72
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:43,994
People are lost because they have no
knowledge.

73
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:48,817
Knowledge from the books is no knowledge.

74
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:53,433
Their knowledge must come from within,
from within themselves

75
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:58,864
and that has happened because of Sahasrara
opening.

76
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:04,866
In all the countries it has happened, and
it will be in the whole world;

77
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:08,319
so many people will get Realization.

78
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,599
But only thing, I feel that you people
should have

79
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,720
no emotional attachment to it – not
emotional,

80
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:28,670
but realistic attachment, that it is there,
it has happened, it’s working out.

81
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:33,252
Then you will be able to give Realizations
to others,

82
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:37,110
you’ll understand the importance
of Realization.

83
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:43,550
Unless and until you use it, you won’t know
what is the power of Realization is.

84
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:49,333
So you must learn how to use this power
which is within you,

85
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:57,610
which has started working out and which
will give you such an immense capacity.

86
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:04,927
My health is little bit gone down,
after all, I am very old.

87
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:11,491
But still I don’t feel tired in any way
while addressing you.

88
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:17,350
I feel so enamoured that there are so many
Sahaja Yogis,

89
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:23,324
so many whose Sahasrara is opened and
they’re enjoying their Sahasrara.

90
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:27,047
Actually I would have liked you to ask me
questions,

91
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:32,336
but you can write questions and send me
written ones.

92
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:38,662
Then I’ll try to answer them some time.
Will be a much better idea.

93
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:43,365
So thank you very much. May God bless you.

94
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:48,514
Grow into Sahaj, grow into you being.

95
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:53,456
May God bless you. All my blessings.
