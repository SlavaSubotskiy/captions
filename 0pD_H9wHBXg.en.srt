1
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:53,396
So lever should be treated.

2
00:17:53,396 --> 00:18:00,977
And next time when you come to India we are
going to get you all the medicines of liver.

3
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,826
If they are very fat then they are left sided.

4
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:11,657
Try to bring them to the center with the three
candle treatment.

5
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,936
But first of all test it what is the situation.

6
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,367
Sometime they developed the puffy fat that
is alright.

7
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,167
They will become alright.

8
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,467
That is how you should look after their health.

9
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:26,657
Then also look after their behavior.

10
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:30,427
Tell them how to behave.

11
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:36,417
So I have seen in west the children are not
properly brought up because parents neglect

12
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,417
them.

13
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,667
I want blame the children.

14
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:44,417
Parents neglect them it should be loving,
kind and at the same time you should must

15
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:46,227
tell them what is discipline is.

16
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:50,456
It is very important.

17
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,947
Then Keep a watch on them.

18
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:54,247
How they are?

19
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,547
What they are doing?

20
00:18:56,547 --> 00:19:00,997
Of course we have school but it has limited
seats there.

21
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:08,387
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust as
a many as possible.

22
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:14,687
Even then supposing you have any problem,
do not go arbitrarily in to it.

23
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:23,877
You many ask your leader or you may write
to me and inform me.

24
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:30,617
Among you somebody might become very ego oriented,
may start his own organization, I will do

25
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,617
this.

26
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:35,087
Let him say you get out and he will suffer.

27
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:37,517
You do not have to worry.

28
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,327
Alright you get out.

29
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:41,517
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

30
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:47,097
Suppose one finger start working more than
other means it is cancer that is malignancy.

31
00:19:47,097 --> 00:19:49,887
We can not have malignancy.

32
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:56,947
All of you should work together with understanding,
before others as well among yourselves.

33
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,497
It is very important to understand.

34
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:04,667
Now, Sahajayoga has worked out in so many
countries.

35
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:09,987
In such a big way in some and in such a small
way in some.

36
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:17,687
But wherever, Sahajayogi have to be something
special.

37
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:23,907
Even the Children have to be something special.

38
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:29,018
You have any other problems which do not want
to discuss, you say with your leader and then

39
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:32,407
you can write to me directly, no harm.

40
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:36,907
Either If I answer well and good and if I
do not answer also well and good, it will

41
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:38,597
work out.

42
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:45,687
But attention should not be all the time about
yourself.

43
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:50,707
Me, my family, my children, my house, my job,
No.

44
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:56,467
As soon as your attention on another people
it works fast.

45
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,617
It helps, very much.

46
00:20:57,617 --> 00:21:03,137
But on your self, I am sick; I have this problem
that problem, nothing.

47
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:11,857
You are now at the stage when you can absolutely
solve all the problem but first and foremost

48
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:16,797
thing is if your attention on yourself it
want work out.

49
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,397
Attention should be on others.

50
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:28,057
And if it has to be on yourself, attention
then just find what is wrong with me.

51
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:31,147
But some people in that also go too far.

52
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:36,917
Mother my Agyna is caching, Mother my this
is caching, it is nonsense.

53
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:42,677
May be you are caching from other people,
possible.

54
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:50,967
There are some nice books, now already in
Sahajayoga translated in Chinese luckily and

55
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:55,507
also my tapes could be translated also.

56
00:21:55,507 --> 00:22:01,207
But you have to keep my voice as I told you
because that is mantra, isn't it?

57
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:06,596
And you can have subtitle would be better
if you could do it.

58
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:12,247
That is a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

59
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:18,867
Specially, for Russian if they could do in
Russia.

60
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:44,437
Now if you have any question you can ask me.

61
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:50,707
So it should be always like, if you are Chinese,
then you should not only deal with Chinese.

62
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:53,247
They should all come to the collective.

63
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:57,137
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians, but they should

64
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:59,077
come to the collective.

65
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:03,327
Because unless and until they come to the
collective they will not know what the problem

66
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:04,327
is?

67
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:09,217
It is not that you can organize separately
a group, another group separately.

68
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,917
It has to be one group.

69
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:18,247
Of course you could have two ashrams or three
ashrams, makes no difference.

70
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:21,156
Any other question?

71
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,497
Sahajayogi: is the Camphor treatment is for
left side?

72
00:23:23,497 --> 00:23:24,497
Shri Mataji: What?

73
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:25,497
Sahajayogi: camphor treatment?

74
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:26,497
The Camphor treatment?

75
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:27,497
Shri Mataji: What?

76
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:34,127
Sahajayogi: he is asking if the camphor treatment
is good for left side.

77
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:35,397
Shri Mataji: what?

78
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,007
Shri Mataji: No no no no.

79
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:38,007
No need.

80
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,907
Camphor, only once in a while.

81
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,447
Do not do camphor.

82
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:44,327
But you have done all mixed up thing, you
see.

83
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:49,747
Just do left side treatment and you will be
alright, just mixed up.

84
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:56,757
And you can not earn money on the name of
GOD or divine work that is one thing.

85
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:58,857
You can not organize like that.

86
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:00,477
No Never.

87
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:04,517
Because once you start getting like this left
sided Bhoot will come into it.

88
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,737
That is the part of Sahajayog.

89
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:11,097
We can not.

90
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:19,597
Also if you have any guru's photograph and
all that it is better to put them in the sea.

91
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:26,007
Because this keeping any photograph, any book
about them creates problems.

92
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:31,447
So religiously search out and put them in
the sea.

93
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:37,338
[Shri Mataji looked at something]
"No no no no no no no"."

94
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:39,407
No no no" Don't do all that.

95
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:42,067
They will work on the photograph.

96
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:47,687
If you want to help somebody, you see some
other people who have come, who want to raise,

97
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:49,987
do not touch them.

98
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:55,667
Take a bandhan yourself and give them a bandhan.

99
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:59,497
Put them before the photograph and you just
raise the Kundalini.

100
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,517
But be careful.

101
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:10,107
Because you are still, you see, not that sort
of thing that you cannot catch.

102
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,507
You Might catch.

103
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:16,257
So Among yourselves also you should not do
that.

104
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,287
Do not touch.

105
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:21,126
If somebody says I have this problem alright.

106
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:24,417
Put him on the photograph.

107
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,487
Take a bandhan yourself.

108
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,686
Ask them to take a bandhan.

109
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:34,067
You also give a bandhan and then raise the
Kundalini.

110
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:37,267
Be careful.

111
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:42,567
Even if there is somebody who has came now,
who is sick man.

112
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:48,156
So you can give them a photograph, it is alright
if they are willing to do it.

113
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:56,817
But somebody in his family is willing to take
Sahajayoga, who is a healthy person he should

114
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:58,087
bring.

115
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,287
Otherwise don't get after sick person.

116
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:03,697
You will have many sick, in thousand, to begin
with.

117
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:09,167
Do not worry about sick.

118
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:15,876
If they are sick tell them to take the photograph
and work it out if they are left sided or

119
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,987
right sided.

120
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:19,557
Then the faith grows it improves.

121
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:22,537
But you do not touch the sick.

122
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:23,537
No no.

123
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:24,537
Not at all.

124
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:26,506
You are not here to cure sick.

125
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:30,616
But we are here to give realisation.

126
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:34,306
May God bless you.

127
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:46,527
Sahajayogi: For technique, if you have a problem
on one side, you have balance in left side

128
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:56,626
is weak [Not clear], Do you raise Kundalini
on this side and give bandhan to the other

129
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:57,626
side.

130
00:26:57,626 --> 00:27:09,397
Shri Mataji: Supposing you are right sided
then you have to put down the right side,

131
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:13,667
remember that way it is much much better.

132
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:19,967
Then you raise your left side and put on right
side if you have right side problem.

133
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:25,076
If you have left side problem so you have
to put down the left side.

134
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,576
It is easier to remember this way.

135
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:39,277
So there is no confusion.

136
00:27:39,277 --> 00:27:44,626
But tying of Kundalini you should be done
after you have moved out left to right or

137
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:51,326
right to left, which ever way and then raise
your Kundalini and tie up and take a bandhan,

138
00:27:51,326 --> 00:28:03,347
it is the best way.

139
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:10,856
I would request you all of you to take photograph
of yours and make an album, write it down

140
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:20,686
below that what is your name, date of birth
and of self realisation.

141
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:24,946
Send it over to me because I go on seeing
that sometimes.

142
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:32,238
So, I know you better and also I will allow
my attention on you, of children and as well

143
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:40,756
as of bigger people.

144
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:46,186
So I will talk to you and talk to him because
you have little individual problem, both of

145
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:47,186
you.

146
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,467
So what about you?

147
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:52,186
Are you reconcile?

148
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,426
Ha?

149
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:56,797
..I am going to get her.

150
00:28:56,797 --> 00:29:03,936
[Not clear] He came here to do Sahajayoga
and not to disturb a family.

151
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:05,707
He is been very wrong.

152
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:10,256
I am going to be very angry with him.

153
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:16,587
He is an old Sahajayogi, he should have behaved
himself.

154
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:23,006
[Not clear] You have such sweet beautiful
children.

155
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:26,756
I will never support you in nonsense, i must
tell you.

156
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:33,376
And your husband is very good man and if you
behave alright he will come round to Sahajayoga.

157
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:36,277
I am sure.

158
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:41,407
You can not be a Sahajayogi if you have no
dharma [Not clear].

159
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:42,407
"Shield".

160
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:43,407
As Buddha has called.

161
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:58,486
As we called As the Your character, your morality
is the most important in Sahajayoga.

162
00:29:58,486 --> 00:30:04,696
If you are not moral it has no meaning at
all.

163
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,366
What you need is morality.

164
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:10,237
This is happening everywhere, nonsense.

165
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:18,167
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we have
to generate it for others also.

166
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,506
Whole world is full of immoral people.

167
00:30:21,506 --> 00:30:26,576
Very very few who are standing for morality?

168
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:40,746
It was the greatest ornament we have, Alright?

169
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:42,097
Don't go after.

170
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:46,636
This will never help you?

171
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:52,056
It was very wrong of you and also for your
children.

172
00:30:52,056 --> 00:31:05,566
Now go back and behave yourself properly otherwise
you cannot be in Sahajayoga.

173
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:13,727
Ha, If there is something wrong then it is
alright.

174
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,016
We have divorce in Sahajayoga.

175
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:17,606
We allow divorce in Sahajayoga.

176
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:26,437
But there should be substantial reason for
that.

177
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:31,946
"Or to sub thik hai".

178
00:31:31,946 --> 00:31:34,496
What we do?

179
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:38,756
May God Bless you all.

180
00:31:38,756 --> 00:35:25,497
I am sorry you had to come so late in

181
00:35:25,497 --> 00:36:03,227
the night.
