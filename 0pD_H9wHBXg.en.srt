1
00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:05,492
All right. Put your hands towards Me.

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,321
First of all, I must say

3
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:21,644
I am very happy to see so many Sahaja
Yogis in Hong Kong.

4
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:29,170
Hong Kong is a very materialistic place,
as you know,

5
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,950
and people are too busy,

6
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:38,036
but the problems come out of that busyness.

7
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:42,151
All this busy life creates lots
of problems.

8
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:50,374
So I am sure there will be more coming
from the last program, definitely,

9
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:58,296
lots of them, and your hands will be full.

10
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:02,450
So I just wanted to tell you

11
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:10,832
what should we really do to achieve
the maximum results.

12
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:17,244
First of all, we have to establish

13
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:23,944
that we are Sahaja Yogis, we are very
sober people

14
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:33,499
and we have among ourselves tremendous
respect and love.

15
00:01:33,922 --> 00:01:37,086
So one should never support

16
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:43,163
an outsider who is not yet a Sahaja Yogi
or who will be a Sahaja Yogi

17
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:47,250
but support each other, all the time.

18
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:51,997
Do not argue among yourselves.

19
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:57,295
Maybe one person may be wrong, I am
not saying.

20
00:01:57,496 --> 00:02:04,285
But [it] is important that we should
support each other,

21
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:08,481
and above all, we must support the leader.

22
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:12,986
Whatever the leader says, we must listen
to him.

23
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:21,134
It’s very important, in Sahaja Yoga we are
a collective organisation,

24
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:25,420
that too a living organisation.

25
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:31,137
If somebody is not collective, he is thrown
out of Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,977
We are not very happy with such people.

27
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:38,187
So you must try to put

28
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:56,078
all effort to see that you are all
collectively one

29
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,685
and say the same thing.

30
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:05,867
This is very important to know.

31
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:12,502
Also there are people who may not be
so good among you

32
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:17,353
who can judge the vibrations, possibly.

33
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:21,996
If so, you should ask your leader.

34
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:25,651
But among yourselves you should never
argue, because we know

35
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:30,165
that Sahaja Yoga gives you absolute truth.

36
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:32,980
So others should not doubt

37
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:39,710
by your behaviour that these people don’t
know anything. All right?

38
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:46,753
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

39
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:50,395
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

40
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:54,204
Must understand what is divine love is.

41
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:59,045
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

42
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:08,339
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:19,386
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

44
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:27,534
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

45
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:32,710
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

46
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:38,422
So our love is not limited love.

47
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:42,752
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

48
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:52,180
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

49
00:04:52,381 --> 00:05:00,808
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

50
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,011
but at the same time, it is pure love.

51
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:14,651
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

52
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:26,805
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

53
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,967
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

54
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:35,329
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

55
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,600
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

56
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:45,098
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

57
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:53,019
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

58
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,644
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

59
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:06,146
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

60
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:10,960
your right hand towards the photograph

61
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:17,474
and the left hand up there.

62
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:23,997
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

63
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:30,098
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

64
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:36,184
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

65
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:43,470
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

66
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,181
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

67
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:53,384
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

68
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:58,222
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

69
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:04,355
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

70
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,822
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

71
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:12,162
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

72
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:15,132
With both the hands.

73
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:22,102
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

74
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:28,001
I am always available, so you can ask.

75
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:33,332
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

76
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:39,364
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

77
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:44,826
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

78
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:49,268
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

79
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,941
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

80
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:58,237
that “these are extraordinary people”.

81
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:07,088
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

82
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:14,315
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

83
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:17,830
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

84
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:22,287
and the women should deal only with women

85
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,519
and no complications should come out.

86
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,889
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

87
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,377
that they are just like ordinary people.

88
00:08:38,189 --> 00:08:42,632
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

89
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:47,512
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

90
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:50,777
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

91
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:55,004
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

92
00:08:55,205 --> 00:09:00,040
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

93
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:04,410
what sort of a personality you have.

94
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:07,985
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

95
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:11,045
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

96
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:17,320
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

97
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,982
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

98
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:24,185
They should not touch water.

99
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:30,565
Two types of treatments are there.

100
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:35,707
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

101
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:41,203
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

102
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:46,756
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

103
00:09:46,957 --> 00:09:53,209
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

104
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:58,437
and see for yourself how it is working out,

105
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,504
without water, without candle.

106
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:08,525
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

107
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:12,673
use candle as far as possible.

108
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:20,232
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

109
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,186
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

110
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:27,183
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

111
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:30,574
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

112
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:35,308
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

113
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:40,233
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

114
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:45,096
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

115
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:49,514
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

116
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:56,060
diabetes, blood cancer,

117
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:01,270
kidney coagulation,

118
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:06,986
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

119
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,174
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

120
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:23,655
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

121
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:31,043
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

122
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:38,156
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

123
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:47,258
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

124
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:51,318
But if you do your meditation every day,

125
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,235
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

126
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:59,335
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

127
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:03,296
and you keep good health.

128
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:07,072
That’s the only way you can grow.

129
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:15,585
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

130
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:23,391
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

131
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,978
That’s very important. And secondly,

132
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,770
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

133
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:38,615
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

134
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:44,969
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.

135
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:51,341
We have people in India and abroad

136
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:55,052
who have become such powerful Sahaja Yogis

137
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:59,668
that just by prayer they can achieve
lot of things.

138
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:05,403
We are not here to destroy anyone
or to torture anyone:

139
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:12,586
we are here to help everyone, to make
them joyous.

140
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:19,759
So one should not talk loudly, sharply,
never.

141
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:25,035
And show your compassion. Now supposing
somebody has some problem:

142
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:28,745
we should not suddenly say: “You are
a bhut”, no.

143
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:32,424
“What’s your problem? Oh, you are
left-sided”.

144
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,728
“What’s your problem? You are right-sided”.

145
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,375
“All right, it can be cured. I was like
this”. If you say, they won’t feel hurt.

146
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:44,586
“I was like you. You will be cured.
Don’t worry”.

147
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:51,099
So we have to understand that we have
to be extremely careful

148
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,345
as to what kind of words we are using,

149
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:03,776
and what kind of things we are doing
in their presence.

150
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:07,859
Some people are extremely fast, they will
walk fast

151
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,285
and they will be handling things with such
a funny gestures

152
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,060
that people will be frightened.

153
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,517
You should not be such.

154
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:29,718
What you have to do is to see that whatever
actions you take,

155
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,049
you talk to them or do, do it in a gentle
way;

156
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,611
that’s very important to be gentle and kind
to them.

157
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:46,418
Also you’ll get people who will have bhuts,
who will have gurus on their heads,

158
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,553
like the other day that lady was arguing
with Me.

159
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:53,353
Try to convince [them] and tell if the -

160
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,557
you know now who are real and who
are unreal.

161
00:14:56,758 --> 00:15:00,419
If you don’t know, ask your leader.

162
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:08,208
You better tell them that, “This is not
going to help you, it has not helped you,

163
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,200
so you have to give up.” And I’m sure
they’ll agree.

164
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:15,676
I’m very sure they’ll agree.

165
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:21,903
Because the way other day that Sindhi
lady, she was arguing with me.

166
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:25,069
And she said that, “We get Vibhutis
[Sacred ash] in all centers.”

167
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,619
I said: “This is all bhuta vidya, preta
vidya and smashana vidya.

168
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,571
What do you get out of the vibhuti that
comes in, what is so great?”

169
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:41,198
All these things are just to mislead you.

170
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:49,199
So tell them firmly, but with full
attention,

171
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,922
that you are trying to help them. If you
want to help them

172
00:15:56,123 --> 00:16:04,595
then you cannot afford to be rude to them
 in no way.

173
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:17,539
It is sometimes difficult to handle some
people who start arguing,

174
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:25,655
so best is not to argue. Tell them:
“By argument we cannot convince you.

175
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:29,932
It is not in the mind, it is beyond
the mind.”

176
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:36,698
Up to a point it’s all right, after that
you should give up: “All right, I’m sorry.”

177
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:45,693
Then your relationships in your family
should be good.

178
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:51,110
You can’t have Sahaja Yoga if there is
no understanding

179
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,625
between you, your wife, your children.

180
00:16:55,826 --> 00:17:01,151
We have to show that family is very
important in Sahaja Yoga,

181
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:06,993
extremely important, and children are
even more important.

182
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,850
You see how much we have done for
the children now,

183
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:17,242
we have got schools, this, that, is a very
big responsibility.

184
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:23,736
So we must understand what is
the responsibility.

185
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:27,848
We should not spoil the children.

186
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:32,920
We should appreciate whatever good they
are doing,

187
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,044
whatever nice things they are doing.
But if they do anything wrong,

188
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:41,651
you must tell them, “You are Sahaja Yogis
and you can't do like this.”

189
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:46,889
That you have to tell them, whatever it is,
you have to tell them.

190
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:51,202
If the children are very thin, then
understand they have got liver.

191
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,067
So liver should be treated.

192
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,734
And next time when you come to India

193
00:17:55,935 --> 00:18:00,766
we are going to get you all the medicines
of liver.

194
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,782
If they are very fat, then they are
left-sided.

195
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:11,051
Try to bring them to the centre with
the three candle treatment.

196
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,847
But first of all, test it what is
the situation.

197
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:19,832
Sometimes they develop a puffy fat, [that]
is all right, but they become all right.

198
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,311
So that is how you should look after
their health.

199
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:30,507
Then also look after their behaviour.
Tell them how to behave.

200
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:35,209
As I have seen in the West the children
are not properly brought up

201
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,326
because the parents neglect them, I won’t
blame the children.

202
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,940
Parents neglect them. You should be
loving, kind -

203
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:50,246
at the same time you must tell them what
is discipline is. It is very important.

204
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:56,527
Then keep a-watch on them: How they are,
what they are doing.

205
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:01,310
Of course, we have a school, but it has
limited seats there.

206
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:08,428
Whatever it is, they are going to adjust
as many as possible.

207
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:14,627
Even then supposing you have any problem,
don’t go arbitrarily into it.

208
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:23,605
You may ask your leader or you may write
to Me and inform Me.

209
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:27,619
Among you somebody might become very
ego-oriented,

210
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,203
may start his own organisation, “I will
do this.”

211
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,028
Let him say: “You get out” and he will
suffer.

212
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:39,200
You do not have to worry. “All right, you
get out.”

213
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,041
Anybody who is arbitrary will not work out.

214
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,145
Supposing one finger starts acting more
than the rest –

215
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:47,828
that means there is cancer, this is
malignancy.

216
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,830
So we can’t have malignancy.

217
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:54,816
All of you should work together with
understanding,

218
00:19:55,017 --> 00:20:01,929
before others as well as among yourselves.
It is very important to understand.

219
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,243
Now, Sahaja Yoga has worked out in so
many countries.

220
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:10,050
In such a big way in some, in such a small
way in some.

221
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:17,725
But wherever it is, Sahaja Yogis have to be
something special.

222
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:23,137
Even the children have to be something
special.

223
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:27,271
You have any other problem which you do
not want to discuss,

224
00:20:27,472 --> 00:20:32,461
with, say, with your leader, then you can
write to Me directly, no harm.

225
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:36,515
Either, if I answer well and good, if I do
not answer also well and good,

226
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:39,853
it will work out.

227
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:45,889
But attention should not be all the time
about yourself:

228
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,626
me, my family, my children, my house,
my job, no.

229
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:56,369
As soon as your attention is on other
people, it works out faster,

230
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,695
it helps you very much. But on yourself:
“I am sick.

231
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:05,497
I have this problem, that problem”,
nothing.

232
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:10,633
You are now at a stage when you can
absolutely solve all the problems,

233
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:14,476
but first and foremost thing: if your
attention is on yourself,

234
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:19,249
it won’t work out. Attention should be
on others.

235
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,169
And if it has to be on yourself, attention,

236
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,481
then just find out: “What’s wrong with me?”

237
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:33,088
But some people in that also go too far.
“Mother, my Agnya is catching.

238
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:37,642
Mother, my this is catching…” [it] is
nothing, [it] is nonsense.

239
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:42,882
Maybe you are catching from other people,
possible.

240
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:47,266
There are some nice books, now already
in Sahaja Yoga

241
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:55,415
translated in Chinese, luckily, and also
My tapes could be translated also.

242
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:59,724
But you have to keep My voice, as I told
you,

243
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:02,859
because that is mantra, isn’t it?

244
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:07,571
And you can have subtitles, would be better
if you could do it.

245
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:14,644
But it’s a very good idea that you can have
subtitles, really.

246
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:20,202
Specially for Russians if they could do
in Russia.

247
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:25,964
Now, [if] you have any questions, now you
can ask Me.

248
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:48,031
So it should be always like, if you are
Chinese,

249
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:53,037
then you should not only deal with Chinese.
They should all come to the collective.

250
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,824
Supposing you are Indians, you should not
only deal with the Indians,

251
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,867
but they should come to the collective.

252
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,747
Because unless and until they come
to the collective

253
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,275
[they] will not know what the problem is.

254
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:07,482
It’s not that you can organise separately
a group,

255
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:11,012
another group separately. It has to be
one group.

256
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:16,448
Of course, you could have two ashrams
or three ashrams, makes no difference.

257
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:22,720
Any other question?

258
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:26,338
Yogi: Is the camphor treatment good for
left side? Shri Mataji: What?

259
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,550
Yogi: Camphor … Yogi 2: Camphor treatment.

260
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:32,795
Yogi 2: The camphor treatment. He is asking
if the camphor treatment

261
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,181
is good for left side. Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi 2: The camphor.

262
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,449
Shri Mataji: No no no no. No need.

263
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,397
Camphor, only once in a while. Don’t do
camphor.

264
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:46,320
But you have done all mixed up things,
you see, just do left-sided treatment,

265
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:49,985
then you will be all right. Just mixed up.

266
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:54,010
And you cannot earn money in the name
of God

267
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:57,332
or Divine work, that’s one thing.

268
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,239
You cannot organise like that. No, never.

269
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,769
Because once you start getting it,

270
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:04,380
left-sided bhuts will come into you.
Yogi: I’ve never done that.

271
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:09,461
Shri Mataji: That is the part of Sahaja
Yoga. We cannot.

272
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:15,884
Also if you have any guru’s photographs
and all that,

273
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:19,353
it’s better to put them in the sea.

274
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:26,143
Because this keeping any photograph,
any book about them creates problems.

275
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:33,391
So religiously search it out and put them
in the sea.

276
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:36,416
[Video interrupts brieftly]

277
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,616
No no no no no no. No no no no. Don’t do
all that.

278
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:44,554
They will work on the photograph. If you
want to help somebody, you see,

279
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:49,897
some other people who have come, whom
you want to raise, don’t touch them.

280
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:55,634
Take a bandhan yourself and give them
a bandhan.

281
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:59,490
Put them before the photograph and you
just raise the Kundalini.

282
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:08,547
But be careful. Because you are still,
you see, not that sort of thing

283
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:12,566
that you cannot catch, you might catch.

284
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:18,885
So among yourselves also you should not
do that. Don’t touch.

285
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:21,673
If somebody says, “I have this problem”,
all right,

286
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:26,187
put him on the photograph, take a bandhan
yourself,

287
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:29,944
ask him to take a bandhan, you also give
a bandhan

288
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:34,777
and then raise the Kundalini. Be careful.

289
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:42,655
Even if there is somebody who has come
now who is a sick man.

290
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:48,080
So you can give them a photograph, [it] is
all right, if they are willing to do it.

291
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:54,941
But somebody in his family is willing
to take Sahaja Yoga,

292
00:25:55,142 --> 00:26:00,219
who is a healthy person, he should bring.
Otherwise don’t get after sick.

293
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,199
You will have many sick, in thousands
to begin with.

294
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,941
Don’t worry about sick.

295
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:13,681
Or if they are sick tell them to take
the photograph

296
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,869
and work it out, if they are left-sided
or right-sided.

297
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,620
Then the faith grows, they improve.

298
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:24,542
But you don’t touch the sick. No, no,
not at all.

299
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:33,569
We are not here to cure the sick, but we
are here to give realisation.

300
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:42,462
May God bless you.
Yogi: Shri Mataji, for technique,

301
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:45,465
if you have a problem on one side, you have
imbalance

302
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:50,510
and if the left side is weak or caught up,
do you raise the Kundalini

303
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,867
on this side and give a bandhan
to the other side? Correct?

304
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:56,705
Shri Mataji: Yes.

305
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:03,837
Supposing you are right-sided,

306
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:08,782
then you have to put down the right side,

307
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:13,278
remember that way, it’s much better.

308
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:17,217
So then you raise your left side and put
the right side down,

309
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:19,602
if you have right-side problem.

310
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:25,696
Now, if you have a left-side problem, so
you have to put down the left side.

311
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:34,211
It’s easier to remember this way. So
there is no confusion.

312
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:43,915
But tying up of Kundalini should be done
after you have moved out

313
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:46,258
left to right or right to left, whichever
way.

314
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:52,405
Then raise your Kundalini and tie up and
take a bandhan,

315
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:55,553
it’s the best way.

316
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:08,000
I would request you, all of you, to take
a photograph of yours

317
00:28:08,201 --> 00:28:15,085
and make an album, write it down below
that: what is your name,

318
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:20,556
date of birth and of Self-realisation.

319
00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:25,695
Send it over to Me. Because I go on seeing
them sometimes, you see.

320
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:30,791
So I’ll know you better and also I’ll have
My attention on you.

321
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:36,509
Of the children as well as of bigger
people.

322
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,496
So I’ll talk to you and talk to him

323
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,775
because you have little individual
problems, both of you.

324
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:51,172
What about you? Are you reconciled?

325
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:59,915
I’m going to get, you see, this one,
Werner, to task.

326
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:03,949
He came here to do Sahaja Yoga and not
to disturb a family.

327
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:11,078
He’s been very wrong. I’m going to be
very angry with him.

328
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:17,643
He is an old Sahaja Yogi, he should have
behaved himself.

329
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:23,088
It’s not - never to disturb a family. You
have such sweet beautiful children.

330
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:27,737
I will never support you in nonsense,
I must tell you.

331
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,982
And your husband is a very good man. If you
behave all right

332
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:36,265
he’ll come round to Sahaja Yoga, I’m sure.

333
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:41,033
You cannot be a Sahaja Yogi if you have
no dharma,

334
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:54,193
“shield” as Buddha has called it. It’s what
we call as your character.

335
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:59,495
Your morality is the most important
in Sahaja Yoga.

336
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:04,619
If you are not moral, it has no meaning
at all.

337
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,185
What we need is morality today. This is
happening everywhere, nonsense.

338
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:19,033
We have to imbibe it in ourselves and we
have to generate it for others also.

339
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,457
Whole world is full of immoral people.

340
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:27,941
A very, very few who are standing
for morality.

341
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:34,781
That is the greatest ornament we have.

342
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:46,422
All right? Don’t go astray. This will never
help you.

343
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:52,033
It was very wrong of you and also for
your children.

344
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:56,464
Now go back and behave yourself properly,

345
00:30:56,665 --> 00:31:00,735
otherwise you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

346
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:13,730
Ha, if there was something wrong, then
it’s all right.

347
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:17,608
We have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We allow
people to divorce.

348
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,528
But there should be substantial reason
for that.

349
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,187
“Or to sub thik hai” [Is everything
all right?] What are we to do?

350
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:36,707
That will do? All right.
Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

351
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:39,747
Shri Mataji: May God Bless you all.

352
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,222
I am sorry you had to come so late
in the night.

353
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:46,670
Yogi: Mother, we have a small gift for You.

354
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:50,686
Shri Mataji: Why, you’ve done so much!

355
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:59,131
Oh. Where is the children’s this thing,
presents?

356
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,579
My God, a small present, is it?
Yogi: It’s very small.

357
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,954
Shri Mataji: All right, what is this?

358
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,994
This is supposed to be small, is it?
From what angle?

359
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:37,974
Yogi: It’s just a big box!
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

360
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:50,311
Ah. So now. What is that? Let’s see.

361
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:56,750
My goodness.

362
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:02,260
This is the one for what?
Yogis: Confucius.

363
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:04,647
Yogis: Confucius. Guru.

364
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:07,847
Shri Mataji: Confucius!

365
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:20,638
He too has… you see?
Yogi: A stick.

366
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:27,955
Shri Mataji: Fine, such an expensive one.

367
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:34,915
Great. It’s very well done.

368
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:40,006
Is it written here Confucius?
Yogi: Yes.

369
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:47,149
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you very
much.

370
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:49,859
But you’ll have to bring it to India when
you come.

371
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,997
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”.]

372
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:58,178
But such an expensive thing, you should not
have bought it.

373
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:02,615
Yogi: Very good price, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Really?

374
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,881
What is this? Yogi: This is Lao-Zi.
Yogi: Lao-Zi.

375
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:09,273
Yogini: Lao-Tse. Yogi: Lao-Tse.
Shri Mataji: This is Lao-Tse?

376
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:12,437
Nice!

377
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,051
All right. He’s great I must say, Lao-Tse.

378
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:03,921
Beautiful. He’s sitting on the clouds.

379
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:09,710
Beautiful.

380
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:17,984
[Yogini: “Wow”.] Good.

381
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:27,111
This is His vahana. This is the one, is…
Yogi: Vehicle.

382
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:29,219
Shri Mataji: Vahana, you know, this vahana
is …

383
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,999
Yogi: Vehicle, isn’t it? Vehicle?
Shri Mataji: Conveyance.

384
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,796
Yogi: Conveyance, yes.
Yogini: Conveyance, yes.

385
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:44,074
Shri Mataji: Beautifully done. Thank you
very much, thank you.

386
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:50,510
Is written here?
Yogi: This is Lao-Tse.

387
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,243
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

388

when Buddhism first came to China.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

399
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:12,264
Buddhism didn’t talk of women.

400

much, thank you. Beautiful.

they? All right.

and sewing”]

Shri Mataji: Lacquer work. Thank you
very much.

So beautiful. Such a big lacquer work
I’ve never seen.

Chinese to come this time.

I’ll have to get lot more to carry all
these things.

for all the people from the East,

there’s a concession they offer and it’s
much cheaper.

430
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:54,885
I think what you can carry is quite a lot
but I don't know, they told Me...

431
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,520
I don't know how much – quite a bit
[not clearly audible].

432
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:02,650
So I think they can come, Chinese.

I'll ask them.

He’s done the pay week for Me.

444
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:58,964
Now for the girls.

445
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:05,907
He’s done a beautiful painting today,
you see?

446
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,222
Did you do this one?
Child: Yes.

447
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:37,234
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Good. Thank you.

448
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:42,695
[Conversation aside with a yogi] Where is
that tea set we had bought? Did you get it?

449
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:46,611
[Yogi: “Yes. Tea seats were at the back,
yes, two. There were two tea sets, Mother.

450
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:49,727
I took the small one. The small one”.]

451
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:55,320
Let it be now, you took only one so will
be a problem. All right.

452
00:43:55,543 --> 00:44:00,854
Who will get? I was thinking of dolls.
All right, for the girls.

453
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:09,596
Now. You write poems. All right.
Come along.

454
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:19,043
You want - which one you want? All right?

455
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:23,580
Who else? All the girls.

456
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,525
Ah.

457
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,824
Yes, good.

458
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:52,647
Very wise. Thank you.

459
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:09,060
Just… [To another girl] Which one?
All right.

460
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,366
[Aside to a girl] Did you get one?
Girl: No, it’s ok.

461
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:17,638
Shri Mataji: Is it all right?
Girl: It’s all right.

462
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,973
Shri Mataji: Very sweet.
Girl: They need it…

463
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:23,864
Boy: They need it more than you.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

464
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:32,907
We could give her that tea set, and all
that, so we have. Can you find that?

465
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,394
Girl: Thank you, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

466
00:45:58,848 --> 00:46:03,300
All right, come along, you are lucky.

467
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:07,639
Quite heavy. May God bless you.
Girl: Thank you very much.

468
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,294
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you.
Girl: Thank you.

469
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:16,215
Shri Mataji: You got it, Rishi?
Sahaja Yogi: Such cool vibrations.

470
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:21,002
[Unclear] [Indistinct conversation]

471
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:25,456
Shri Mataji: All right, Soma is better now?
Yogi: Yes, it has improved…

472
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,300
Shri Mataji: Better, yes.
Yogi: … since she came to Sahaja Yoga.

473
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,162
Girl: Thank you very much, Shri Mataji.

474
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:36,320
Shri Mataji: Next time I would like to see
your poems.

475
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:42,524
All right? Kuber, you too.

476
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:50,563
And also nice drawings. Where is
the drawing gone of Kuber?

477
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:55,404
This I want to take with Me.
It’s refreshing.

478
00:46:58,853 --> 00:47:03,051
All right. May God bless you. May God
bless you.

479
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:08,176
Look after yourself. And know that you are
Sahaja Yogis,

480
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:13,209
is a very big position, you are saints.
Special people.

481
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,479
You are the foundation.

482
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,837
Anyway I may go to mainland China and
talk to the…

483
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:32,363
Let’s see if Prime Minister listens to Me.
May be.

484
00:47:32,564 --> 00:47:35,604
May God bless you.

485
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:43,621
Yogis: Thank you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

486
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,040
Yogi: Thank You Mother, for coming
to Hong Kong…

487
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:50,428
Shri Mataji: Wah-wah.
Yogi: …and blessing us all.

488
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:57,655
Shri Mataji: You just wait and - you just
wait. [Yogi: “OK”.]

489
00:47:57,856 --> 00:48:01,468
Then I will go and talk to him.

490
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:04,708
May God bless you.

491
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:13,321
And I think people are very simple, very
simple people in North Korea.

492
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:16,000
You are South-Korean? Yogini: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Ah, I went to South Korea,

493
00:48:16,201 --> 00:48:20,630
I’m sorry, not North, South Korea.

494
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:27,431
But you see, still they have no idea
of a spiritual life. No idea.

495
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:31,329
So, you go there quite often?
Yogini: Yes, tomorrow I’ll go there.

496
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,145
Shri Mataji: She goes to… She goes…

497
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,422
Yogini 2: She is my sister who came here
today.

498
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:39,843
Shri Mataji: So start talking about Sahaja
Yoga. All right?

499
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:46,886
Yogini: Yes. It’s the first time…
Shri Mataji: No, no, you can do it.

500
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:51,087
So have programme, or something. And get
more people here

501
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:59,371
from South Korea. And send them over.
You can do very well.

502
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:02,758
Too much American influence.
[Yogini: “Right”.]

503
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:11,952
That’s the problem. And also then I saw
one programme

504
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:16,005
they had invited us to, supposed to be
a very special one.

505
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:22,579
And we were sitting on the top from
the galleries, you see, for VIPs

506
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,748
and downstairs, and I’ve never seen
such a show.

507
00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:31,908
Very dirty show they showed. Very dirty.

508
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:35,470
I’ve never seen. And CP was wearing his
glasses and he just closed his eyes,

509
00:49:35,671 --> 00:49:38,497
and I had to, said it, “Close your eyes,
you can’t bear it”.

510
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:44,303
And both of us vomited. Leave show.

511
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:48,571
I’ve never seen such a dirt anywhere.

512
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:52,314
You know, I mean, can’t imagine how
they have

513
00:49:52,515 --> 00:49:57,594
taken these things from these stupid
Americans.

514
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:02,070
You can work it out, all right?
May God bless you.

515
00:50:02,271 --> 00:50:06,082
Yoginis: Thank You, Mother.

516
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:09,991
Shri Mataji: We have to think of our
countries, we have to save them.

517
00:50:10,192 --> 00:50:17,029
Don’t you think so? It’s very important,
to save your own country.

518
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:23,689
Just I give you all the powers.
May God bless you.

519
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,041
First grow in Sahaja Yoga, first grow
in Sahaja Yoga,

520
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:29,437
these people can also come sometimes.

521
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:35,422
We can send some other people. We could
have programmes. All right?

522
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:37,142
May God bless you. Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again?

523
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:40,206
Yogini: Are You going
to come to Korea again, another time?

524
00:50:40,414 --> 00:50:42,539
Yogi: She is asking if You are you going
to come to Korea.

525
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:48,400
Shri Mataji: Anyone at this time - I’m
so busy now, I don’t know.

526
00:50:48,601 --> 00:50:54,053
Keeping Me too busy. That’s all right,
I think it will work out.

527
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:57,496
These people can go and work it out.
All right?

528
00:50:57,743 --> 00:51:01,454
Yogini: Thank you. /Shri Mataji: May God
bless you. /Yogini: Thank you.

529
00:51:01,655 --> 00:51:04,634
Shri Mataji: So, are you feeling better
now, with him?

530
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:07,095
You have Ekadasha, you know?
Yogini: Yes, I know.

531
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:11,252
Shri Mataji: Ekadasha means beginning
of cancer, do you know?

532
00:51:11,453 --> 00:51:16,190
Don’t struggle anymore. You know,
no mother can live without children.

533
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:22,088
See, all this is a temporary sort
of infatuation, finished, is this.

534
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,330
Mother is a mother.

535
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:29,366
How she stands, you know, for her children.
All right? That’s more important.
