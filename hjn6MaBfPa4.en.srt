1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
face yourself

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,279
for becoming

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,640
and then

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
the preparation is done

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,200
to become something

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
and on the whole when you know that it

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,079
is your ego and superego

8
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,079
which are loading you up

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,840
you have to scan them out with vibrato

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
awareness

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
now there are two

12
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,360
types of

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,360
attention we have to pay

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,360
first is a constant attention

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,280
that is a routine of a sahaja yogi

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
and the second one is the emergency

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
attention

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
i've been saying that all the sahaja

19
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
yogis must start

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
writing their diaries

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,439
one with every day's experiences

22
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,360
if you know that you have to write a

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
diary you'll keep your mind alert

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
and another one whenever you get any

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,360
special idea

26
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,960
of the past or of the future also to jot

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
it down so like that you should have two

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,439
dice

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,280
for your constant attention you have to

30
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
fix up your mind

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
on certain facts the first one as i said

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
that

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
if you keep a diary

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,599
then you will know that you have to

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
remember what important things have

36
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,959
happened

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,360
so your attention will be alert and

38
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,480
you'll be looking out for such points

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
where what is the thing you see

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
and you'll be amazed if you make your

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,080
attention alert

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:38,000
what new things come to you

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,959
very brilliant ideas

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,239
and the miracles of life and the

45
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,640
miracles of

46
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,440
god's beauty and his auspiciousness his

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
greatness his kindness his blessings how

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
they work out if you start writing every

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
day

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,360
even two lines about it

51
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,840
it will make your mind constantly

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,319
involved with it

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:09,519
that's a human style of doing things

54
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,519
also you can mention in the diary

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
what happened did you could you do your

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
meditation did you get your time for

57
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,400
meditation

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,879
a little bit as if you are

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
appearing for some sort of a examination

60
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,680
or something you

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,959
prepare a little note like that did i

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
get up in the morning did i

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
then any special thought or any special

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
movement

65
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,360
in the center or left or right also

66
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,360
should be mentioned so that

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,799
you keep a watch on your mind it's a

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,000
very good thing to maintain a diary

69
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,159
also you will see progressively how your

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
ideas are changing

71
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,680
how new priorities are settling down how

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,959
you give more importance

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
to real things and very little to unreal

74
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
things

75
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
i think this is a very very practical

76
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,560
side of human beings

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,200
that one should have a diary same

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,000
diaries after sometimes

79
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,120
will become historical things and people

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,639
would like to see

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,840
what you all have written not to be

82
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,800
hypocritical about it or deceptive about

83
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
it

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,080
but quite truthful and understanding

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,560
you should jot down few lies just before

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
sleeping

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,720
now we have to see that we have

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,600
problems for superego and ego

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
now superego is the left side as

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,759
darkness

91
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,800
tamagura and our past

92
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
those who have left side problems should

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
think of the future

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
use them balance if they think of the

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,039
future

96
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:11,360
for example a person

97
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,600
who is lethargic should take to working

98
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
put your mind into working for the

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,199
future planning what to do where to go

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,880
how to do that will keep you

101
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,120
away from drag up the

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,039
left side and

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
gradually then you can balance yourself

104
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
also

105
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:43,039
now the right side

106
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,280
of a person when it is activated very

107
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,280
much

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,680
he has to balance it

109
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,360
not with the left side but with the

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,840
center

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
that is a person who is very hardworking

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:12,479
must develop a witness statement

113
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,960
you try to do a work any work

114
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,280
indulge into work in thoughtless

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,919
awareness

116
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:26,240
as a witness whatever work you are doing

117
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,240
you just say that i am not doing it

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,960
this you can do it after realization

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
become thoughtlessly aware

120
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,120
and start doing your work

121
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,039
so the compensation of the left side is

122
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
done by movement to the right

123
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,600
and of the right side movement in the

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,919
center left side is the tamaguna

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,759
right side is the rajoguna the center is

126
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
the septum

127
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,599
still these are three good eyes that's

128
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
not the state

129
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,919
which you have to achieve about this

130
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
i'll tell you tomorrow more

131
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,800
how to go further

132
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:07,280
after scanning out which side is weak

133
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,120
you should plan out your style of life

134
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,639
for example if you are extremely

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
lethargic you cannot get up in the

136
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,680
morning

137
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,039
you feel very sleepy in the night you do

138
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,120
not feel alerted then start planning

139
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,520
as to what will you do how will you get

140
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,280
up even puja is a good idea

141
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
home is a good idea do something like

142
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
that you see so that

143
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,400
you have to do something what you call

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,880
the kriya is the action

145
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,479
get into the action some sort of action

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,240
you're going to

147
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,680
in sahaja yoga as well as in your daily

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
life

149
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,080
you'll be able to change that mood and

150
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
come to the right side

151
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
and then you go to the move your

152
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,160
movement should be towards the

153
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,160
satyaguna is to watch everything

154
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
now at this point where you are in the

155
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,360
center

156
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
you have to see

157
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
how much you are misidentified

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,280
so supposing you are at the first stage

159
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,560
of left side then you will just

160
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,840
do dreaming oh this person is so much

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
identified that one is so much

162
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,720
identified as if you are the best

163
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,240
is human nature you see well that person

164
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
is like that he's like that

165
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
this is very bad in the society that is

166
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,560
going bad in the society

167
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
it's better then we can also go to this

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
limitless to that guru is very bad

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,240
and that one is another mad gap like

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
that this is all day dreaming going on

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
how far it is affecting you how far you

172
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
are improving by that is not

173
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,560
it's just you see thinking analyzing it

174
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
it's insane this stuff

175
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,000
sitting down and just analyzing it's

176
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,040
amazing stuff

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,040
the second thing could be

178
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
when you come to the second side of it

179
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
is the kriya

180
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,640
then what happens when you start doing

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
it

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,920
then at least your attention is on what

183
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,760
you are doing

184
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,080
it's not allowed to drift into something

185
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
and which goes into any nonsense and can

186
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,160
i mean then you don't know from where

187
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,320
the funny thoughts are coming

188
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,320
so you start doing something you can go

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,160
and plant some trees or you can go and

190
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
plant some

191
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,360
flowers or if you want you can do some

192
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,560
cooking you can do some work

193
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,240
take to work that will help you

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,640
any work but while doing the work

195
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
the problem will be you'll develop ego

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,600
that's why when you are developing the

197
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,560
ego

198
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,279
you have to tell yourself you are not

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,080
doing mister

200
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,200
this you are not doing this is not doing

201
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
you are not doing

202
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,279
if you go on suggesting to yourself mr

203
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
ego will not come

204
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
and then many things you see which

205
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
normally trouble you and trouble others

206
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
like

207
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,440
you have cleaned the room all right then

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,680
somebody comes and spoils it you get

209
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
angry with that person

210
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,040
naturally because you think you have

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,640
done

212
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
first of all you don't clean the room if

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
you clean the room then you'll be

214
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,080
prepared it will be dirty otherwise you

215
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,080
do clean

216
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,880
now if it is dirty well and good if it

217
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
is not directed well and good

218
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,000
this type of attitude you should take

219
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,880
to jump onto saturn on sattva guna you

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
start accepting it you become extremely

221
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,440
mild

222
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,800
you become a mild personality then

223
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,680
at that time you do not discuss as to

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,120
oh i don't like it this was wrong this

225
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
should not have been all these things do

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,640
not come to you in saturn

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,480
you start seeing it that time you see

228
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,920
that all right doesn't matter it's done

229
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,279
it's time on the contrary you feel hurt

230
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,519
if you are a satyaguni that

231
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,160
by any suggestion you have suggested

232
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
your ego

233
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,880
can you get that point you feel ashamed

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
of your ego i mean to say

235
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
if you are a sabzi for example even to

236
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,519
say that this is my car

237
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
you will feel shy that's a sattvuli

238
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
style

239
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,399
or even to say why did you spoil my

240
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,320
carpet i mean in india nobody will say

241
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
i can tell you this regarded bad manners

242
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
absolute bad manners

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,800
if anybody comes to your house and the

244
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
carpet is well they sell it doesn't

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
matter

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
even it is brought i don't know let it

247
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120
be auto burnt

248
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,800
they'll never say that you're burnt by

249
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,160
carpet or done anything to my

250
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,959
is regarded bad manners like here you

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
see

252
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
somebody sleeping somebody makes the

253
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
noise

254
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,279
the person who is sleeping will never

255
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
say that you are making noise

256
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
let me get it he'll just get up and ask

257
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,880
do you need anything

258
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,040
that's difficult for people here to

259
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,360
understand because ego is

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,720
just sitting on there but these bad

261
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,160
manners

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
there you will find when you will go to

263
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,279
india you'll find this these are bad

264
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,240
manners

265
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,200
to say that or to say oh i feel very

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
comfortable

267
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,680
i mean to say i feel comfortable is bad

268
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,880
manners i mean they never say

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,720
i like it so what

270
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
all these words are not to be said if

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,680
you are in satragoni then you just don't

272
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,480
say

273
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,880
you say do you like it is it comfortable

274
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,240
would like to have this before attention

275
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,240
goes from your side

276
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,000
you understand that

277
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,320
that is the style one has to develop

278
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
then you are a satwa guri

279
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
otherwise you are still on ego trip you

280
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,079
see whatever you may say

281
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,079
i don't like that i don't i who are you

282
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
first of all ask the question who are

283
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
you

284
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,360
if god says i don't like you i can

285
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,000
understand the reasons

286
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,440
but for you to say i don't like it after

287
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
all how did you come on this earth

288
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
how did you get a human birth

289
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
how did you get all these things nothing

290
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
like that

291
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,040
who am i

292
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,600
i am nothing everybody who thinks i am

293
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,440
something he should know

294
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
that he is nothing makes no difference

295
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,480
to god whether he exists or does not

296
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,440
exist you see

297
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
he's not he's just

298
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,680
so this point if you understand that

299
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
even if you do something any work you do

300
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,880
or anything you are doing

301
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,279
you are just doing it because you want

302
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,279
to do it

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,800
that is how you come on to satyaguna

304
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
but normally it doesn't happen it

305
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,320
happens the other way around for example

306
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,720
a person

307
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,160
is say

308
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,320
doing something by any chance

309
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
he feels hurt or he thinks that whatever

310
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,839
he's done is no good

311
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
people don't appreciate or maybe he

312
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959
might think that

313
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
oh it's not up to the point or whatever

314
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
it is

315
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,199
then the reaction for him is not that he

316
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,839
does not like to rise to satyaguna but

317
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,959
he rises

318
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,959
he goes back to them

319
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,160
all right i'll not do it i'll sleep over

320
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,959
it let them do it

321
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,959
why should i do it

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
so the training that you have to have

323
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,199
through your rajaguna

324
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
goes the waste it's just a training

325
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,760
period

326
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,519
that you have you are doing something

327
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,440
now in the training period you have to

328
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,720
learn only how to

329
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,040
come in the center for example now

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,240
water is required for you to swim if

331
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,240
there is no water you cannot say

332
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
all right in the same way rajoguna is

333
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,519
required for you

334
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,360
to come to satyukra

335
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,160
if you do not do any work you cannot

336
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,160
come to satoku

337
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
so you are just working just to train

338
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
yourself

339
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
to be a witness now do you follow that

340
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,360
point

341
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,639
you are not doing it because you like

342
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,480
particular thing you are used to

343
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,040
particular thing because you want to be

344
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,079
this

345
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,079
this is not the way it is

346
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,519
you are just doing it to learn how to be

347
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
patient

348
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,079
to practice your patience

349
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,880
to see how much patient you are

350
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,320
once you start doing it you'll be amazed

351
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,839
that you will never feel the burden of

352
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
the work

353
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,560
but it never happens most of the people

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,440
if they find their work is not effective

355
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
they'll go back to tamagona

356
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
there are many attitudes say is working

357
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,759
then he thinks why should i do all the

358
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
work

359
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
others are not doing she'll go back to

360
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
their states

361
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
but those who are not working will not

362
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,040
think that this person is working let me

363
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,399
also work

364
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,320
it's other way around you see

365
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
this can be an attitude of some people

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,839
that if this person

367
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,079
is working let him work

368
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,320
this is even a meaner stuff avoid just

369
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,680
you go to a restaurant and somebody

370
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,639
takes out the purse others start looking

371
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,199
this side that's what you mean

372
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,560
i mean everybody should come forward

373
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,399
and once you are paid you played it

374
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,880
finished then you just don't start

375
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,160
counting

376
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,160
why did i pick once you try

377
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,120
or any work has to be done go forward

378
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,399
with it do it with your heart

379
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,079
don't worry if others have not done it

380
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,920
just do it for its pleasure and the

381
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,839
pleasure only you will get

382
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,680
well you will do it with the

383
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,040
understanding that it's a training

384
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,600
period you are better trained than the

385
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
other one is

386
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
you are at a higher class than the other

387
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,120
one so we have to

388
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
be at a higher class

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,240
for that this is just a training on

390
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,279
and that's how we can really

391
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,079
put our preparation into practice into

392
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,280
all details

393
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,079
to see how we work out our ego

394
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,799
and superego today in the morning i have

395
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,160
told you that

396
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,199
your intellect must

397
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
imbibe this within itself all right and

398
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,319
now i'm telling

399
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319
you that your action

400
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,439
action that you do must

401
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:36,000
be every time branded by you as

402
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
just your training

403
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,480
any action you do sometimes you have to

404
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,559
drive for miles together

405
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
you're trying your patience you see them

406
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,480
doing everything say they have to do go

407
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
for

408
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
say helicopter or say if they have to

409
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,120
drop from the

410
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,120
what you call them drop down

411
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,480
parachutes or helicopter you take away

412
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,960
or whatever it is

413
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
you go on doing it again and again isn't

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,760
it

415
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,440
you practice it again you drop many

416
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
times you break your legs you break your

417
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,400
hands you do this and do that

418
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,000
then you become a master you understand

419
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,320
my point

420
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
driving same way till you become a

421
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
master you go on in the same way

422
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,640
you are doing this work just to master

423
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,520
your patience

424
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
and that your love

425
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,679
is your love how much you love really

426
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,480
if you really love someone you are never

427
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
tired of working

428
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,440
you are never upset with working but if

429
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
you don't love

430
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
you start counting how much money how

431
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,480
much work

432
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,799
how many hours how much to be paid

433
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,919
all artificiality comes because there is

434
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,919
no love involved in you

435
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,000
whatever you don't want to do you don't

436
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,000
do it

437
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,600
to begin with to begin with you just

438
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,280
don't do what you don't like

439
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,240
to begin with but once you have mastered

440
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
that

441
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,600
then you have to master it that you do

442
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,600
something that you don't like

443
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
like meeting some buddhist for example

444
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,840
you don't want to meet

445
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,400
you want to run but you go little nearer

446
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
you see then develop a immunity for

447
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
these buddhis

448
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
after some time will not cast

449
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,760
you have to develop the immunity isn't

450
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,000
it otherwise one person comes and

451
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,000
everybody's head goes out

452
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
it's not the fellow improving you all go

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,799
out

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,919
so all these things are all these events

455
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,280
are for your

456
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
training your immunity

457
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,679
your immunity is to be trained

458
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,440
and when it is so when we are training

459
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,440
ourselves we should take it as a job

460
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,960
but the attitude should be extremely

461
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,400
positive

462
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,760
extremely positive and

463
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:18,000
all that is should be expressed in your

464
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,200
notebook whether you got dejected

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
or you got upset and disgusted you want

466
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,919
to run away from it all sorts of things

467
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
it's just a training to your mind

468
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,799
whatever is the situation wherever one

469
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,000
has to live

470
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,679
whatever one has to do

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,200
you should do whatever may be the

472
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,200
circumstances conditions

473
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,880
you'll be amazed you will not even know

474
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,320
what you have eaten in the morning what

475
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,000
you have it means

476
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,600
whether you are eaten or not you will

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,799
not

478
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,799
you will not fuss about it

479
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,559
do not worry about it you will not think

480
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:06,159
about it

481
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,159
but this being

482
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:16,080
the a is to reach the satavura

483
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,880
every other thing becomes 0. the

484
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,360
greatest

485
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,720
hurdle comes to sahaja yogis i've seen

486
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,720
when they start organizing

487
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
they start organizing something now

488
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,919
somebody wants something

489
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,200
so they'll run up to get the thing for

490
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,280
that person

491
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
now just have said that you must look

492
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
after the needs of others

493
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,960
but if i'm sitting here and there's a

494
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,600
lecture on then you better be

495
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
just listening to me you see this also

496
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
is

497
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,480
that how to have your prayers at this

498
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,600
time one

499
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,240
something working on you

500
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,159
this is the first thing you have to do

501
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,640
not that at this time you go

502
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,640
and cook

503
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,640
you have known the story of two sisters

504
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,640
attending on christ

505
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,760
all right so at this time

506
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:13,280
what is your first job is to try

507
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,200
to be more exposed to me

508
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
so that automatically you go into your

509
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,760
subtotal

510
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,080
this is the best but if i am not there

511
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,480
and when you are alone or when we are

512
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,159
with other sahaja yogis

513
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,200
you must now compete in rising higher

514
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,280
and higher

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,679
from tamaguna to rajaguna and from

516
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,760
rajaguna to sato

517
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,039
but actually by realization you have

518
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,520
gone beyond

519
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:46,880
these three ones you have gone beyond it

520
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,880
actually that is what has happened

521
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,559
but like clouds they cover you again and

522
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,559
again

523
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,280
and when the sky is covered with those

524
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
clouds

525
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,120
you cannot see the sun you cannot see

526
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
the moon you cannot see the stars

527
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
so we have to know how these clouds are

528
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,960
coming into us

529
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,400
and that's how we go into our complete

530
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,960
analysis

531
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,240
how these clouds are coming to us we

532
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,760
find out about our

533
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,400
different chakras what are the chakras

534
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
we are catching

535
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,280
here comes the another constant

536
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,480
attention

537
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,080
towards our channel are our vibrations

538
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,520
all right or not

539
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,320
why are we getting our vibrations

540
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,919
if not what chakra am i catching what

541
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,559
must be the catch

542
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,400
i must raise my kundalini see for myself

543
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,039
where is the catch

544
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,120
do i do my meditation or not if i do it

545
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,480
am i doing it just dozingly or

546
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,039
am i really in it am i

547
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,919
really feeling it or not am i alert or

548
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,360
not

549
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,240
all this is to be assiduously

550
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,080
sincerely absolutely truthfully should

551
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,279
be worked out

552
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,840
because it is a process between

553
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,840
yourselves

554
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,840
see it's a very funny it is so funny

555
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:20,960
relationship

556
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,960
that it is satisfied with happening

557
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,480
you have to be satisfied with yourself

558
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,400
there's nobody mataji is not concerned

559
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,840
nobody is concerned it is you

560
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
are concerned with yourself

561
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
you
