Sahaja Culture and Ego
New Jersey Ashram, USA

2
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,310
October 26, 1985

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

4
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.
But it must have a culture. So far in all

5
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:26,039
the religions there is no combination of religion
and culture. No religion has. That's why everywhere

6
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,659
you find different cultures. Say in India,
people who follow Hindu religion have different

7
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,990
cultures in different places. They are living
in Lucknow, or say in U.P., they have a Muslim

8
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,990
culture. More Islamic style. They'll eat in
one plate, do all kinds of things which normally

9
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:55,990
a South Indian won't do, and the South Indians
have a different culture from Maharashtrians.

10
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,319
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

11
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:09,140
we find varieties. So the cultures get influenced
by the neighboring cultures or surrounding

12
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,890
cultures, and that's how people get lost.

13
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,940
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

14
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,640
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:34,640
with the Spirit. So when we talk of Sahaja
Culture, it is the culture of the Spirit.

16
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,950
Now what is a culture? First of all let us
see what is a culture is. So the culture is

17
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,450
the pattern of behavior we have with others.
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed

18
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:54,200
to have with others. Like in English language,
for example, we'll say "Thank you". Even if

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:01,200
somebody murders, you may say, "Thank you".
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

20
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,910
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?" Every time,

21
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,920
"Sorry". As if "sorry" is a word so easily
to be used. I mean if you are sorry, why are

22
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,560
you sorry for that? "Sorry?" On the phone
they used to first say, "I beg your pardon?",

23
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,560
was sensible; but now I find everybody, A
to Z, says, "Sorry?" I mean, it has no meaning,

24
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,650
because what are you sorry about? Says "Sorry?"
For everything they are sorry. Or we can say

25
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,150
in English language, when we speak, "I'm afraid".
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid". What

26
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,530
are you afraid of? The whole world is afraid
of you.

27
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,530
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

28
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,840
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality. It
has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,

29
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,390
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

30
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:08,390
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture. Apart from that it integrates all

31
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,010
the essences of all the cultures.

32
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:17,010
So 
it emanates from the spirit. Now, spirit has
two sides. One side which you see, the another

33
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,710
you don't see, like the moon. The side you
see is outside with other people, other Sahaja

34
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Yogis, other people, other societies, which
are not yourself, absolutely. The other side

35
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:48,160
you don't see is the relationship with God
Almighty, relationship with your Mother. If

36
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,470
the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

37
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,870
become crooked and not Sahaj. So it's the
other way round than any other culture. To

38
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,270
know any other culture what do we go? We see
how they talk, what is their language, how

39
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,150
they speak, how they behave: all the outside
things we get. We must know "thank you" if

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,150
we want to know English language, must know
"thank you", "please", all that. But if you

41
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,910
want to know the Sahaja culture, you have
to know your Mother, and you have to know

42
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,680
God Almighty. And the relationship between
your Mother and the God Almighty has to be

43
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,680
absolutely perfect. Then there's no problem.
But that, the relationship, if it is not all

44
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,600
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.
That is one thing for sure. Artificial Sahaj

45
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,520
culture is not all right. I would say that
India has, in its basics, the culture of the

46
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,520
spirit, India has; because for traditions
and traditions in India, and for ages, people

47
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,199
have been seeking the truth. Spiritually they
are endowed, because of the saints. They are

48
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,840
blessed specially because they have been seekers,
not of material things, but of the spirit.

49
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

50
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,130
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

51
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,840
spirit. So they form a pattern, but there
is lot of artificiality in that also has grown.

52
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,840
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

53
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,610
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

54
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,810
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls. So the whole culture has

55
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,620
become so nonsensical sometimes that you don't
know where to look.

56
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,620
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

57
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:36,580
yourself. First of all you should face yourself,
how you feel about your Mother and about God

58
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Almighty. First of all, how much liberty you
take of your Mother? How much granted, take

59
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:01,250
for granted your Mother? She's a Mahamaya.
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

60
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,720
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

61
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,990
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

62
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,759
that, is one side. Another side is complete
indifference to your Mother. So it is to be

63
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:39,810
known through your heart. You don't have to
talk to Me. I know whose heart is pulsating.

64
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:48,930
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are. You may not be knowing yourself

65
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,399
also. I may not say, but I know you in all
details, out of which I may say little bit,

66
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,880
because I am too gentle to say things. Because
again of Sahaj culture. Because of Sahaj culture,

67
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,820
I cannot say everything to you on your face.
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct

68
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,100
it; if not possible, then I say to you. Then
in that you have to also see how much worshipful

69
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,100
you are. Some people, though they spend more
time with Me, remain with Me, want to be with

70
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:34,690
Me, it is only when they feel surrendered,
also. So it should not be confused: if somebody

71
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,000
is spending more time with Me, you should
not condemn yourself for that. It's all right.

72
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,580
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

73
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,570
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person? You see it has

74
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:57,570
one side and the another is the expression.
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk

75
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:06,580
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't
talk. Common sense, he listens. Even people

76
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:18,140
who are very good, I've seen when I'm talking,
they'll put in their own words in between.

77
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:25,209
People who are very good, I should say. So
the surrendering is not full. Then the time,

78
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:32,209
they become very conscious of the time. Who
has made the time? But the person won't come

79
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,680
directly and tell Me, but tell somebody else,
"Go and tell Mother, She has to go at this

80
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,380
time." I know everything, who tells whom,
who goes to whom, who is telling someone,

81
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:50,380
who is time-bound. And then I flout it. I
know what time to reach, what is the auspicious

82
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,209
time, how it will work out.

83
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,110
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry. I would say Dumahl is

84
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,770
one of them who is a very great surrendered
fellow. When I went there I was very tired,

85
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,610
and he said. "Mother, if You want to rest
You can rest."

86
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,779
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

87
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:17,110
So he just left Me alone. I was really very
tired because I had a very long journey, and

88
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,170
then this and that, and then I went down all
the way there. I thought, "I'll lie down,

89
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,020
and sleep off. " Of course, as I know that
everything has to be done at right time, I

90
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:37,020
just went down. And we had a program of My
reception at one place in a village, and they

91
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,570
were all waiting for Me there. And I was sleeping;
he wouldn't wake Me up. He wouldn't wake Me

92
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,570
up. He said, "Everything will be all right.
Tell them when Mother will come." So there

93
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,370
was sun on, they were all sitting under the
tree, sun was scorchingly hot. They were nicely

94
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:06,370
having a nice nap under the tree and all that.
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,

95
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,980
everything worked out. And when I got up it
was about five-thirty, then he told Me that,

96
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,750
"Mother, I didn't tell You the program." He
never tells Me. If I get something written,

97
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,740
well and good, but, "You were sleeping, I
didn't want to disturb You."

98
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,330
"What's the program?"

99
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,300
"It was at three o'clock."

100
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,350
I said, "Three o'clock. Why didn't you tell
Me? Why didn't you wake Me?"

101
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,149
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother. It's all right."

102
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:37,149
So we started off at six o'clock. Sun had
gone down. By that time they arranged beautiful

103
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
lights and fireworks and everything, and all
the rushing about was finished, they're very

104
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,910
well settled. And the people from distant
villages had also arrived, and they had organized

105
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,760
them so well, and they had a proper time,
and are very happy that I came late because

106
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,410
sun was not there, so scorchingly hot. By
the time we reached about seven o'clock it

107
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:12,410
was night and they illumined the lights, and
the diwali like this was put up everywhere,

108
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,320
and they got everything, they had sufficient
time to do everything. Then Dumahl said, "I

109
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,320
knew, Mother, You are awake, and You were
managing."

110
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,140
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me. You can just tell

111
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:37,000
Me, "We have to leave at this time." But if
I don't have to leave, I will not leave whatever

112
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you may do. In My own sweet way; you will
never find Me obstinate, but I am. Because

113
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,920
I know what is right is what is right, and
has to be done that way. But otherwise I'm

114
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,450
very calm, I am not bothered. I never organize
you, I never hurry you, I never do anything

115
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:06,450
that should upset you. Spirit is never upset,
never excited, never hurries, and never is

116
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:14,230
what you call that "go-go" business. Like
now, we have to go to the airport. You'll

117
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,370
find everybody was like an aeroplane - round,
round, round, round. What has happened?

118
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,790
"Oh, we had to go? We'd.."

119
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,790
"We have to go, all right. So what?"

120
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,790
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

121
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,029
are outside. But if you are one with your
spirit you're absolutely calm, absolutely

122
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:41,029
calm, "All right, we have to go, all right,
we'll reach there. Doesn't matter." The other

123
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,230
day we had to go for some shopping, I was
trying to buy some saris for Indian ladies.

124
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,269
We got lost. I never bothered them at all.
They were going round and round, and round

125
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,600
and round. And then Danny realized and said,
"I think perhaps we had to leave vibrations

126
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,010
in all these places."

127
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,820
I said, "Correct."

128
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,480
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about. Anybody else would be saying, "What's

129
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,800
this? You can't find the place, what's the
matter with you?” Calm. We reached the shop

130
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,130
at the right time, got everything at the right
time, did everything, came back at right time.

131
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,430
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that

132
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:25,870
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."
Why are you saving time? For what are you

133
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,880
saving time?

134
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,870
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses. It's always in the present.

135
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,870
That's the reality. Now in the West people
are very futuristic, extremely futuristic,

136
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,399
and their futuristicness sometimes takes them
to points, say for example if they have to

137
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,660
go by train. So instead of arriving at the
right station, they'll go to the station which

138
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,899
is further on. And then again they'll arrive
at the further on. The train will never reach

139
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:06,899
them. Sort of temperament they have. So one
should not plan at all anything like that,

140
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,970
that fixes you. But at this moment, if I have
to be told that we have to go at this time,

141
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,720
is all right, finished now. At this moment
I've told, is recorded, finished. All right?

142
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,839
So it's gone into the memory. There's nothing
to worry about it now. Now, present moment,

143
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,839
what are we doing? In a very calm way, witness
it. Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

144
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,510
"Where is my mind going?" Now somebody who
has to cook must be thinking, "Oh, I have

145
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,889
to get this, I have to get that." Once you
start saying that "I have to do it", you'll

146
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,889
never be able to do it that way. But you said,
"All right, just now I'm in meditation." Every

147
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,660
moment, "I am in meditation." Everything will
walk up to you, even matter, and you'll get

148
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:09,110
the right things at the right place. You'll
meet right people at the right place. The

149
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,339
other day we were just walking, strolling
around. Whom do we find there? Carolyn. She

150
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:24,339
just walked out. There is she, I mean I met
her. She said, "Christine is just next door."

151
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,580
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

152
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:36,580
she saw Me. Beautiful experience for Me and
her, she was so happy. Then we went together.

153
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:45,530
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

154
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,530
your spirit. So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees
watch, then he's not a Sahaja yogi. But the

155
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:02,850
other side could be that the Sahaja yogis
are never in time where they have to be. Very

156
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:11,179
common in England. I reach always first, to
open the door. And to clean it also sometimes.

157
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,059
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

158
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,270
Yoga is. You have to be alert, alert, absolutely
alert. If you are alert, immediately you'll

159
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:37,270
know "I have to go now at this time. I have
to do it. I have to get this thing now." If

160
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,600
you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it. That's what it is. So, there's

161
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,809
a beautiful thing written down, like they
say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun" - "The

162
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:55,809
way You keep me, the way I am, will be happy."
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,

163
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:04,830
is important. Because ego will plan out, "Oh,
we'll go there, we must get for Mother, say,

164
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,110
daisies", we decide. "Must get daisies." You
don't find daisies, you're disappointed. Why

165
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,270
not? These are all My flowers, whether they
are daisies or not, they look so nice. Whatever

166
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:22,270
you get, you get it. That's the thing wanted.
You know that, that the Divine is working

167
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,940
out everything for you. When you are supposed
to get something else, better have it. Even

168
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:39,020
by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some things,
like a book or something, immediately I'll

169
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,600
open it out and see why this book has come
in My attention; why this fellow has come

170
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,600
in My attention; why this is happening. And
immediately I find that there’s some connection,

171
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,140
something has to be done, something has to
be said, something has to be worked out.

172
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:04,140
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

173
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,520
by his calmness and relaxed attitude. Relaxation
never means lethargy, by any chance. It doesn't

174
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:24,950
mean lethargy. Lethargy is against relaxation.
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

175
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:31,950
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm. These two things for human beings is

176
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:42,010
an impossibility, because if they are alert,
if they are alert then they're not calm. If

177
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:52,080
they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm. So this is one of the

178
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,160
things one has to remember, that you have
to witness yourself all the time. Not to condemn

179
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,570
yourself, but witness. Now I said the word
"witness" means "detached". Now what happens

180
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:11,570
with this, when you start condemning yourself,
you miss every good point. For example, you

181
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:20,070
have some experience of a sudden height being
achieved. All right? At that point you should

182
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:30,820
catch hold of it, hold on to it, keep doing,
but don't forget that you may go back, no.

183
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,289
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it. That's how you climb

184
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:44,970
Himalayas. But not that, "Oh Ma. Now it's
all right, but what will happen next?" Then

185
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:51,970
you are gone down, because you have to face
yourself in the way, knowing what are your

186
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,470
powers. You are a spirit now, you are no more
an ordinary human being, so you have no business

187
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:04,470
to condemn yourself, or to degrade yourself,
or in any way to feel unhappy. No way. Past

188
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,380
is past. What happened a moment before is
finished. "Now I am going to rise. Now I am

189
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,520
going to rise."

190
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,520
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

191
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:34,850
personality. A person who is of that kind,
an inspired visionary, then other people get

192
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:46,799
impressed by such a person that, "See, there's
a man who's inspired, who talks in an inspired

193
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
way, in a way that is something very different
from others." Something new he says, new that

194
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,910
is nourishing. Such a personality - like the
other day, you see, we heard the lectures

195
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,910
of so many people, and when the New Zealand
Prime Minister was coming C.P. said, "Now

196
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,090
let's go back, because we'll have a little
tea or something."

197
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,919
I said: "No, you listen to this man. He's
a realized soul."

198
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,620
He said, "Really?"

199
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,230
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

200
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,190
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

201
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,919
what is he going to speak?" You see, they
were moving about, making a… Within two

202
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,100
minutes he captured everybody's attention,
you see, and he was bubbling with everything,

203
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,360
so beautifully, and he spoke all the points
so much different, and so much new and so

204
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,780
much better. C.P. was amazed. He said, "How
do You know?"

205
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,030
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

206
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:52,740
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul. You'll be surprised, after our Prime

207
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,990
Minister finished his lecture and all that,
after two or three lectures he was to go;

208
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:02,740
then he turned round and went to this Australian
[Shri Mataji may have meant New Zealand] Prime

209
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,559
Minister, only him, went and congratulated
him, congratulated him. Congratulated and

210
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,370
said something very close to him. And the
fellow again, you see, flew up into joy. We

211
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,900
see it's all there. And then he came away.
Why? Because one realized soul understands

212
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,929
another realized soul, and everybody was amazed:
why did he turn to this man alone, and went

213
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:31,929
and congratulated him? So such a large country
like India represented by our Prime Minister,

214
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,190
goes down all the way to a little country
like New Zealand which is nothing compared

215
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:42,500
to India, and congratulates. And that's a
developed country, this is a developing country.

216
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,650
Is something people did not understand. And
the whole joyous atmosphere both of them shaking

217
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:54,650
hands created. This is Sahaja culture, in
which you recognize a realized soul, the dignity

218
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,549
of a realized soul.

219
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:06,549
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis. But I've seen

220
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:14,659
most of the people are more congenial with
others, and less congenial with Sahaja yogis.

221
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,980
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them. I sometimes say, "All

222
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,270
right. I don't think this fellow is very good"
and all that. But when the other person turns

223
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:34,580
round and shows compassion and says, "No,
Mother, I think it will work out" then I like

224
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:41,289
it. I like that. Or else sometimes I say,
"Oh, let them go away. There should be no

225
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:48,289
more food for them, it's all right." No, Mother,
we've made food for them." So the culture

226
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,960
of Sahaj is to give. Give, and give, and give,
and never ask for a reward. Never thinks,

227
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:06,090
"What I have to get". After all, you have
got the highest that anybody could get. They

228
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:14,610
said the three heights a human being can achieve
in spirituality, which you all got in no time.

229
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,440
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.
Salokya is that you should be able to see

230
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:33,419
God. That you got. Samipya is the closeness
with God. Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

231
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:50,860
You have got all these three. In one incarnation
you've got it. When Gods incarnated before,

232
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:07,299
nobody knew that they were Gods. So even they
got it, they never knew. Very few people knew

233
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,919
about them. But even when Christ said He was
the Son of God, who, how many believed Him?

234
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,600
They crucified Him. Because they were not
realized souls. But by giving you realization

235
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:41,390
I have given you that capacity to get all
these three blessings at one shot. I speak

236
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,080
your language, I speak your style, I live
with your style, and you understand Me. There

237
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,179
is no problem. But with other Gods, imagine
if I were Mahakali today, what would have

238
00:27:53,179 --> 00:28:00,179
happened. You would be all upside-down there
hanging, seeing Me from the other way round.

239
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,350
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

240
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:12,350
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them. But because you've

241
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:23,610
got them, you don't understand. You take it
for granted. There's no shraddha. With this

242
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:36,049
experience there should be tremendous faith.
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and

243
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:48,620
you, in between. Is we can say, the ocean
of joy that is in between. Whatever I emit

244
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:57,190
to you is that shraddha, and when you are
drenched into it, the joy of that shraddha

245
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,360
makes everything so sahaj. But for that you
must open your hearts. A Sahaja yogi who is

246
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:26,150
secretive, who is insular, who is jealous,
who separates himself from others is no good.

247
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:35,669
Open your heart. Give away your things, doesn't
matter. Matter has only one value, that it

248
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:48,529
can communicate your Sahaj culture. Little
things, you see, I see something that you

249
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,460
have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya acting
on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

250
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:10,730
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."
"Ah, sorry."

251
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,309
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see. But the

252
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:26,080
joy is so much that I can't help it sometimes
I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful, this one."

253
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,080
"You gave us, Mother." And the whole rapport
and the whole feeling; I feeling a little

254
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:40,909
shy about it, and all, they're so beautiful,
so dramatic; so dramatic it is, so poetic.

255
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,370
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.
Of course to be human being you should be

256
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:54,370
ashamed of yourself sometimes. Otherwise the
drama is not complete. So the whole thing

257
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,620
is so beautiful and so joyous. But that gentleness
towards others and yourself should be there.

258
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,820
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

259
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,710
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

260
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:23,700
yogi at all. They should be bubbling with
laughter, joy all the time. I cannot be serious

261
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,700
for more than, I think, five seconds perhaps.
I don't know. I try, because lectures should

262
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:38,179
be serious to go into the hearts of the people.
But there's not, and you can see that even

263
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:45,179
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

264
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:54,159
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say. You see, the culture

265
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,350
where people are just glum like this, is the
same as the people where they are frivolous.

266
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,350
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

267
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,200
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you. Anything

268
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,200
is possible with them, just to amuse you,
you see, too - for cheap popularity. Anything

269
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:28,049
frivolous, stupid, they will do. But supposing,
you see, it is say an English old conservative

270
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:35,220
personality, then a lady might wear a very
official dress with the lines and this and

271
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:45,020
that, and like a man she might become very
soon, like that, develop a very serious face.

272
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:51,370
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.
You have to be natural, and natural everything

273
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:58,370
is always bubbling with joy. And a message.
And a message. These flowers are the message

274
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:06,970
of My coming, writ large on them.

275
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:13,970
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

276
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,640
see, "Oh, this is the man. He is the sahaja
fellow." You can see that clearly. There's

277
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,980
no seriousness, there's no unhappiness, nothing.
Supposing I have said something that might

278
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:31,809
be upsetting you, forget it. If you cannot
forget that, then you have not listened to

279
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:37,770
Me. But "forget" doesn't mean that you do
not act upon it. "Acting upon it" means that

280
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:43,630
you face yourself and see for yourself how
you have ascended and how far you have to

281
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,919
go, not how you'll fall down. So it is all
the time acting on both sides, as I'm telling

282
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,029
you in My lecture, that on one side you'll
see to yourself as relationship with Me, and

283
00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:02,029
relationship with others. For a Sahaja yogi
it should not matter whether you are in a

284
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:11,309
palace or on the street.

285
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:15,299
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

286
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:22,299
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

287
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:29,809
of India. The reason is, they were analyzing:
they have no good bathrooms, no showers. But

288
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:37,329
you have the whole sky. You have all the mountains.
You have all the trees. You have got all the

289
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:44,869
waters flowing. But you want to have a little
shower, in which you can't even move. Just

290
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:54,719
an idea, just an idea of comfort. You have
no comforts, if you ask Me, compared to what

291
00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:03,539
we have in India. No comforts at all. I mean,
ask any Indian girl to come and stay, she

292
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:12,499
will cry. Even I think here the President,
the President has to wash his utensils perhaps,

293
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:19,499
maybe. What a comfort. There's no division
of labor. Now in our country we have servants,

294
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:24,690
but "servants" doesn't mean that we cheat
them anything else. They eat the same food

295
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,109
as we eat. They live the same way we live.
But they do different type of work, because

296
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:35,459
they don't have the same mental capacity to
be the President. The President does some

297
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:42,459
other work. You have no comfort of any kind,
you take it from Me. Food matter, you get

298
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:49,289
everything processed food. Imagine, any time
you might be developing cancer due to processed

299
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:56,059
food. What is your speciality then? Try to
understand. What is the kind of food: it's

300
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:01,089
not fresh, God knows how it is processed,
how it is preserved, from where it is coming.

301
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:07,180
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

302
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,150
it has got something contaminated." So everybody
rushes, you see, to the store room, because

303
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,589
we have to store up all these things. You
can't get at the right…. "Oh it's there";

304
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:23,589
then you start throwing them out. It's a mad
racing because people think that, "God knows

305
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:33,069
what we are eating today, is it correct or
not?" So food-wise you are zero. Best thing

306
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:41,940
is to live in the villages or in the forests,
to get the fresh fruits, wash them in clean

307
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:49,219
flowing water of a river, eat it nicely and
sit down enjoying the sun.

308
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:58,420
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

309
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:05,420
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving. Say

310
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:15,249
I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back. Going

311
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:22,059
further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

312
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,729
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

313
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:31,489
you, clear you out, finished. Till then I
won't be comfortable; though I'll suffer,

314
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:36,450
I'll have pains, I'll have this, that. As
soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like this

315
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:43,450
going on. Corrected it. I took it upon Myself,
I sucked it into Me. So they are adventurous.

316
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:51,920
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching." Finished. But now the compassion

317
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,219
can only work out if you have that kind of
a spirit, otherwise you cannot. It becomes

318
00:37:58,219 --> 00:37:58,789
sympathy.

319
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:05,009
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is. I mean,

320
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:10,619
I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching. I would say in

321
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,479
an ashram, that person should clear out. But
all the ashramites will catch from that person,

322
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:23,479
and that person will never be all right. There's
a very nice joke about it. There was a lady,

323
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:30,309
she wanted to reduce herself. So there was
a machine like a rolling-pin. They said, "If

324
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,759
you rub it, then you will reduce." So she
brought, poor thing, she brought the machine

325
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:42,759
and she started rolling it. She found that
the rolling-pin became fat, instead of she

326
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:53,989
reducing. Same thing is in Sahaja yoga. Instead
of Sahaja yogis correcting the others, they

327
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:01,650
get contaminated. That's why I said, "Don't
have anybody in the ashram." Because you sympathize.

328
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,029
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

329
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:11,410
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it. I do it for thousands and thousands

330
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,910
and thousands; you have to do it for one or
two, so you are never bothered. And that's

331
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,959
how you become strong. Not by shunning them,
running away from them or condemning yourself,

332
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:27,959
or saying that: "We must save ourselves on
the boat." No. Through adventure. "Let's see

333
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,229
what happens". Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing
catches me, Mother, what is it?"

334
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:40,229
I said: "But who will catch you? Those who
will catch will be hurt themselves."

335
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:48,549
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to

336
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,509
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

337
00:39:54,509 --> 00:40:00,440
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

338
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,130
catch you. You'll catch it for a while. But
what I find now, I came to this ashram, everybody's

339
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:14,130
left Nabhi caught up. Everybody's left Agnya
caught up. So then I get the pain. Everyone.

340
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:20,499
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that? You are part and parcel of

341
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:27,499
My body, you are the cells in My body. And
when you catch, I also catch; not catch, but

342
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,559
I really get the pain, but I clear it. In
the same way, I have given you powers. Every

343
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:43,699
power I have, I have given you. But you have
to develop it and you have to be adventurous.

344
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:56,449
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

345
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:03,449
very cheap." Very economical, that's the first
comfort. It's surprising, for a Western person,

346
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:13,299
it is very important that it should be economical,
surprising, affluent people think more of

347
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:20,299
saving money than the people who are poor.
And English are the last word, save pounds,

348
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:30,089
at the cost of others. On the contrary if
you go to India, where they’ll be very happy,

349
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:36,959
they'll invite you in their house. Whatever
they have they will give it to you, "Eat,

350
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:42,559
eat, eat." They'll force you. They'll be very
happy to give. But in England it's very dangerous,

351
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:48,799
you see. Sometimes in the ashram they may
not even have food for Me. Really. And if

352
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:55,430
you tell them, "I know. I know." You know.
Finished. Then what do you say? They already

353
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,160
know it, now what to do? They know.

354
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,160
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation. In India also I've seen

355
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:12,499
people who get little more money than the
rest become very money-oriented. Money becomes

356
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:19,019
everything, money becomes the power, money
becomes their life. Sahaja yogi doesn't care

357
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:26,019
for money. Just.. is the dust of our Mother's
feet. What is money, what is wealth? And when

358
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:35,789
they do like that, then their money problems
are solved. If you have a money problem, know

359
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:42,789
that there's a problem. If you are very particular
about money. I am, in a way, because if I

360
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:49,779
have to give somebody, I remember it. But
I've seen people who are very anxious to tell

361
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:54,479
Me that, "You have to pay this man so much,
that man so much." That's wrong. That's not

362
00:42:54,479 --> 00:43:00,119
your look-out. That's very, very wrong to
tell Me that, "You have to pay this man or

363
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:07,119
that man." It's not important. Even if I don't
pay, I pay him. So in relationship with Me,

364
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,809
you are not to tell Me that, "You have to
pay so much money to him, this much money

365
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:18,440
should be paid, this is what he owes You."
Nothing of the kind. Let the person come and

366
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,440
tell Me. Why are you telling? That kind of
a message if you give Me, you are lost. Or

367
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:31,459
if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

368
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:38,459
Somebody is hurrying You up." If somebody
is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't hurry Mother."

369
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:47,069
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

370
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:59,099
that is working it out. Something very tremendous,
a big organization. You can't see it, it is

371
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,119
microscopic. You must know, nobody got realization
like that, did they? Thousands getting realization,

372
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:15,119
what's happening? There must be something
about… Now how can you tell anything to

373
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:20,890
such an organization? They don't like it.
They know it. Actually they are the ones who

374
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:26,019
know, not the English. They know what is to
be done.

375
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:33,019
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture. So it is a Mother's cult, you can

376
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:42,229
call it, the Mother's culture. How we are
connected with our Mother. I have seen people,

377
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:49,930
if somebody is rude to them, they get very
angry. But if somebody is rude to Me they

378
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:56,930
don't feel angry. It should be the other way
round. Now I'll give you an example. This

379
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Merv Griffin was funny, and both our PRO’s
were very angry. It was natural and very…

380
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:12,369
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.
And Worlikar of course was on top of this

381
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:19,369
thing. But the other fellow would not. He
was giving arguments. I was just watching.

382
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:27,539
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...
There's another one there, he never came to

383
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:35,199
receive Me at the airport. So Worlikar said,
"If your own mother had come, you would not

384
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:42,199
have gone?" Then one can give explanation,
"Oh, but our Mother is Adi Shakti. My mother

385
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:52,089
is not, she's helpless." It's not. To show
your respect, to show your love, you have

386
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:59,089
to go; for your own gain, not for Her gain.
For your own gain. This relationship is for

387
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:08,339
your own gain. Supposing if you strike oil,
is it for your gain or for the gain of the

388
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:15,719
oil? If you get to the Source, is it for the
Source to gain anything, or it is for you

389
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:25,859
to gain anything? Logic, simple logic. So
in that culture, you see, you really thrive

390
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:33,609
and you become extremely a happy person, a
joyous person. And the expression of such

391
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:46,410
a person is so different, because such a person,
as I told you, rises above and sees the problems

392
00:46:48,279 --> 00:46:55,279
of others, the decadence of the society, sees
all the problems of the world. Not only that,

393
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:04,380
but knows the solutions. We are not like these
ordinary people who have racialism, this..

394
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,099
other diseases, I don't know what sort of
diseases they have, I also forget. Racialism

395
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:18,609
now, it's another stupid nonsense, you know.
What is racialism? God has made somebody's

396
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,769
color like this and somebody's color like
that, and those same racists are trying to

397
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:30,769
tan their faces.

398
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:41,150
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things. What we are bothered

399
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:48,809
about is our inner cleanliness, inner beauty,
but that doesn't mean that you should move

400
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:57,279
about like primitive people, no. But if there
is inner beauty, then outer beauty comes.

401
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,049
You will never find Me dirtily dressed. You
will never find Me without a sari on, even

402
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:09,739
when I sleep I wear a sari, because in the
night also I have to work, so how can I go

403
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:16,739
in My dressing-gown to the other world? So
a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be an

404
00:48:22,059 --> 00:48:28,989
extremely neat and a clean person, but not
to tell others, but should be himself or herself.

405
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:33,769
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

406
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:39,609
who's going to believe you? So the one effect
is from the Mother, you take from the Source,

407
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:46,609
for what? To be that illuminated quality,
in you, so that others see you as something

408
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:55,229
great and adore you, worship you.

409
00:48:55,229 --> 00:49:01,880
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be. But now, when you are

410
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,880
dealing with others, know that they are human
beings made by God, not by Sahaja yogis by

411
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:16,199
any chance. And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja
yogis, may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

412
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:23,199
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way. Be kind to them.

413
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:29,589
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people. But as soon as they

414
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:36,589
come, if you say: "Oh, you are a bhoot", the
person will do right-about-turn and go away.

415
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:46,369
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

416
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:57,150
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

417
00:49:57,859 --> 00:50:04,859
gentle, kindly, firm attitude. Only after
Sahaja Yoga you can combine all these qualities.

418
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:12,609
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

419
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:21,559
making fun of others. So then you become a
personality who is alert: to see what is the

420
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,739
reaction they're having on others, this is
very important to be seen. So now you start

421
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:37,739
witnessing others. What is your reaction on
others? I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja

422
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:45,959
yogi comes in. The person is trying to say
something, and the girl starts giggling or

423
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:52,249
laughing. One should not, at that time, because
the person might think that, "They're making

424
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:57,650
fool of me, or they're thinking that I'm a
stupid person, or something wrong with me."

425
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,449
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

426
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:08,449
person. But if somebody is sitting before
Me and I'm trying to help that person, know

427
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:16,150
that it's a very important moment of this
gentleman's life. We have got it, so what?

428
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:25,170
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh? That's

429
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:32,390
the time you have to be very concerned and
very much serious, to do the job. Every quality

430
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:40,589
and mood has its own place, like nose is at
its own place, eyes at its own place. In the

431
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:47,589
same way, all these moods that we have, have
their own places. And that is what is lost

432
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:58,670
in modern society. So when I am trying to
help somebody, you should be all concern about

433
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:06,999
that person. How does this come in to us from
the Source? How much you are concerned about

434
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:15,630
Me? Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel
thirsty. You'll immediately say, "Mother,

435
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:23,219
I'll get You some water." But you may not
even ask Me, just bring it here, keep it there.

436
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:30,219
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me. Do this or do that. In little, little

437
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:36,900
things you should watch. The concern is not
in saying something, asking something. You

438
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:43,900
don't ask. Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

439
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:51,749
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others. So

440
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:58,749
the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

441
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:06,400
have to be alert. Suddenly you say something,
and everybody disappears. You must know they

442
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:12,680
are not yet Sahaja yogis, they are to be brought
in, so you have to very carefully bring them

443
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:19,680
around. Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves
how you behave is extremely important for

444
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:30,499
others to see. We must cherish each other's
company, we must cherish. To meet some Sahaja

445
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,729
yogi somewhere, "Ah, what a joy it is to see
someone, to talk to someone on the phone."

446
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:46,729
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

447
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,900
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

448
00:53:55,779 --> 00:54:02,479
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

449
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:09,479
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company. That means this finger cannot feel

450
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:16,779
this finger. It's like a developing, what
you call, a disease called leprosy. Nerves

451
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:25,660
are finished. Nerve endings are not there.
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

452
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:38,739
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests. When people come

453
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:46,559
in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning, they have
personal interests, like say somebody is trying

454
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:54,519
to sell something, so they would like to sell
it to Sahaja yogis. Or they are arranging

455
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:01,039
something, they would like Sahaja yogis to
do it. See, personal interest, to use Sahaja

456
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:08,039
yogis for their own purposes. As a result
of that I've seen some people become so insular

457
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:15,130
that nobody helps them, no work is done by
them; if there's a telephone, nobody will

458
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:20,380
say, "I'll get it." That's American quality,
they'll say, "I'll get it." Is regarded good.

459
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:27,380
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.
Even when they have eaten the food, they have

460
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:35,289
to pay the money, they'll look this side,
and some poor Indian student will pay for

461
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:42,289
all of them. "I won't look", they say. "Now
paid." Now they are normal. It's very low-level.

462
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:50,349
Is extremely low-level behavior.

463
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:57,349
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

464
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:09,059
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

465
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:18,049
one of My rings of emerald. That's My family
ring so I can't give away, you see, I'll have

466
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:26,209
to ask C.P. and he may not like it, because
after all I have no right on it, I have to

467
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:30,839
give it to My children, all right? But I found
an emerald somewhere, beautiful, so I kept

468
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:36,199
it with Me. The other day when I gave her,
she was so enamored. I said, "You liked My

469
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:38,179
ring, I couldn't give you My ring, so.."

470
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:41,699
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

471
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,319
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it. I

472
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,880
just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

473
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,229
She said, "How thoughtful."

474
00:56:49,229 --> 00:56:56,229
But it's all in My head. I, whenever I get
it, a chance, you see, so somebody says, "Oh,

475
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:06,179
I like it", keep it in mind. Next time, even
a flower. You must cherish their companies,

476
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:13,890
because it's such a great thing to have somebody
who understands you, your spirit, and they

477
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:20,890
have the spirit. Such a great thing. How can
you be unkind to each other? That hurts Me

478
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:29,660
the most of all. And the first thing and the
foremost thing you have to give Me is congenial,

479
00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:38,369
beautiful, loving group, that they love each
other. If that's achieved, that you really

480
00:57:43,979 --> 00:57:50,189
love, beyond your personal considerations.
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are

481
00:57:50,189 --> 00:57:56,429
now not many people who try to make money,
but try to make comfort for themselves. They

482
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:59,989
must have the best room, they must have the
best place, they must have... "I didn't get

483
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:05,410
this, I should have it, this, that." Try to
do more than others. I know sometimes people

484
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:11,400
take advantage of you, but they will go out
of Sahaja Yoga very soon. So be sure that

485
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:18,400
you become generous about it, very generous.
And generosity should start from your own

486
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,880
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

487
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,880
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

488
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:43,229
the sense of chastity. That is a must, whether
you like it or not. There should be no bad

489
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:54,039
intentions about any other person, of relationships
which are not pure. Absolutely pure relationships,

490
00:59:01,219 --> 00:59:08,219
pure eyes without any adultery, adulteration
I would call it. Clean eyes is the basic of

491
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:23,119
Sahaja Yoga. Steadfast clean eyes, because
your eyes are very powerful. You don't know

492
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:35,019
how powerful they are. So to make it that
way, to practice, move your attention inward

493
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:49,039
and towards the Sahasrara. You can. With your
eyes you suck in. Even by looking at Me with

494
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:58,079
the shraddha, with the joy, you just suck
it inside, My image. Put it on your Sahasrara,

495
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:07,479
put it in your heart, you can do it. It's
very joy giving. When you put it in the Sahasrara,

496
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:17,689
then you get the knowledge. When you put it
in your heart, you get the joy; and when you

497
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:24,689
put it on your liver, then you get the power
of action. From the photograph also you can

498
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:34,599
do it, suck in, move it. But that is shown
in the way you behave towards others, completely

499
01:00:37,529 --> 01:00:44,529
confident, gentle; no arrogance. Neither the
neck up like that or like that, but in the

500
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:54,849
center in a very dignified manner.

501
01:00:55,969 --> 01:01:02,969
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

502
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:17,319
of God, you have to judge yourself. "Did I
say something which is not respecting my spirit?

503
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:27,329
Did I do something that is not glorious?"
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll

504
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:34,859
go on asking Me hundred questions. "Should
it be white towel? Green towel? Should I do

505
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:41,859
this, should I do that?" Why? Because we don't
live with choices. We live with whatever we

506
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:52,660
get it, and there is dignity in that. If you
start doing choices, it's stupid. In a group

507
01:01:55,059 --> 01:02:00,789
of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What will you
have?" They'll take forty-five minutes to

508
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:05,179
decide, if you go in a restaurant, because
the first, the consciousness, "We are paying

509
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:11,459
for it", and somebody will have this, somebody
will have that. The poor waiter will run away.

510
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:18,459
But why should we have different? It's just
the same. Whatever Mother is having we'll

511
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:28,910
have, finished. But if not that, at least
whatever everybody is having, "Why have separately?"

512
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:35,539
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly. Choices of this, choices

513
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:42,539
of that, I don't like it, I like that. This
is not good, that is not good. Because we

514
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:49,900
need everything on the level of vibrations,
then the choice is coming. Like, if the vibrations

515
01:02:53,229 --> 01:03:00,229
are not good we'll not say it, but we'll not
have it. But not question of whether green

516
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:08,859
or red or yellow or white. And that is what
they are making fool out of you. They will

517
01:03:11,169 --> 01:03:18,169
put one name, Cartier, finished. People will
pay any amount for that Cartier. Is any ordinary

518
01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:26,719
stuff, it is nothing special. But you see
that ego, "I've got the Cartier. I paid more

519
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:33,630
to show that I've paid more, that I've been
a fool." To pay more for something that's

520
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:40,189
so cheapish; that's what they're playing upon
- remember that.

521
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:47,189
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

522
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:55,589
These things do not give dignity to you. You
give them dignity. But that doesn't mean tomorrow

523
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:06,759
you come like a clown, or like a limbo on
your nose. Of course I must see the other

524
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:15,679
point always, because it just slips out that
side. When you become dignified, you will

525
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:22,789
wear always something that is dignified. You
will do all that is dignified. Is automatically

526
01:04:22,869 --> 01:04:29,869
you become dignified. It's nothing artificial.
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

527
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:42,039
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

528
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:49,039
else. If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.
Somehow I'll return it. A person who is money-oriented

529
01:04:55,569 --> 01:05:00,109
cannot have dignity, because you see him like
a beggar. See, if there’s money-orientation

530
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:04,509
is too much, he comes down to that level,
you can see it, there cannot be dignity there.

531
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:11,509
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot. He
looks like an idiot. So we cannot become idiots.

532
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:20,169
All right. So we cannot be power-oriented.
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,

533
01:05:20,759 --> 01:05:27,759
is a stupid fellow. He behaves like a stupid
fellow. On the street they go on kissing each

534
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:34,469
other all the time. "Where are you going?"
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are

535
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:41,469
thinking of having some kisses." Self-respect
is the thing. Self is your spirit. The respect

536
01:05:45,069 --> 01:05:51,380
of the spirit should give you that dignity.
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,

537
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:58,380
you are gentle with your wife. You must learn
how to be gentle with her in privacy, not

538
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:06,439
in public. That's horrible. Specially in India.
I am told that people go round with that romanticism

539
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:11,529
and all that. So please, don't do all those
romantic stuff in India, it's very embarrassing

540
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:15,140
for Me, very embarrassing.

541
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:21,609
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother. Once you start knowing that, "This

542
01:06:21,609 --> 01:06:26,769
will embarrass Mother, we can't do this",
automatically you are helping. So when it

543
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:33,349
is related with Me, immediately, "What will
Mother think of in me? Is this the way to

544
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:38,809
behave towards Mother?" Immediately you will
get the reward, as that thing working through

545
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:45,809
you, as if you become that nature. Sahaja
culture is a sahaja nature. Automatically

546
01:06:51,419 --> 01:06:58,419
you will do it. You'll talk in that manner,
you will speak in that manner, you’ll live

547
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:05,989
in that manner. I mean, I have seen people
who have never known Me, on a trunk call or

548
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:12,989
a telephone, they recognize. They know I am
something special; if they are sensitive enough.

549
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:18,119
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks. The other

550
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:22,359
day where I went for the meeting with My husband,
everybody was asking, "Who is this lady?"

551
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:29,359
"Who is this lady?" "Who is this lady?" There's
something in the personality. I talk to everyone

552
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:39,369
nicely, I'm very sweet. We cannot be slavish,
and we cannot enslave anyone. We have to cherish,

553
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:49,209
even human beings we have to cherish, because
they are us. Not to despise anyone, not to

554
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:56,529
laugh at anyone. In the culture of Sahaj,
you have to become an expert: expertise. Expertise

555
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:11,009
comes through your adherence to your Mother.
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and

556
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:18,009
who will give you the certificate is your
Mother only - who else? I may not say so,

557
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:23,880
but your spirit will say that, and not your
ego.

558
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:30,159
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

559
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:36,949
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

560
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:43,599
manner. So I've given you very synthesis of
the whole thing. "Analytical" would be one,

561
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:50,599
two, three, four, five - cut short - two,
three, four, five, like that. It's not like

562
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:57,289
that. And that is how you have to speak to
people. One, this is so; two, this is so;

563
01:08:57,289 --> 01:09:04,289
three, this is so; finished. You are not Sahaja
yogis. In your speeches if you talk like that,

564
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:12,559
finished. But before saying something or doing
something, give a little idea where you are

565
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:20,969
leading the people, so they are not frittered
away, attention is not frittered away. Give

566
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:28,089
a little idea, as I say, or else while talking,
bring them to a point which is important,

567
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:39,469
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point. But make the whole sentence

568
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:46,650
look so, that it is going towards certain
points, so always a Sahaja yogi must make

569
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:53,900
a point out of what they talk, not just babbling,
talking. What is the point you are going to

570
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:03,300
make? Whatever they do, they have to know,
"What are we going to achieve out of it?"

571
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,030
Now, marriage. "What are we going to achieve
out of marriage?" A family, house, everybody

572
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:16,030
has, even a donkey has that. What's so great?
We are going to achieve a family unit where

573
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:22,270
realized souls are to be born, we're going
to look after them in a proper way, and then

574
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:29,270
we are going to emit that unit into this world,
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful

575
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:42,219
setting of a family, giving light to the whole
world.

576
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:49,219
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

577
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:59,480
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

578
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:10,369
is not at all difficult. If you can get rid
of ego and superego, finished, that's all

579
01:11:12,609 --> 01:11:19,609
- simple as that.
May God bless you all.

580
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:32,570
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh? Relaxed. Witness.
Everyone cleared out, I think. And no more…

581
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:56,409
one more thing I must say last, as I've said
it before, which I've not said here, no-one

582
01:11:56,409 --> 01:12:01,639
is going to say that bhoot did it, because
such a person will be sent away to the bhoot

583
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:08,639
clan, not to Sahaja Yoga. Don't put your responsibility
on the bhoots. Either you are a bhoot or you

584
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,860
are a Sahaja yogi, one of the two, you can't
be both.
