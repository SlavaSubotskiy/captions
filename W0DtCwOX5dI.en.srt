1
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,520
They are transformed.

2
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,440
Exeter has a speciality I don't know why with this kind

3
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,280
and I'm really amazed that I've been here three times

4
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,240
and people have not taken up life seriously.

5
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240
They are not taken up

6
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,520
the purpose for which they are born.

7
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,360
It's a sad thing I feel,

8
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,760
but again I wanted to try

9
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,680
that maybe you people will be able to realize

10
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,880
how important it is to get your self-realization.

11
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,880
Already they must have told you about your Kundalini,

12
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
the power that works out

13
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,120
this miracle of your second birth

14
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,200
It's already being done by God.

15
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,320
He's put everything down there it's all there.

16
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
You are just ready for it.

17
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,040
But you must have the desire.

18
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,960
You must have an ardent desire.

19
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,400
There cannot be any realization for a person

20
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,400
or any development for a person

21
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,600
if the person doesn't desire it.

22
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Your desire is the most important thing.

23
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,280
And you will be amazed that even the Kundalini about which we are talking

24
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,720
is nothing but your primal desire

25
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,040
the power of your primal desire

26
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,040
because all other desires are transitory

27
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,760
- are absolutely temporary -

28
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,840
and they fizzle out.

29
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,160
You want to have a house? Alright you can have a house,

30
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,360
then you want to have something else and then something else.

31
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,800
Economic wants are never sessiable,

32
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
So you go on asking for this and that,

33
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
then you go to politics for power,

34
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,600
you try to have some emotional experiences,

35
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,360
all these are transitory

36
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,680
and they all vanish into thin air

37
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
while the joy of the Spirit is the permanent

38
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,760
but people who are not desiring it

39
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
are asking for frivolous things

40
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,840
and things that are of no value at all I tell you

41
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,640
it is of no value to have all these things

42
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
because you are so affluent already

43
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,120
still there is no joy there's no happiness,

44
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,120
there is no peace in the family there's no bliss.

45
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,240
So we have to achieve that which is permanent,

46
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,920
which is eternal,

47
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,880
which is promised to us.

48
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,240
You have been very carefully made into this being

49
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
The human being is the epitome of the creation

50
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
but how far do we value ourselves,

51
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,200
our human existence?

52
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,800
Do we realize that thousands of years

53
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,720
the nature has worked to make us human beings

54
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,120
and that at this time when you have to just become the spirit

55
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,680
we are hesitating

56
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,920
we still are dominated by desires

57
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
which are not the primary desires.

58
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,920
Normally when the Kundalini awakens

59
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,200
a person definitely gets transformed

60
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,840
and he gets the power to get over

61
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,680
all the nonsensical ideas about life

62
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
all this misidentifications drop out

63
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,280
I have known so many cases

64
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,320
we had a boy who came from some

65
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,320
pub I think and he was shouting at me

66
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,600
but screaming at me and he was very very funny

67
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,440
but he got his realization

68
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,040
lucky he got his realization

69
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,840
from next day he gave up everything

70
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,640
there was no alcoholism the problem which doctors cannot solve

71
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,640
nobody can treat him.

72
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,920
There are so many who were suffering

73
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
from diseases which were absolutely incurable

74
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
just got all right.

75
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
That is physical side,

76
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,080
so many emotional problems like people who were mad lunatic got cured

77
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,000
but the spiritual problem is the main problem

78
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,400
where people go to fake gurus and fake people

79
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,200
pay them lots of money run like mad

80
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,080
and then they come back and find that they

81
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,400
that was a fake guru and they give up.

82
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,040
But why? Why do like the fake guru so much

83
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,360
and not Sahaja Yoga?

84
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,480
We should find out why. Why is it that the fake gurus

85
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,720
in this Exeter we had a fake guru

86
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,280
who had thousands of disciples

87
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,920
and why for Sahaja yoga we can't get people?

88
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,560
The reason is say plain and simple.

89
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,200
I was told that this gentleman

90
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,680
who was supposed to be the Guru

91
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
used to drink,

92
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
used to have women,

93
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,480
do all kinds of things

94
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,600
and every disciple was allowed to have

95
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,320
any kind of unrighteous life that they wanted.

96
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,120
Because no power was given to the disciples.

97
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,560
Only they had one power is to pay to this horrible man.

98
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
That's all the power they had

99
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,280
and they thought that we can purchase this guru,

100
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,360
we can buy this man and by buying this man we are something.

101
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,520
Oh, there's another one who talks that you will become great,

102
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
you have to be very great, Christ was nothing,

103
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,218
you are going to become very great.

104
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,320
All such talks sometimes really pamper our ego

105
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
and we get driven to that.

106
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,880
One should know that one has to be real

107
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
and honest.

108
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,200
If you are not honest to yourself,

109
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,320
how can anybody else make it?

110
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,800
You have to be honest yourself first of all,

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,120
that you must know that you want the reality.

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,000
And if you want the reality was no you cannot pay for it.

113
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
You cannot pay for it.

114
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,840
You have to become - you have to become that.

115
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,680
That becoming is not so difficult.

116
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,800
I tell you it is not at all difficult

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,440
because so many people who have got realization in England

118
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
they are are in thousands and they are doing very well

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,240
they are beautiful people, they are all realized Souls

120
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,280
and they know how to handle the Kundalini.

121
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
They also cure people.

122
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,360
Not only that but their lives are changed that patterns are changed

123
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,400
they are very happy joyous people.

124
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,240
This has to happen

125
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,040
the time has come of your resurrection.

126
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
The whole of humanity has to rise to it.

127
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,760
This is the only solution that you can think of for all the turmoils,

128
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,320
all the destruction that is facing us today.

129
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,320
But do we realize that we are playing a part in their destruction,

130
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,120
if you do not take to this lift.

131
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
This lift is very important in our lives and we have to do it.

132
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,960
I do not know why but

133
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,520
it is really surprising

134
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,600
why people do not want to become themselves.

135
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
To be the self is the master.

136
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,720
You are the master of yourself.

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
You have to be the master of yourself

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,360
and not of some sort of silly ideas and stupid things.

139
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,040
If you become the master naturally nothing can dominate you.

140
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
You become the free bird,

141
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
you become absolutely on top of everything

142
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,000
and you can see everything as just a drama and a witness.

143
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,480
All this is within you.

144
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
All these powers are within you because the Spirit is within.

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,680
The Kundalini is within.

146
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,520
You have to adjust.

147
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,280
First of all get your realization,

148
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
enlightenment and maintain it for a while

149
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
and you don't need much effort

150
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,960
because after realization you are really empowered.

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,840
You get over your frivolities.

152
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
You get over your stupidities

153
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,280
and you get over all these nagging habits that put you down

154
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,600
your self-respect and everything.

155
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Now it is easy for people to go

156
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,960
to any you know whatsoever because you don't have to do anything.

157
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,400
You just have to go pay some money and you become the disciple.

158
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,200
The guru who doesn't do anything he doesn't even travel.

159
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,360
He doesn't do anything. He sits nicely.

160
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,200
You go and give you money and he enjoys your money and he's a parasite.

161
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,160
But here you are the guru, you have to become the guru.

162
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Here you have to become the self, you have to be the guru,

163
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,040
which is the principle already in you

164
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,600
it is to be enlightened.

165
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,840
You cannot depend on anyone.

166
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,480
You have to depend on yourself

167
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,520
and you are already entitle and empower to be that.

168
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,840
Sahaja. Sahaja means: born with you.

169
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Saha is with - born with you.

170
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,120
This power to be united with the divine is with you.

171
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,200
It is within you.

172
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,040
And the time has come. This is the Blossom time.

173
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,000
And this time you have to get it.

174
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
If you lack behind you have to face the problems.

175
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,160
You have to face the problems lateron.

176
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,480
So those who call themselves as seekers,

177
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,575
those who say that we are seeking God, we are seeking the truth, must know

178
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:18,858
that to see the truth is to see the truth within themselves and not without.

179
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:21,440
If somebody says that, "You are going to fly in the air.

180
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,880
You have to see the stars and  the moons."

181
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
That's not way. It is within yourself.

182
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,120
You have to see what you are

183
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,920
and when you start feeling your spirit you start feeling others also.

184
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,040
Because your spirit is the collective being.

185
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,600
You have to become that. Again I say: "You have to become that spirit."

186
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,320
So far your spirit is just watching you.

187
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,520
It doesn't come into the play.

188
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,600
It doesn't come into the play.

189
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,440
It is still there in a state we can call as a witness.

190
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,760
He is witnessing all that you are doing.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But once the Kundalini rises from its base,

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,360
there as you see in the triangular bone,

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,800
it comes up, breaks through

194
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,920
and you start felling the existence of spirit

195
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,120
on your nervous system.

196
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,840
You can feel it in your hands.

197
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,840
It is so simple that even children can feel it.

198
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,000
Say for example, in this room you have to put a light.

199
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,840
Just you have to press one button and you get the light.

200
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
But it's not so simple.

201
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
To look at it look simple,

202
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,600
it looks absolutely life.

203
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,200
If you tell a villager, the one who has never seen how electricity works,

204
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,040
he won't believe it. He won't believe that this is possible.

205
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,320
It is so naive for his mind also that how can it be?

206
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,400
Just you press the button and you get the light.

207
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,720
But you do with the light and how

208
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,720
because there is a mechanism here.

209
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
There is an organization behind it.

210
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Then it's a history behind and there is an evolution behind it.

211
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Now we are standing at the last part of our evolution.

212
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,960
The human awareness that it is today

213
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,280
is still not complete.

214
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,160
If it was we would not have been so much confused.

215
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,960
We are confused because our awareness has not reached that stage

216
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,560
where we become the spirit.

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
Christ has said you are to be born again.

218
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Now there are people I have heard the other day the

219
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,840
one gentleman came and started talking just like a tape recorder

220
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,440
that Christ was just a Kundalini yogi and all that thing.

221
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,760
Who are they to judge Christ? What do they know about him?

222
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,814
What is their power to judge him.

223
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:30,640
You see, any big Tom and Harry stands up and start talking about anyone.

224
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
First of all let us know: "What is your power?"

225
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Let's see what do you know about it.

226
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,120
Have do you found yourself?

227
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,800
Please be honest about it.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,560
Please be honest. That's all is needed.

229
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,680
Because the whole nature,

230
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,360
the whole creation,

231
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,560
all the pervading power of God's love

232
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
is trying to do this for you.

233
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,560
Everyone is trying to. I sometimes feel  people are pampered

234
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,730
because the way I see these days miracles happening

235
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,800
to thousands of people getting realization.

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
I am myself amazed

237
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,280
how the Divine itself

238
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,960
has taken upon itself

239
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
to give this realization to you,

240
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,320
to give this experience to you,

241
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,080
to do this for you.

242
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
It is something so remarkable.

243
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,600
The whole compassion is working out this great work,

244
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,080
this great drama of giving realizations to you.

245
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,960
Of course if you are not a seeker you will take time.

246
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,640
I mean you can teach people to see. You have to be hungry.

247
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,920
If you are not seeking it's not easy.

248
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,520
I know it is very difficult.

249
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,880
And if you are not seeking you will take I think some time to do it.

250
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,280
Some people who are not seeking

251
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
also when they see so many coming to Sahaja Yoga

252
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,920
getting cured, having a better life,

253
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,960
enjoying themselves becoming such good people also follow them

254
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,440
but those who are seekers do not wait for any such things.

255
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,960
They just jump into it, get it and become that.

256
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,600
Are we going to waste our human life?

257
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
Are we not going to be what we are meant for?

258
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,240
For example see this instrument is made with such difficulties

259
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,320
and with such care

260
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,760
but if you do not put this to the mains,

261
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,280
what's the use?

262
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
What's the use of this instrument?

263
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,520
Is it's a waste? It's just a waste.

264
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,680
And that's what one should know that you should put it to the mains

265
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,640
and put into the mains itself means getting realization.

266
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,720
Yoga means union with the Divine.

267
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,400
The divine power that is all-pervading.

268
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,720
This divine power is there,

269
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,240
we can see its effects.

270
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,640
All the living work is done by that power.

271
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,800
A flower becomes a fruit through that power,

272
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,640
we exist because of that power.

273
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,800
If you see these eyes how beautifully God made,

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,640
how beautifully he has made us.

275
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,840
All that is done by this God's loving power

276
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
which is all-pervading. It is very subtle.

277
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,680
You cannot feel it

278
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
because with this awareness we are not yet that subtle.

279
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Only after realization you can feel that power

280
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,480
and you start feeling it as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

281
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
That should happen to all of you.

282
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,280
Even if it happens you must keep the connection all right.

283
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
If you are loosely connected,

284
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,800
if you do not put in effort to keep the connection on

285
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
sometimes it drops out.

286
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,000
And that's what I find people become extremely critical

287
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,760
and extremely high-handed.

288
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,120
They think that why should I do thi,s why should I do this?

289
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
Because that is how you keep the connection.

290
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,680
You will be amazed that in India thousands of people have got realization in the village

291
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
Thousands and in this Exeter how many people are fine today? Three!

292
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,840
You are lagging behind. I am telling you're lagging behind.

293
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,760
Once I go to America, I know,  Americans will take to it very fast

294
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,000
because they are fed up of guru shopping, they are absolutely tired of it.

295
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,760
They don't want to talk about it

296
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,720
and they want to have self-realization.

297
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,360
But here what are we doing?

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,160
You can imagine that thousands of people have already got realization.

299
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,840
They are transformed, while people otherwise

300
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,120
who are too much critical, think too much about it, do not get it.

301
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
But we must come to logical conclusions.

302
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,960
Without coming to logical conclusion you should not jump on to anything blindly.

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
That's absolutely wrong.

304
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,160
Use your brains I say.

305
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,200
Like today the gentleman at the BBC asked me that:

306
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,760
"How is it many people are going to these fake gurus

307
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,560
and paying them such a lot of money?"

308
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,320
I said they should use their brains! What has happened to their brains?

309
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
Why don't they use their brains?

310
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,720
First of all you cannot pay for God's love.

311
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,280
That's simple, very simple as that.

312
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,880
You cannot pay for His love.

313
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,560
You have never paid.

314
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
You never paid for becoming human beings.

315
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,000
You never paid for getting a flower into a fruit.

316
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,800
You cannot pay for all these things.

317
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,120
Secondly you cannot put in any effort for a spontaneous thing.

318
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,200
Whatever is living happens spontaneously,

319
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,680
this is a living process of the Living God.

320
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
So, come to right conclusion,

321
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,000
that if anything has to happen to us it has to happen within,

322
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,600
it has to happen in a way where we do not put in any effort,

323
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,640
where we do not pay.

324
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,160
Minimum of minimum this much we should understand

325
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,160
that this cannot be.

326
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,480
Then the person who talks of God of divine love and things,

327
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,800
if he is interested in your purse,

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,640
if he's interested in your women,

329
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,640
who leads an unrighteous life

330
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,760
he has no business to be a guru,

331
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,511
he has no business to be there.

332
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:44,200
Then we have to come to another conclusion -

333
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
 very positively: We are seekers.

334
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,360
We are seekers of truth.

335
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,760
We are seeking God.

336
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,296
We are seeking the divine

337
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:54,551
and unless until we find it we are not going to rest.

338
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,679
We have to find it at any cost.

339
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,800
You might have done lots of mistakes, I know.

340
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,280
In seeking people have done lots of mistake. They have gone to wrong places,

341
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,440
they have been hit, people had epilepsy, they had all kinds of things.

342
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,440
I know that. Doesn't matter!

343
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,360
All these things can be corrected and improved.

344
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,720
Because as I told you:

345
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,680
The divine power itself, the divinity itself,

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,920
God himself wants to save his creation

347
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,000
because you are the epitome of his creation.

348
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,480
He wants to give you this,

349
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,440
but it is not because you live in a particular place

350
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,840
and if you are arrogant or egoistical

351
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,920
or if you are afraid that he is going to bother about you.

352
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,520
For him the whole race of human beings is just the same.

353
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,560
If you are a human being you can get your realization.

354
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,720
That's all is wanted that you have to be a human being.

355
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,080
And the second is the people who are really seeking get it very fast.

356
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Some people get it very fast and also lose it very fast,

357
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
because they do not understand the value of that.

358
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,480
The idea that we have to suffer for spirituality

359
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,920
is absolutely out of take and absolutely out of any context.

360
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,640
Because if you know Christ has suffered for us,

361
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,400
he has suffered for us,

362
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,040
and people said that once he has suffered for us

363
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,680
he sucks in our sins,

364
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
he sucks in our Karmas,

365
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,560
then why are you suffering? Why do you want to suffer?

366
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
Has he not suffered sufficiently?

367
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
He is to be awakened within you. That's what it is.

368
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,040
Once he's awakened within you he sucks in.

369
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,720
As you can see clearly there at the point here,

370
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,880
where it is between the optic chiasma

371
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,560
near the pituitary and the pineal body is placed this subtle Center

372
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,160
which when awakened

373
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,600
sucks in the ego and superego under the sides.

374
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,560
So everything will be forgiven.

375
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:46,400
There's nothing to worry about the past, nothing to feel guilty.

376
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Everything can be worked out so easily.

377
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
If the Kundalini is allowed to rise it can suck in.

378
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,320
Once the center is awakened there's no problem at all

379
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,880
and you get your realization quite all right.

380
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,320
Today I was surprised that at BBC this thing

381
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,280
the gentlemen both of them the producer

382
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,960
and the director both of them got realization.

383
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,720
It's such a good thing to see

384
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,960
that those people who are not so much concerned with spirit

385
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,800
and not concerned with spiritual ascent got the realization.

386
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,040
I was really enamored, I was so very happy about it.

387
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,080
I mean there are people and people who get realised no doubt

388
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,320
like in India, I would say that people understand

389
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,320
who is a real guru and who is not.

390
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Because they are not lying about it.

391
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,908
This is the knowledge about the roots.

392
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:38,520
While you know about the shoot, you don't know what the roots,

393
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,094
while they know about the roots.

394
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,571
They know what it is,

395
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,840
how to find it, what happens and how you achieve it.

396
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,720
Everyone knows about Kundalini.

397
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,080
You won't find any Indian who doesn't know about Kundalini.

398
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Maybe they are westernized. Westernized I can't say.

399
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,760
But everyone knows it is the Kundalini awakening

400
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,880
by which you get your realization.

401
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,800
So now I have to request again to all of you living in Exeter.

402
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,040
I have a feeling that Exeter has lots of seekers

403
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,960
but they're somehow lost somewhere.

404
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
I don't know what's happening to them

405
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
and I'm very much concerned

406
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,080
because maybe next time I may not be able to come here.

407
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,640
I come all the way from London just to see them and what I find

408
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,280
that they just take realization and finish off.

409
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,440
It's a very sad thing and it should be so peculiar of this place

410
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,520
that I can't understand what's the reason,

411
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,480
why it happens.

412
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,000
I went to Vienna where

413
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,760
sixty people got realization in first shot

414
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,080
and they are increasing.

415
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,920
Every country is like that. Switzerland, if you go,

416
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,480
there are at least thousand people who have got realization.

417
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,960
Of course London because I have been there for eight years,

418
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,800
so you can imagine there are lots of people who have got realization.

419
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,760
But one has to know that after getting realization

420
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
you should not just sit back and say no nothing doing.

421
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,520
You have to see that your connection is established

422
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,640
for which all the knowledge will be given to you

423
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,720
and you see that you retain the position.

424
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,960
It's a very small thing that is to be done.

425
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,440
If you really respect yourself, your life

426
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,800
as such as a human being

427
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
as much as I respect it

428
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,880
as much as I love.

429
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,680
I am sure even one thousandth of that

430
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
if you could understand what you are you would do it

431
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,520
because you are nothing but the spirit,

432
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,320
the spirit which is the joy the spirit which is the attention

433
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,440
and the spirit that is the complete beauty

434
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,240
this is what you have to be

435
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,720
you don't call yourself ugly

436
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,200
or don't feel at all unhappy that you haven't got this or that

437
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
no inadequacy

438
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,080
and no guilt.

439
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,080
Nothing is going to stop you from getting realization.

440
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,320
This is a day when I feel something should happen here

441
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,960
also again and that people should really rise

442
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
about petty things

443
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
and get to themselves

444
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,320
and develop their realization.

445
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,200
Rome, imagine Rome a place like Rome we have so many Sahaja Yogis

446
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
and here is somebody who has come

447
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,200
now we are importing people from outside to come to Exeter

448
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,040
because so many people in London got really fed up

449
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,840
they just don't know what to do with the people in Exeter.

450
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,320
Why, why are they not serious about their lives?

451
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,760
So I would request you today please, for heaven's sake

452
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,800
try to get your realization and establish yourself.

453
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,320
Thank you very much! May God bless you!

454
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,000
Will you please ask me questions. If there are any, I would like to answer them,

455
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,720
but ask questions which are relevant

456
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,240
and not somebody gurus as this and that.

457
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,680
You see if you have got to say something

458
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,560
you should find your own halls and say

459
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,640
but not to represent here some guru.

460
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,312
If he has given you something why here?

461
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,902
Is a simple thing as that.

462
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:46,062
I would like you to ask me questions which are relevant and sensible.

463
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,480
No questions?

464
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,182
Yes please!

465
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:06,376
Seeker: Isn't the Kundalini a natural evolutionary process (inaudible)

466
00:27:06,576 --> 00:27:11,640
when a person reaches a certain point (inaudible) evolution (inaudible).

467
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,240
Shri Mtataji: Yes it's true

468
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,600
I agree, agreed with you that evolution happens up to the human stage,

469
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,560
up to the human stage spontaneously is true,

470
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,560
but at the stage of human beings, you see,

471
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,320
we are specially made because we have lifted our head

472
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,960
and this I-ness has come in to us, you see?

473
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,080
The animals don't have that I-ness we have that I-ness.

474
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,600
And because of that happening, what happens?

475
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,240
That it the ego and superego meet here and get calcified

476
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,200
and you become mister X, you become mister Y.

477
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,520
So your awareness is very different from that of an animal.

478
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,360
And in this awareness you must get that you have got your realization.

479
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,000
If you don't get it you cannot use it.

480
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,640
It cannot be like an animal to human being.

481
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,400
It has to be of a

482
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,760
of a nature that you know about it, you are aware of it.

483
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,680
If you are not aware that you have got your realization,

484
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,760
then you won't be able to use it further.

485
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,488
That's why this is important that you should get it in your awareness.

486
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,973
Very good question, I must say!

487
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:18,800
Seeker: Too many books advising to do special breathing exercies.

488
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,680
Shri Mataji: But breathing exercise...

489
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,400
Seeker:  yet other books say...

490
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,520
Shri Mattaji: Yes, I agree with you. It's very confusing.

491
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,240
You are all right. It's very confusing I agree with you, you see.

492
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Whatever people say you shouldn't believe it.

493
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,902
Now, you must see for you...

494
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:33,458
Even what I say, you should not believe but keep yourself open.

495
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:34,320
All right?

496
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,680
Now, some say, you should do breathing exercise.

497
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,360
Now,  you should think about it!

498
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
You see by breathing, it's a living process.

499
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,376
What I said, you come to right conclusion that evolutionary process is a living process, all right?

500
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:47,651
So for living process,

501
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,440
supposing you have to sow a seed, all right?

502
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,040
What do you do? You take a seed and put it in the mother earth

503
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,920
When you put it in the mother earth, she has the capacity to sprout it, all right?

504
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,160
But supposing you... breathing exercises you do or do what ever you like,

505
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,680
it won't, it won't come up.

506
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,800
It will only come up if the person who has authority to enlighten you

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,160
can enlighten you

508
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,015
and then once you're enlightened you can enlighten another person.

509
00:29:12,215 --> 00:29:14,975
So that you can verify whether you are enlightened or not.

510
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,680
You can see with your naked eyes

511
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,040
the pulsation of the Kundalini,

512
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,600
the rising of the Kundalini.

513
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,960
You can. You can feel it with the stethoscope.

514
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,181
It comes up on your head here and it breaks.

515
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:27,760
When it breaks there the sound stops.

516
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,200
You can hear (lab da)

517
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,823
just like the heart beat going up

518
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:35,390
and it breaks up here and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head,

519
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,302
But the transformation starts working out gradually within you,

520
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:40,547
which you start seeing and you can verify it.

521
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:45,152
So, you see - if you say that it is spontaneous, it should happen

522
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,040
but at this stage it cannot,

523
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,040
because you have to enter into the kingdom of God.

524
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,720
You are special people, so you have to be aware of it.

525
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,960
You should know that now I'm here everyone.

526
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,400
We never knew till, till now Darwin put up this theory that we are have evolved, isn't it.

527
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,200
We never knew that we have evolved from amoeba to this stage.

528
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
That was all right but today you have to know,

529
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,440
because that is the blessing of God which you should know.

530
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,630
And you should know everything, not only that,

531
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,280
but you should know what are these centers.

532
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,391
How they work out,

533
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:14,575
how you can handle them,

534
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:15,831
how can arrange them,

535
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,342
how can you give realization,

536
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,040
how can you raise other's Kundalini. Everything you have to know

537
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,200
Absolutely without paying anything.

538
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,720
All this knowledge you have to have.

539
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,640
Now for breathing. Somebody says you do breathing exercise.

540
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,240
Now, that is also one has to do sometimes in Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,200
But in Sahaja Yoga the first thing is the awakening of the Kundalini.

542
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,760
Because supposing you have a problem

543
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,600
of the center heart, as they call it.

544
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,280
Now here you see the green one

545
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,680
and the yellow one there's another center there.

546
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,957
The green, you see, this green and that green

547
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:49,640
there is another bluish center, if you see that center one.

548
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,400
If that is out of order,

549
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,120
then you have to do a kind of a breathing exercise.

550
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
If that is out of order.

551
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,596
Not otherwise.

552
00:30:57,796 --> 00:31:01,600
You see, it is the way we are doing everything is indiscriminate.

553
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,880
We try to do something which is not necessary

554
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,120
or which is which has no relationship

555
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
to our troubles for our weaknesses.

556
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,360
It is like supposing, now I have to go to London.

557
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,800
Now, I don't know how the traffic is going to be on the way, all right?

558
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
So I, I before hand,

559
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,720
if I started pushing for the traffic is absurd

560
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,280
because I am not yet facing it.

561
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,800
When the Kundalini moves then only you will know

562
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,080
where the problem is

563
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
and then you should try to solve it.

564
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,400
If it is at a lower, lower centers

565
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,840
or at the higher centers you have to do something else.

566
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,160
All the exercises that are told

567
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,760
in the path Anjali Yoga Shastra

568
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,080
are just a wee bit of the whole thing.

569
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,120
There are Astangas there are eight Angas of the yoga.

570
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,640
Out of that one

571
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,480
one of them has got Yama-Niyama,

572
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,520
out of which one-third are the exercises.

573
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,240
These exercises only correct the backbone

574
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,760
the physical side of it,

575
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,200
not the subtler side of it.

576
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,320
So, when you just start looking after your health

577
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,120
or say your physical side you neglect your emotional side.

578
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,040
A person who looks after his health too much

579
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,760
can be a very dry person - absolutely feelingless.

580
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
He can become absolutely feelingless.

581
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,960
If somebody dies you won't feel anything, anything. "I become a great saint."

582
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,480
But he'll be a hot-tempered fellow,

583
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,760
extremely hot-tempered.

584
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
You can't go near him.

585
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
If you go near and very much he may bark or may bite you.

586
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,280
So that sort of a thing might happen.

587
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,920
So you have to understand, in complete integration,

588
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,400
where is the problem,

589
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,920
what is the problem

590
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
and what is the treatment needed?

591
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,000
But once it happens to you, then only you will know.

592
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,320
You can verify it, one after another.

593
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,720
So this is what it is. You have to know about it.

594
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Everything you must know, why you are doing what.

595
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,480
This, why you have to do it,

596
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,400
what is the need to do this, what is to need to do that.

597
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,880
But if somebody tells you: "Just do this!

598
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,800
Stand on your heads!" You start doing that.

599
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,760
Why? Why should we stand on our heads?

600
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,680
What is the need to stand on our heads?

601
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,200
Everything should be logical, as I said,

602
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,635
but once you get your realization

603
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:14,640
the whole thing becomes so logical,

604
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,481
because you start understanding the laws of the Divine.

605
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,840
Once you understand those laws, then you know,

606
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,080
by doing what, you get what.

607
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,320
For example leukemia. A disease like leukemia,

608
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,920
we have cured

609
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,320
and we can cure leucemia a very easily.

610
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,440
Cancer can be cured also.

611
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,520
Now how leucemia is caused?

612
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Perhaps people do not know.

613
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,800
Is caused because a person is very hasty very speedy.

614
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,243
Very is ( ) sort of ( ).

615
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:45,255
In the morning he takes his breakfast in his hand,

616
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:46,480
sits on his car

617
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,400
and all the time  is, you seen, in a haste, going for his work

618
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,080
and there's a jam on the way and he's absolutely upset.

619
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
This spleen which is on the left-hand side,

620
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,600
you see, has to produce red blood corpuscles for your emergencies

621
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,200
and it becomes crazy, it becomes absolutely crazy.

622
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,720
It doesn't know what to do with the person who's doing three, four simultaneously (inaudible).

623
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,960
When it becomes crazy the situation is created.

624
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,560
The situation for leukemia is created.

625
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,200
And if it is triggered

626
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
as a doctor they call it -

627
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,800
they call it as protein 58, protein 52.

628
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,840
Because doctors are honest they don't want to say more than what they know.

629
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,520
But when we know, we can tell you, that what it is.

630
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,920
They say that these proteins entered into us

631
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,800
and they triggered the cancer.

632
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,760
Now what are these proteins?

633
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,440
They say that they come from an area which is built with us since our creation.

634
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,520
We call it as collective subconscious.

635
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,160
All those things you will know,

636
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,200
how they trigger,

637
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,640
how they come in and what happens to you.

638
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,720
It is very simple to understand

639
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,680
because here we are dealing with the principles which created.

640
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,160
Once it gets out of principles

641
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,600
then it gets on, you see, complicated.

642
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,600
But if you know how to handle the principle,

643
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,440
you can correct it and can manage it.

644
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,560
It is a fact.

645
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
You can verify it yourself.

646
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,480
And you have to verify it, keep your mind open and see for yourself.

647
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,960
All right, thank you.

648
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,320
Should we have the experience now?

649
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,440
All right!

650
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,080
But you all have to promise me that I will work it out

651
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,720
but you must continue with it.

652
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
You should not just give it that way,

653
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,560
because that's not good that's very, very sad.

654
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
As Christ has said a parable

655
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,080
that some seeds fell on the rocks.

656
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,960
I saw a beautiful red rocks near Exeter.

657
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,320
I hope also there is very beautiful soil,

658
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,000
which is red and nice.

659
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,520
I saw very good barley fields and other fields.

660
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,080
I hope there are people

661
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,400
who will receive realization

662
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,160
as sprout into beautiful trees of Sahaja Yoga.

663
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,880
May God bless you.

664
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,400
You have to just, now again I'll tell you,

665
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,760
you have to do few things which are simple.

666
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You have to take out your shoes.

667
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,480
For one reason that the mother earth helps us

668
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,920
to suck in the problem, you see?

669
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,560
So just take out your shoes.

670
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,400
Nothing extraordinary has to be done.

671
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,160
Those people can come forward.

672
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,280
How are you today? Are you feeling all right?

673
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,920
This gentleman.

674
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,240
Are you all right?

675
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,480
How are you feeling?

676
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,920
You came!

677
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,600
Seeker: Yeah

678
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,440
Shri Mataji: How are you?

679
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Seeker: I try again.

680
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,640
Shri Mataji: All right.

681
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,835
Just put your hands like this.

682
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:01,035
It's your own.

683
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,068
I mean you should be cheerful about, absolutely cheerful.

684
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:08,143
It is just there. You've to find it. That is all.

685
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:11,664
This is your property which you are going to have.

686
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,480
There's no obligation, nothing.

687
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,200
It's just your own.

688
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,136
Be cheerful about it!

689
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,646
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing is going to happen.

690
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:20,894
It's very simple.

691
00:37:21,094 --> 00:37:23,816
Just put your hands like this.

692
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:27,672
Close your eyes! Please close your eyes.

693
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,552
Now don't open your eyes still I tell you, because

694
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,392
the Kundalini doesn't rise above a certain center of Agnya

695
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,800
if your eyes are open out, so please keep them closed.

696
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,920
This just see, this is against hypnotism

697
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,293
where they put some spirits through eyes.

698
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,143
So keep your eyes shut.

699
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:49,400
Because there is dilatation of the pupil when the Kundalini rises

700
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,717
and if the Kundalini is the eyes are not closed it stops at a point.

701
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:55,031
So just help yourself.

702
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,840
Little bit cooperate with me and it will work out.

703
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,240
I am sure it will work out.

704
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,400
Just cooperate with me a little bit.

705
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,240
Put both the hands towards me.

706
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,360
Just like this, put both the hands.

707
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,600
If you have anything tight on your body you can loosen it a little bit

708
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,080
and be comfortable. You have to be comfortable.

709
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,120
If anything tight on your body just loosen it, if possible.

710
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,400
Put both the hands towards me.

711
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,360
Just like that.

712
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,535
Keep your eyes shut please.

713
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,000
Now the first thing I have to request you,

714
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
that you have to say:

715
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,840
"Mother, I am not guilty."

716
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,720
This you say it, at least three times.

717
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,960
With complete confidence,

718
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,400
with complete belief in yourself that you are not guilty.

719
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,920
Because whatever guilt you think of, it's just a speck.

720
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm talking about God

721
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,040
who is the ocean of love,

722
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,120
the ocean of compassion,

723
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,280
ocean of forgiveness.

724
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Whatever you have done just forget it

725
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
and say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

726
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,800
First of all you must respect yourself.

727
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,280
If you don't respect yourself it's not going to work out.

728
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,080
Just say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

729
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,040
Three times to say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

730
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,094
Already some people must have started feeling the cool breeze.

731
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:31,414
Today vibrations are too much.

732
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,400
Now you put your right hand on your heart.

733
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,840
Now ask me a question

734
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,560
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

735
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,440
Ask me a question thrice please.

736
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
Just ask me a question with confidence:

737
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,640
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

738
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,640
Now bring that hand down.

739
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,720
You have already started feeling the cool breeze?

740
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,160
Down below - you bring that hand down below on the left hand side on your stomach.

741
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,960
Now here at this point

742
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
you have to say, ask a question again:

743
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,542
"Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?"

744
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,760
Because you are!

745
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,840
But just ask the question.

746
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,120
By asking the question the center starts working.

747
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,360
In a humble way, please ask in a humble way

748
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,760
"Mother, am I my own guru?"

749
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,120
Now raise it again, the hand, to your heart

750
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,600
and say: "Mother, I am the spirit."

751
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,200
Now say it 12 times.

752
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,360
With full confidence.

753
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,760
With full confidence say it: "Mother, I am the spirit."

754
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,880
Now put this right hand on the left-hand side of your neck.

755
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,920
Now say: "Mother, I am not guilty."

756
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,400
Say it sixteen times

757
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,840
because this is the punishment for feeling guilty.

758
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,174
It is the worst center all of you have got.

759
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:15,374
I don't know why you sit down and start feeling guilty for nothing at all.

760
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,280
Now put your right hand again across your forehead,

761
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,960
across your forehead.

762
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,880
And just say one thing twice:

763
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,240
"Mother," - genuinely honestly -

764
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,600
"I forgive everyone."

765
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,520
You have to be honest. If you are dishonest it won't work out.

766
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,440
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

767
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,040
Genuinely, please say that.

768
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,120
This is how I'm teaching you also how to raise your own Kundalini

769
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,560
"I forgive everyone."

770
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,240
Say it twice.

771
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,840
Absolutely genuinely you say it.

772
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,200
"I forgive everyone."

773
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,280
Now put this hand on your head.

774
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,120
Resting on your head in the center.

775
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,840
Try to press it and see if it is hot or cold.

776
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
Just see.

777
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,480
At this point

778
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,200
I have to request you

779
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,760
because I cannot get over your freedom.

780
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,160
I can not!

781
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,760
You have to ask for your realization.

782
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,080
I cannot just force you down into it,

783
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,480
so you have to say:

784
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,360
"Mother, please give me my realization."

785
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,360
Just say that at that point.

786
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Unless and until you ask for it I cannot do it.

787
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,520
I just can't do it.

788
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,360
I cannot force you into it.

789
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,279
Press the hand

790
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:16,739
hard,

791
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:19,007
hard you press it.

792
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,591
You can press it with fingers if you want.

793
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,200
Now raise your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

794
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,480
If not put your right hand

795
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,275
and with the left hand you can feel it.

796
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,809
See if there's a cool breeze coming out.

797
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,498
Normally people should feel it

798
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:59,166
but if you are complicated is rather difficult.

799
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,326
But normally you should.

800
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,800
Whole left is catching.

801
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,360
Put your another hand and see.

802
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,720
Will the Sahaja Yogi's see some of the people?

803
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,400
Because I'm in a hurry to go today, so just -

804
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,760
let's see if you can finish.

805
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
See this gentleman maybe. Yes, I don't know.

806
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,240
This one has asked right questions, no doubt.

807
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,800
