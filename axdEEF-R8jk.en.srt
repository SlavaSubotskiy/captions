00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:11,560
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,400
as well as your own Kundalini.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:28,440
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,600
about your own Kundalini,

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,800
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,600
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,920
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,560
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,960
but we do not know what purity means.

10
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,520
It means your chaste desire.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:12,640
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,000
That power is your own Mother and is settled

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,960
in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,640
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
She knows everything about you

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:43,320
and she is absolutely the knowledge - because she’s so pure.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:58,560
And, whatever chakras she touches, she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,600
beforehand, so she's quite prepared,

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,880
and she adjusts herself fully

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,920
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,920
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,960
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,080
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

24
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,560
and within you, in a human being, it is

25
00:02:50,600 --> 00:03:00,760
like many strands of energy. So it’s like a rope

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:10,880
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

27
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:21,200
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,440
raised to power hundred and eight.

29
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,920
But when your Kundalini rises,

30
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:34,120
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

31
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:43,240
Only one or two because it has to pass through the innermost nadi,

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,720
known as Brahma Nadi. It’s all a spiral throughout

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:04:04,400
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

34
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,680
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

35
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,760
The outermost nadi is the right side

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,000
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,240
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

38
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:43,000
By that, they relax the center. By the relaxation of the center,

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,120
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

40
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,680
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

41
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,480
then your eyes start relaxing,

42
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,400
your pupils start dilating

43
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,200
and your eyes can become like Mine,

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
very black, absolutely relaxed.

45
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,400
So, you can easily see in a person

46
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,000
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

48
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,080
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

49
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,280
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,320
love, compassion and attention;

51
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:53,560
all these three things are in that energy.

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,320
We know of many energies; like electrical energy,

53
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,680
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,680
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

55
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,480
they cannot work on their own.

56
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,960
They are to be handled by us.

57
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,880
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

58
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,320
and knows how to handle itself. It thinks.

59
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,640
If you see a seed being sprouted,

60
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,240
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

61
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,480
which knows how to go around the soft places

62
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,400
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

63
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:05,000
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

64
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,040
the way it moves.

65
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:15,520
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

66
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,440
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

67
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,040
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

68
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,760
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,320
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

70
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,200
When people get realization, they do not understand

71
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,400
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

72
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,640
Because they do not ask for these energies.

73
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,240
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

74
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,760
“I have to have more compassion.

75
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,640
My compassion is not all right.

76
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,240
My concern about others is not all right.

77
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,920
My generosity is not all right.

78
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,000
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love,”

79
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:33,440
then this energy starts moving,

80
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,520
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

81
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:57,200
But, if you do not want to be growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

82
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,880
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

83
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,280
she doesn't supply that energy

84
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,040
which is stored within you.

85
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,920
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

86
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,000
raised to power hundred and eight.

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,440
So what a storage you have within yourself.

88
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:27,280
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

89
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:35,240
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

90
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,720
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

91
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,920
or they would ask for money or something like that.

92
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,000
So these wants are not pure wants.

93
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,200
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,520
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

95
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,000
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,600
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you,

97
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:19,400
to make you grow by giving you a higher personality —

98
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:32,120
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

99
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

100
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
then we think he is a higher personality.

101
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Sometimes a person who is rich,

102
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,000
we think he is a higher personality.

103
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,680
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

104
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
is a higher personality.

105
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,320
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

106
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,440
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

107
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,520
we think he is a higher personality.

108
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,760
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

109
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,400
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

110
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

111
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,080
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

112
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:45,480
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

113
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:51,760
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

114
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,880
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

115
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

116
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:13,240
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

117
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,400
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

118
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,440
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

119
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,560
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

120
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,480
It has to have some protection,

121
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,480
some sort of a hardness outside.

122
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Now, that hardness is there, but the germ

123
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,760
has a capacity to break that hardness.

124
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,000
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
which even if you touch it might break. Can it break?

126
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,880
A germ – can it break the covering, the hard shell?

127
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,880
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

128
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,200
that such a hard shell,

129
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

130
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,960
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

131
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,760
So at that time, what happens

132
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:47,520
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

133
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:58,160
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

134
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:07,000
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

135
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,440
then the shell has to crack.

136
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,040
In the same way, this Kundalini,

137
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
which is a delicate thing —

138
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,880
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

139
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,440
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

140
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

141
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,240
protectiveness for that person.

142
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:41,840
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.” We always feel

143
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,800
such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality and that he should be protected.

144
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,720
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

145
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,320
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

146
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,800
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

147
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,240
That’s our concept, because we think

148
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,000
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

149
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:25,920
But just see that in a seed, it is that delicate germ grows

150
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,400
and breaks the shell. In the same way,

151
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:44,000
when we become really delicate like a germ

152
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:55,720
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

153
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,520
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

154
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,800
then these shells will break.

155
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,960
But it’s the other way round, normally.

156
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,600
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders. We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

157
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,720
Some of them came like tigers.

158
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,840
I didn’t know what to do to them.

159
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,200
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

160
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,520
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

161
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,840
So what we should ask for

162
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:56,200
is that beautiful, soft, soft, compassionate nature,

163
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
and then the Kundalini will supply

164
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:09,000
because she only has that. Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

165
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:16,680
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

166
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,520
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

167
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,320
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

168
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,320
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

169
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,120
So what she says, “You hate someone,

170
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,760
or you forgive…” She gives you the power to forgive.

171
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Like a sword has to fight a shield,

172
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,200
not a sword. So the violence, as they say,

173
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,080
can only be fought with non-violence.

174
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,520
In the same way, if we have to grow,

175
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,080
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

176
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:11,760
we have to see how softly we talk, how kindly we talk,

177
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:23,520
how considerate we are. Now this is externally,

178
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,760
but when you start doing that externally

179
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,240
the energy starts coming internally.

180
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,160
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

181
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,120
So that’s our thinking. No,

182
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
you’re thinking that time.

183
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,600
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

184
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,080
because you’re asking her help.

185
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,920
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

186
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,120
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

187
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,720
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

188
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,720
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

189
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,800
so how can she give you anger and temper.

190
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,280
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

191
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:28,320
How to get, I don’t know because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

192
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,880
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

193
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,920
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

194
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
So please remember,

195
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:51,160
those who try to bring in assertions

196
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
and conditionings and ego

197
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,440
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

198
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,880
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

199
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:28,040
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

200
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:39,720
holiness, chastity, self-respect, pure love,

201
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:48,600
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

202
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:56,080
to give you joy,

203
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,400
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

204
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,920
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

205
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,080
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

206
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:21,720
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

207
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,680
Supposing — I mean,

208
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,840
I don’t know about modern mothers,

209
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,720
but normally if I would go and say to my mother,

210
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,880
“Teach me how to be angry,”

211
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,840
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

212
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,840
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

213
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,000
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

214
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,120
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

215
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,080
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

216
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:17,160
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

217
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:25,080
make a very big problem for Kundalini

218
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,880
to enter into your attention.

219
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,600
Now, people always ask,

220
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,200
“Mother, how are we to grow?

221
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,440
What should we do?”

222
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,720
That’s why I say introspection.

223
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,800
There should be introspection.

224
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,880
“What do I want in this life?

225
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,080
I should be able to love many more people

226
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,320
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

227
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:11,600
All right. Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

228
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:24,600
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

229
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,400
How many things she has to give you

230
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:42,400
by which you become so powerful, so very powerful.

231
00:23:42,400 --> 00:24:15,720
No one can trouble you.

232
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:25,520
She gives you security. She gives you peace. She gives you wisdom.

233
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:38,680
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

234
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,680
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

235
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,560
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

236
00:24:49,600 --> 00:25:00,920
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

237
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,040
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

238
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,040
you jump on the left or the right side.

239
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

240
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,920
then you can become anything.

241
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

242
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,880
and all these things start coming in very easily

243
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:38,320
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

244
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,440
Because you move on that side —

245
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

246
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,960
You want diseases, have them.

247
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,080
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

248
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,280
Whatever you want, you can have it.

249
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,480
Also, that is available. Nobody can stop you.

250
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,120
You want to be sly,

251
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,320
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

252
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
This is also very common. I’ve heard

253
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

254
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,240
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

255
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,200
This is how we can never grow.

256
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,160
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

257
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,640
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

258
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:41,200
These things are not going to help us.

259
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:49,280
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage, to build them more churches

260
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,640
or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

261
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,600
had enough of problems.

262
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
So now we want to make for ourselves

263
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,480
abode of love and purity,

264
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,680
but those who are residents are not,

265
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,920
then how can you have love?

266
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,600
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things, there.

267
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,560
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

268
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:35,240
we have to understand that this light, this light spreads in your life,

269
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,720
outside your life and expresses itself

270
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,720
in a very, very beautiful manner.

271
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,520
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis

272
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,600
look very different from others.

273
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,120
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

274
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:01,000
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

275
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,600
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

276
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,320
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

277
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,520
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

278
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,720
They’re quite surprised how you

279
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,520
could be so sensible, so many of you.

280
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,320
So many people if they gather anywhere,

281
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,760
they can go amok in no time.

282
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,480
I mean, even a smaller group

283
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,600
can become mad.

284
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,440
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

285
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:44,720
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

286
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
by those simple village people.

287
00:28:48,720 --> 00:29:01,840
For that, you have to just desire. You just have to desire

288
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,720
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

289
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,520
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

290
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,200
You want money? All right, have it.

291
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,280
Move to the right side.

292
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,880
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

293
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,040
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

294
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,320
You can get many people

295
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,760
who will go and kill anybody they want to.

296
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,720
Then you want some publicity or something.

297
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
All right, get to the right side.

298
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:44,880
All these things can happen, whatever you want

299
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,840
according to the movement that you have.

300
00:29:49,880 --> 00:30:01,680
But for ascent, your desire should be pure desire

301
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:09,160
to get to that greater personality

302
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:21,800
of love and beautiful relationships.

303
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,320
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

304
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,800
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

305
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:44,840
Now, you have to find out what are we doing

306
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:54,400
as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

307
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,760
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

308
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,240
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

309
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,680
Also the Deities feel happy.

310
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,320
In that happy mood, you can achieve

311
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,120
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

312
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,160
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate, otherwise

313
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,720
all these strands will go back, slip down,

314
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,400
which have come out in the puja.

315
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,720
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

316
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:46,800
But you should understand that, ‘what do we get in this puja?’.

317
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,600
You come here – desire for that higher life.

318
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:02,160
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

319
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,120
If you want, you can do it.

320
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,000
It's again a question of your wanting.

321
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,840
So throughout it is ‘want’. What is your desire?

322
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:25,760
We have desire like ‘children’.

323
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,560
Some people want to have children.

324
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
After the children are born, then they say,

325
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,720
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

326
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,560
Then you want to have money

327
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,640
and most of those money people are now in jail.

328
00:32:50,640 --> 00:33:09,960
Then you want to have fame. The fame of the people never helps them,

329
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:20,040
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

330
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,120
If fame was such a good thing,

331
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,040
why should people be jealous?

332
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:39,840
So the power of Kundalini, which is your own mother,

333
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:49,080
which has to .. which has to rise, which has to come up,

334
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,600
which has to manifest itself,

335
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:00,640
because of your pure desire. So in your introspection,

336
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,640
in your pujas, in your meditation,

337
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,640
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

338
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,640
it is for pure desire of compassion

339
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,440
and love to be awakened within us –

340
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,120
you are already in the meditation, you're already growing,

341
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,120
the growth has started. And you'll grow so fast

342
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,600
that this shell, which is this human conditioning

343
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:40,280
and egos will just break open. And then this small little thing

344
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,480
which is only in the triangular bone — imagine in a .. there’s a very little

345
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,480
space in the triangular bone — that it comes out and manifests

346
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,040
and can save the whole world.

347
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:03,600
Just see the magnificence, the expansiveness,

348
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,720
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

349
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,920
and which came up in its full strength and has shown tremendous things.

350
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Such people are the really great people

351
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:30,320
and not the people who are trying to show off some sort of a brand

352
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,400
cloth they wear, try to show off, no. All these silly ideas and stupidities

353
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,680
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

354
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:57,400
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

355
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,480
your words become fragrant,

356
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:11,520
your glance becomes soothing,

357
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:21,760
your smile becomes satisfying. Everything,

358
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,120
all your being, is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

359
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,400
above all, joy.

360
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,240
And the joy you feel now - together

361
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,320
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

362
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,000
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

363
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,240
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing — very simple —

364
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,760
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

365
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,400
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

366
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:15,000
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

367
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,080
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

368
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:29,240
or something or we all become like Gibraltar, Rock of Gibraltar. No,

369
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,720
it doesn’t mean that. It means wherever you are, you are connected.

370
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,560
That is collectivity. A connected doesn’t mean

371
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,840
that you hate that person. No,

372
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,040
you’re connected means you love that person,

373
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,600
you’re concerned about that person.

374
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,400
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

375
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,640
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

376
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,800
then you are in collectivity. But people will live together

377
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,760
and everyday break each other’s heads.

378
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,880
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes

379
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:30,400
because they are nowhere near

380
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,040
the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

381
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,480
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

382
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,640
you may be anywhere.

383
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,000
You are just connected. And you are concerned.

384
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,080
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

385
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:57,320
into any part, any part of the world, you are connected

386
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,960
and you’re effective, you can manage.

387
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,040
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

388
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,920
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

389
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,720
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

390
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,080
where there’s not the other,

391
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,520
ananya, where there’s not the other, there’s no other personality.

392
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:36,840
These personalities are separated from you

393
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,920
because of left and right or could be both.

394
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,200
But you are yourself fully

395
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,320
when you’re absolutely detached

396
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,640
and your Kundalini is dancing.

397
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:04,200
You're alone and never alone.

398
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:15,960
This oneness with the whole gives you all the security that you want,

399
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,520
all the joy you want and that's why

400
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,200
Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

401
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:35,160
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

402
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,200
Kundalini won't rise.

403
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,600
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

404
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:50,640
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this and she just says things like that

405
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,080
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

406
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,640
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

407
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,960
We don’t want Hitlers.

408
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:16,200
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

409
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,120
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

410
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,000
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

411
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,520
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

412
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,960
You enjoy everything. All right, this is your hall,

413
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,840
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

414
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,640
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

415
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,400
other people’s money!

416
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:57,120
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent. It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

417
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,800
Maybe the one who will .. has got this, one must be worried about something. It might get spoiled

418
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,400
or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

419
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:14,240
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

420
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,080
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

421
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,960
because you are really so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

422
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Only person to person you enjoy.

423
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,160
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

424
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,280
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

425
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,520
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

426
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:47,200
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

427
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,160
is the source of knowledge.

428
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,920
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness,

429
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:07,240
everything. All that starts shining in through your faces.

430
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,480
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

431
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,600
There’s no need to put hands and see.

432
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,480
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

433
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:24,680
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

434
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,720
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

435
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,440
Now the reflection — supposing

436
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,680
you take an Indian mirror; you look in the mirror and you find

437
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:46,880
you look like nothing on earth, it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

438
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,280
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

439
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,800
then the reflection is correct, full –

440
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,720
but still not three dimensional.

441
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:07,000
But this is a four dimensional reflection — four dimensional,

442
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,520
what is called as turya state.

443
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:18,440
And that four dimensional personality

444
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:28,640
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

445
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,600
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

446
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:44,720
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

447
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,560
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

448
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,280
as well as please the Deities.

449
00:44:51,320 --> 00:45:00,440
Because this is an object, it is object, it is not to be changed –

450
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,760
but the reflection can change.

451
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:15,480
The movement of Kundalini also depends

452
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,000
on the temperament of the person,

453
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,280
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

454
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,280
First of all, there are people who doubt. They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

455
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,680
All right, even if they believe, they say, “Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

456
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:43,440
They don’t want to believe. So it’s dishonesty.

457
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:51,440
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

458
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,800
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

459
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:06,720
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

460
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,600
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

461
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,480
but actually by actualizing the experience.

462
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:35,800
Now, supposing you want to go to the garden, supposing.

463
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,120
Just you want to go to the garden

464
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,680
and suddenly you find in the garden.

465
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,480
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

466
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,040
“How am I in the garden?

467
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,320
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

468
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:58,280
All such things go on happening within you.

469
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,840
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

470
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,320
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

471
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,920
It just works it. And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

472
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,920
you develop that faith within yourself.

473
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:30,840
So that faith, if it is within you, nobody can challenge that faith,

474
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,440
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

475
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,640
experienced faith which is established within. You cannot be challenged.

476
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:49,600
If you have the faith, it will be done. That’s why

477
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,800
I always say don’t say even off-hand things

478
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,920
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

479
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,240
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

480
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,320
There is no need to say such things.

481
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,440
We have had so many experiences like this.

482
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,920
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis

483
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,000
not to say something off-hand because you must know you are connected now.

484
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

485
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,320
and you are now connected, now you are divine, you are realized souls,

486
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,320
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine. I can't talk like this to anyone.

487
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:44,600
Take any judge, for example, even from France, I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

488
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,640
It’s beyond their mind.

489
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:51,720
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

490
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,840
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

491
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:04,920
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

492
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,840
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

493
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,680
I absorb so much that I perspire.

494
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,120
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

495
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:23,080
and I am feeling hot. So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

496
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:29,920
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

497
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,400
But that becomes like a barometer.

498
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,720
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

499
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,320
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

500
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,560
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

501
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,920
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

502
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,280
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

503
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,040
but you just can’t stand it

504
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,400
because your Kundalini is a barometer

505
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,800
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

506
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,640
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem,

507
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,320
Agnya. Everybody, “Agnya is a problem.” Agnya is a problem.

508
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,880
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

509
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,240
No one says that  means that.

510
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,600
So you are the one who can know about yourself

511
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,280
that is Self Knowledge  and also you can know about others

512
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,000
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

513
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,840
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

514
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:50,200
So, for us it is important to know

515
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,040
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

516
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,800
that’s the pure mother of us.

517
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,600
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

518
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:08,480
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

519
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,800
different from others in a way that she ..

520
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:17,240
her awareness about us is different.

521
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,960
But, in her function, in her methods,

522
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,120
she’s just the same in everyone.

523
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:35,000
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

524
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,320
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

525
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,600
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

526
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:50,400
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

527
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,560
somebody’s in the throat.

528
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,400
It’s in the same place

529
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,800
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

530
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,520
It works the same way,

531
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,640
except that it has the knowledge.

532
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:12,040
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars, they work the same way  exactly the same.

533
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:18,000
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

534
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,600
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

535
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,880
But another Mercedes, which has to go

536
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,520
on a straight route, it will go on a straight route.

537
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,960
But the working is the same.

538
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,600
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

539
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,040
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

540
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,600
You cannot cheat her. She knows you very well

541
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,840
and that is the reason why today we are here

542
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,240
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

543
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,680
that “Oh, Mother, she has given — You have given us these great powers.

544
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,280
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

545
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:15,880
You have given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

546
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:27,720
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections very, very delicate connections

547
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,320
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

548
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,080
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

549
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:45,520
but very thin lines, sharp, thin.

550
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:53,400
This is how we are. Now we are all realized souls.

551
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:00,800
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow, we have to ask for,

552
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:07,680
desire for, something very beautiful.

553
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,640
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

554
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,800
How will you grow?

555
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,400
That's why I said we have to meditate

556
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,480
so we get into thoughtless awareness

557
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:29,920
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

558
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:40,080
I hope after today's program people will pay attention

559
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,560
to their own Kundalini and not to the defects of other people.

560
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,120
First you must grow

561
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,200
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

562
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,160
Then only you’ll be amazed.

563
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:10,960
You’ll grow into something really, a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

564
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:26,960
So may God bless you.

565
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,880
I didn’t want to go into the details of the mathematics

566
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,680
of three and a half and this and that and this — forget it.

567
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:42,760
There’s no need to deal with all those mathematical calculations and things.

568
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,520
There’s no need. I mean it’s the mathematics of love,

569
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,800
and what is the mathematics of love?

570
00:55:52,800 --> 00:56:01,840
But I am writing a book. If you want to know about it,

571
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,040
you can read it later on once you have become something great,

572
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,520
then, otherwise it will go into your head again.

573
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:19,040
Agnya is too much. What is making you so very Agnya?

574
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:50,760
Well, I didn’t say anything to hurt you, did I?

575
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:57,960
Better? I think we all should put our finger to our Agnya

576
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and move it a little. Here we become really thoughtlessly aware

577
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:36,320
and detached. Move it slowly. Ah, better, much relaxed
