1
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:30,340
This was least expected that we'll have a
Puja here or we'll have any program of this

2
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,340
kind.

3
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:43,919
But I think something was left out of the
whole program of such a fast one as you know

4
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:52,380
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

5
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,620
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

6
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:08,040
And I came here in London I learned that there
was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

7
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:19,740
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan
because it is the sister relationship

8
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
and brother relationship.

9
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:31,890
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna
was born the day his sister was born, and

10
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:44,300
this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed
I should say, into a lightning later on, but

11
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:54,819
She was the one who announced the existence
of Shri Krishna at that time - that He is

12
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,560
born and He is living, He is in the present.

13
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:05,889
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of
the lightning, and you have seen that whenever

14
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:12,560
I am going to any place, or I will be giving
a program or something, just before that,

15
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,700
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears
in the sky, you see, to show that announcement.

16
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:25,680
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

17
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:36,810
To make it more practical and understanding
is that we use electricity now for our televisions,

18
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,700
for our announcements, for telling people
about messages of something of great importance.

19
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,440
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

20
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:55,150
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement of the coming of Adi

21
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,150
Shakti.

22
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:04,230
But on the contrary, people start using it
as a pocket kept for our extra ego to be filled.

23
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:15,660
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty
when our sense of relationships are not all

24
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,660
right.

25
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:27,790
For example, we do not understand a sister
and a brother, the relationship, which is

26
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:39,250
very pure, and is above all kinds of contamination.

27
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:47,680
But as you know in the West, because maybe
of drinking and doing all kinds of things

28
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,370
which are against awareness, people have lost
the value system, and in that they have also

29
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,690
lost the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

30
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,500
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely
important - because of Her, announcement of

31
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,680
an incarnation takes place.

32
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:23,880
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

33
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,130
It works it out.

34
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:33,290
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides
in the left Vishuddhi, and I find that Vishnumaya

35
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,040
is the thing that suffers the most, especially
in the West, because it's a fashion to feel

36
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,230
guilty about everything.

37
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:53,620
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing

38
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,420
on this Earth, if you see from a practical
point of view might think it's a wrong thing

39
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:07,130
She has done, because to tell Kamsa that He
exists and He resides, is still existing,

40
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,850
is giving Him a danger and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

41
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,240
If I had not told, he would not have known."

42
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,740
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

43
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:31,910
So we have to see for ourselves that what
makes us guilty for small, small things is

44
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,430
actually is our own ego reacting against us
and wants us to reconcile with what mistakes

45
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,990
we have committed.

46
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:48,950
Like some people feel guilty because they
have said something they should not have said,

47
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:59,170
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

48
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:05,370
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

49
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,620
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

50
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,260
They feel guilty.

51
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,010
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

52
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,670
I mean such stupid things like that which
are regarded as norms in the society and people

53
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:29,680
start thinking that these norms are very,
very important - as if they are something

54
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,240
like a dharma and you must maintain those
norms.

55
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,520
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

56
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,560
You see some of them are so stupid and so
horrifying that I think, in England I feel,

57
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,870
there are some, which must be really completely
squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

58
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,440
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone, because God

59
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,080
knows what kinds of hands people are having,
what kinds of vibrations they have.

60
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:07,330
Now, when My husband has his reception sometimes
I have to shake hands with seven hundred people

61
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:15,430
coming in, and then seven hundred drunkards
going out.

62
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:22,670
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

63
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,770
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,
but for others to shake anybody's hand, is

64
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,991
better to do Namaste, though it might be some
a very simple Indian method, but I think is

65
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:40,170
the best way is to say, "Namaste", because
shaking hands can cause lots of problems to

66
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,450
human beings, and now with all these diseases
coming up and all that, I think one has to

67
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,280
be very careful about shaking hands.

68
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,050
Worse than that is in France I find is like
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

69
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,790
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

70
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:04,980
But they do kiss you all the time if you go
there, I had very bad shocks to begin with,

71
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,940
you see anybody would just get you, kiss you
here, kiss you there, you start looking at

72
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,150
the person.

73
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,540
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

74
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,980
But there is no need to do all, this is not
a very good way of wishing anyone, doesn't

75
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,939
show any respect, in both the cases.

76
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:27,760
When you shake hands also there's no respect
and even when you kiss somebody there is no

77
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
respect.

78
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:36,390
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect, and

79
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:41,080
this is one thing we have to do is to respect
each other.

80
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,270
But when we are not then we feel guilty, and
like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

81
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,820
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody
then we think we have done a big mistake.

82
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,579
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you
know.

83
00:14:54,579 --> 00:15:00,800
We get so much used to it, that even if you
see a statue you say "Thank you very much

84
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
for your darshan."

85
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,500
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit
too much.

86
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service
- or "sorry".

87
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,940
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

88
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,519
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

89
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,579
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

90
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,630
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

91
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,230
fault of the other person.

92
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,760
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

93
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,750
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

94
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,329
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

95
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,170
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

96
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,290
person.

97
00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:02,060
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

98
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
matter.

99
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,070
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

100
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,100
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

101
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,850
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

102
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,970
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

103
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,190
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

104
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,450
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

105
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,579
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

106
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:39,940
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

107
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,889
car to move and the car was moving.

108
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,880
I couldn't understand what was happening.

109
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,150
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

110
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,150
I said, "What's the matter?"

111
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,340
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

112
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,650
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

113
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,870
you should say "Thank you".

114
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:00,470
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

115
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,420
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

116
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,590
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

117
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:14,870
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

118
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,350
to people for what they have done.

119
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,060
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

120
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,800
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

121
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,620
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

122
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,151
Either you go to the left or to the right.

123
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:38,000
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

124
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,400
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

125
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,170
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

126
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,650
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

127
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:58,470
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

128
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,660
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

129
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,000
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

130
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
Christmas card is not important.

131
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,160
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

132
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,470
Is to wish this person.

133
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,209
Do you have that in your heart?

134
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:18,360
Did you feel that from your heart?

135
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,170
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

136
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,550
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

137
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,910
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

138
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,269
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

139
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,269
Should have done it.

140
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,889
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

141
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,710
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

142
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,230
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

143
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,510
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

144
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,390
have to worry about small, small things.

145
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,519
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

146
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,130
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

147
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,130
from their aggression.

148
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,860
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

149
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,940
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

150
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,570
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

151
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,570
I don't want."

152
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,190
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

153
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,510
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

154
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,640
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

155
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,780
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

156
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,990
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

157
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,300
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

158
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,459
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

159
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:01,459
But then he was told about it.

160
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:13,009
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

161
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:14,220
saint I have a duty to perform.

162
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,630
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

163
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:28,830
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

164
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:36,800
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

165
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:45,240
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

166
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,820
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

167
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,750
the left Vishuddhi.

168
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,160
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

169
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,861
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

170
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:10,949
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

171
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,570
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

172
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,550
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

173
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,060
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

174
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,730
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

175
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:34,330
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

176
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,769
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

177
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:45,840
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

178
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,519
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

179
00:21:48,519 --> 00:22:10,740
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

180
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:25,490
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

181
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:32,949
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

182
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:35,630
up, face it up and never do it again.

183
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:43,240
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

184
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,090
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

185
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,250
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

186
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,500
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

187
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,670
Another thing is the announcement.

188
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,069
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

189
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,880
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

190
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,670
have to go on telling about it.

191
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,670
It works!

192
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,670
It works very well.

193
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,530
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

194
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,290
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

195
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,630
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

196
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:25,769
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

197
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,769
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

198
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:32,810
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

199
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,530
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

200
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,240
He showed My photograph.

201
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Finished.

202
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,889
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

203
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:49,320
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

204
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,410
you singing, where are you fixed?"

205
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,690
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

206
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:01,140
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

207
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,489
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

208
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,210
The fellow was an Englishman.

209
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:11,359
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

210
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,550
Thik He."

211
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,810
So these things announcement helps a lot.

212
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:25,690
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

213
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,060
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

214
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,600
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

215
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,760
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

216
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
people will know.

217
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,150
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

218
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,970
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

219
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,970
If you like you can wear.

220
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,970
But there's a freedom to you.

221
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,180
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

222
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,020
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

223
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,830
wear these dresses and go about.

224
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,870
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

225
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,010
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

226
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,010
Why not?

227
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,989
They would like to see you in sarees.

228
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,300
If you want you can wear it.

229
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,460
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

230
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,729
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

231
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:23,400
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

232
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,340
and those jeans and things like that.

233
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,640
So it doesn't matter.

234
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,920
But then don't feel guilty with it.

235
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,520
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

236
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,420
Be a brave person.

237
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,300
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

238
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,510
Because you are brave you are doing it.

239
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,020
That's the culture that has to come.

240
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,760
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

241
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,640
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

242
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,739
Is it good?

243
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:58,580
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

244
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,980
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

245
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,260
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

246
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,040
All right, some people can, but not all.

247
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,849
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

248
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:17,120
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

249
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,510
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

250
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:28,220
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

251
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,100
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

252
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,790
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

253
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:42,040
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

254
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
beings.

255
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,979
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

256
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,770
into the state of Virata.

257
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,310
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

258
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,090
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

259
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,980
How can you be guilty?

260
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,790
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

261
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,340
He's the One.

262
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,790
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

263
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,840
You don't blame your hand for it.

264
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,640
What you blame is the body.

265
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

266
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,640
The body takes over.

267
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,050
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

268
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,580
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

269
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,880
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

270
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,070
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

271
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,979
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

272
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:41,290
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

273
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,830
It has no place.

274
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,370
It has no place.

275
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,800
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

276
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,120
What's the logic?

277
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,730
You cannot feel guilty.

278
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:00,870
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

279
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,690
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

280
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:08,640
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

281
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,380
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

282
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,450
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

283
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,450
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

284
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:22,960
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

285
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
No!

286
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,560
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

287
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:41,430
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

288
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,620
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

289
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,450
The collectivity part of it.

290
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,729
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

291
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:59,739
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

292
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:05,770
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

293
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,180
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

294
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:20,020
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

295
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,800
into thin air.

296
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,540
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

297
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,180
God knows where it has gone.

298
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:38,550
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

299
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,370
what it is.

300
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:48,350
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

301
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:55,650
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

302
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,350
Herself, shines and announces.

303
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,570
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

304
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,570
it?

305
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,570
We are saints.

306
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,650
Of course we are.

307
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,810
"Are you saints??"

308
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,970
"Yes, we are."

309
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,520
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

310
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,310
to feel shy about it.

311
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,460
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

312
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,810
But here we dare not have any procession.

313
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:30,170
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

314
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,170
a procession.

315
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,790
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

316
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:39,120
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

317
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,930
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

318
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,370
to announce, then you are.

319
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:52,060
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

320
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,400
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

321
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
about it.

322
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,310
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

323
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,920
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

324
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,260
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

325
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,840
guilty about everything.

326
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,080
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

327
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,440
That's the trouble.

328
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,010
Think of it positively.

329
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,700
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

330
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,160
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

331
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,960
have gone further."

332
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,700
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

333
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,080
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

334
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
destiny?

335
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
What have you to become?

336
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:58,320
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

337
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,859
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

338
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:08,671
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

339
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:15,810
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

340
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,969
can create so many things - it's true.

341
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:22,219
But, that is not your destiny.

342
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:26,349
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

343
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:30,900
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

344
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,560
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

345
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,830
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

346
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,339
only a few people were there putting the posters.

347
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:53,780
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

348
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,930
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

349
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,239
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

350
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:05,920
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

351
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,469
my, my, my, my that, my that."

352
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:11,260
So they live in an island.

353
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:16,630
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

354
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,800
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

355
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,020
Then they feel guilty.

356
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,820
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

357
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:37,200
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

358
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,910
of the whole of humanity.

359
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:46,589
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

360
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:54,290
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

361
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,290
way.

362
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,180
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

363
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:06,849
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

364
00:34:06,849 --> 00:34:12,969
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

365
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,670
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

366
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:21,450
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

367
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:26,570
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

368
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,020
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

369
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,460
They don't have to possess anyone.

370
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:36,610
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

371
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,390
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

372
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:47,210
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

373
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:54,989
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

374
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:55,989
parcel of the whole.

375
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:01,310
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

376
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:07,510
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

377
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,760
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

378
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,870
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

379
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,609
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

380
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:24,450
We are all one.

381
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,370
So what is there to say sorry?

382
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,110
There is no foreigner within us.

383
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:35,510
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

384
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,510
or anything.

385
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,930
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

386
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:48,520
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

387
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,380
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

388
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,800
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

389
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,219
They are part and parcel of My being.

390
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,960
So why should I send this to them?

391
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,410
But I can nourish them.

392
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,609
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

393
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:13,900
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

394
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,800
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

395
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,140
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

396
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
Think about it.

397
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,219
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

398
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,520
It is sometimes so.

399
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:39,300
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

400
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:45,000
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

401
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,910
they started the song.

402
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:52,560
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

403
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,930
that I like this song."

404
00:36:54,930 --> 00:37:00,760
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

405
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,810
also pleasing other people.

406
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,820
The example of that is like this.

407
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,730
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

408
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,906
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

409
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:17,750
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

410
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,030
mozzarella cheese.

411
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,510
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

412
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,839
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

413
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,720
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

414
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,510
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

415
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,510
"Eh, you have a choice?"

416
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,400
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

417
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,989
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

418
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,410
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

419
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:56,410
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

420
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,989
So this kind of understanding shows what?

421
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:05,440
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

422
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,290
You have not seen Me.

423
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:13,820
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

424
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,880
mozzarella, mozzarella.

425
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,760
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

426
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,910
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

427
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:33,250
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

428
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,250
no choice of anything.

429
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:40,190
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

430
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,109
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

431
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,469
I don't make fuss about things.

432
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:53,550
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

433
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,099
that they are not collective.

434
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,270
Collective is to understand Me fully.

435
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,859
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

436
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,130
They all know about it.

437
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,120
They know about the whole body.

438
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,489
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

439
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:15,640
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

440
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,359
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

441
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:25,020
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

442
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,989
thousand names of the Goddess.

443
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:33,180
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

444
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,250
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

445
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,520
She can finish people.

446
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,460
She's absolutely wrathful.

447
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,380
It's true, I accept, it is so.

448
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,280
But it is so, so it is so.

449
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,250
But you must understand My in full ways.

450
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,650
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

451
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:04,300
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

452
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,099
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

453
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:16,320
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

454
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,750
So the other side will definitely punish you.

455
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:27,760
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

456
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,839
understood properly.

457
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:33,749
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

458
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:37,740
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

459
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,669
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

460
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:47,199
Try to understand the essence of everything.

461
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,539
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

462
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:53,729
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

463
00:40:53,729 --> 00:41:03,859
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

464
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:06,169
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

465
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:08,710
We don't have to judge it mentally.

466
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,409
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

467
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,409
What is the need?

468
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:15,029
Ten minutes is sufficient.

469
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:19,729
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

470
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:25,669
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

471
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:31,370
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

472
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,539
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

473
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:41,360
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

474
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,610
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

475
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,060
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

476
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,689
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

477
00:41:52,689 --> 00:42:00,019
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

478
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:02,949
maximum love.

479
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:06,519
So many there are ways of handling things.

480
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:13,850
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

481
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:20,479
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

482
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:23,729
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

483
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:26,509
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

484
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:33,080
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

485
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:40,140
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

486
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,810
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

487
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,070
You are not facing it.

488
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,420
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

489
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,310
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

490
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,830
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

491
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:11,160
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

492
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,999
Because that is the essence.

493
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:19,080
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

494
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,130
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

495
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,600
mantras, they are not effective.

496
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:36,039
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

497
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,380
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

498
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,380
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

499
00:43:44,380 --> 00:44:14,299
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

500
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:21,549
It has the full effect.

501
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:32,100
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

502
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:39,110
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

503
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,110
bad.

504
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,019
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

505
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,039
You will do it.

506
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:46,570
You will hurt others.

507
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,570
You will torture others.

508
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,570
You will take advantage of them.

509
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,439
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

510
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,310
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

511
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,610
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

512
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:08,289
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

513
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:14,350
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

514
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:24,639
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

515
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,600
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

516
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,630
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

517
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:37,060
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

518
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,029
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

519
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:43,029
come and correct the sister.

520
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:49,009
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

521
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:51,610
relationship that you could think of.

522
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:57,469
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

523
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:02,889
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

524
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:08,799
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

525
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:12,239
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

526
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:18,229
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

527
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:24,539
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

528
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,179
it as a guilt.

529
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:29,220
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

530
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,049
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

531
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:40,120
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

532
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:46,600
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

533
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:57,400
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

534
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:04,519
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

535
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:09,929
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

536
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:18,729
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

537
00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:19,729
pleasure.

538
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:25,190
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

539
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,249
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

540
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:30,399
sister, doesn't matter.

541
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:36,969
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

542
00:47:36,969 --> 00:47:41,870
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

543
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:46,239
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

544
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,970
the sisters.

545
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:54,219
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

546
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:56,959
open - there should be no formality in it.

547
00:47:56,959 --> 00:48:00,549
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

548
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:06,459
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

549
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,459
But it can be the other way around.

550
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:13,009
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

551
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:16,779
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

552
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:17,919
So what?

553
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:20,820
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

554
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,879
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

555
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:25,879
Finished.

556
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:27,129
That's broken long time back.

557
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:30,689
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

558
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:35,340
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

559
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:40,330
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

560
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,749
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

561
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:56,450
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

562
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,830
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

563
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:03,659
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

564
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:07,179
That's why the discretion stands in between.

565
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:11,229
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

566
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:12,879
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

567
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:15,129
That discretion is in between.

568
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:22,249
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

569
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:28,479
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

570
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:33,129
Other than that it doesn't exist.

571
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:38,519
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

572
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:47,419
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

573
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:55,259
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

574
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,700
May God Bless you!

575
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,739
Now for a puja, we should have a very simple
puja.

576
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:05,560
Actually, I was saying there's no need to
give Me a saree because I am not anybody's

577
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:12,090
sister or a brother.

578
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,979
But Rakhi day, My brother is here.

579
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:20,029
It's nice that we can have it in a way My
physical brother is here.

580
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:27,049
It's very good we are having a rakhi program
today in his presence.

581
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:37,630
And, all of you should also understand that
it's a very subtle, pure, beautiful relationship

582
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:41,269
that exists between a brother and a sister.
