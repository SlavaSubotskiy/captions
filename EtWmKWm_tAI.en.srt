1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,280
I am sorry, I was dealing with some newspaper people, journalists,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,000
and they came very late,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,520
whatever it is.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,640
I found them to be very sensible

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,440
and very understanding.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,480
All of us have come to Aurangabad now,

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,160
and it seems this place is full of vibrations.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,920
Maybe here Shalivahana has ruled in this area,

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,360
but also there have been many saints

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,840
who were born on this side of Maharashtra,

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,480
and they perpetuated Dharma.

12
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,960
They always talked about self-realization.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Dharma gives you the balance.

14
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,480
It gives you the establishment

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,480
into proper behaviour,

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,920
proper understanding,

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
proper living,

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,240
but it doesn't give you the completion of your journey.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,280
It doesn't give you the satisfaction of reaching the destination.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,080
And your personality is still incomplete.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,560
So, one has to have the experience of the spirit.

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,240
As I was discussing with them today,

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I told them that those who do not have ...

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,680
the experience of the spirit ...

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,480
are not only incomplete, but are limited people.

26
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,800
So whatever they see, or whatever they know,

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,800
or whatever they criticize, is limited.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,080
As in English we say that "hate the sin and not the sinner".

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,080
Like many people who find something wrong with Christianity

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,320
start blaming Christ.

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,800
Christ did not created Christianity, first of all.

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
He did not create Christianity.

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,640
He did not create Christians.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,920
So there is no relationship between the two.

35
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,920
As you know, recently, they have found out

36
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,760
the books written by Thomas,

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,400
the disciple of Christ who was coming to India.

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,520
On his way he went to Egypt,

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,240
and there he wrote these treatise

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,600
and had put them in a big earthen vessel,

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,480
or perhaps it was a metallic thing,

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,240
and it was discovered fourty-two years back.

43
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
The people ...

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,240
whom he considers to be ...

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,720
authorized Christians, he calls them as Gnostic.

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,680
"Gne", "gne" in Sanskrit language means, "to know".

47
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,720
"Gne" means "to know".

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,200
And he has written that to know,

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,480
and to have the personal experience

50
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,480
is the only way to follow Christ.

51
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Clearly.

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
Not only that,

53
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,960
it's said that God Allmighty who is so kind,

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,560
why will He ask you to suffer?

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,840
So it challenges all the Christian principles of suffering.

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
In the same way, in all religions,

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,120
people have diverted from the right path,

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,800
and have come to the wrong path,

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and are indulging

60
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,480
into self-created religions,

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,800
which has no relationship with reality,

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
or with the incarnations,

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,520
those who started those religions

64
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,560
or who gave the ideas of the religion.

65
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,600
I hope you won't do that to Me,

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,360
because you are gnostic people.

67
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
You are the ones who know,

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,280
who have had self-realization.

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Without self-realization you cannot have a complete personality.

70
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,880
But as you see in Sahaja Yoga,

71
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
you don't have to go to Himalayas,

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,360
to give up your families;

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,800
you don't have to be away from the society

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,320
to get your realization.

75
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,920
You get your realization in the circumstances where you are born.

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,200
In the same society, in the same family-life.

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
But, you rise higher then them,

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,080
and try to pull them out of the mire in which they are existing.

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,520
This mire of ignorance has to be crossed,

80
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,760
and some of you have to do it.

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,120
And when you realize that,

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
then you should know that you all have to be very strong people.

83
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
You all have to be extremely strong.

84
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,640
If you are not strong enough,

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,800
how can you pull out the rest of them?

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,520
People who are mediocre

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,600
think that gradually they'll be allright,

88
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,760
and that they'll come up.

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,920
But I would suggest that you should make all-out-effort

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,160
to become strong Sahaja Yogis.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,320
To become strong Sahaja Yogis is not difficult.

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,640
Because you have all the powers within yourselves.

93
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,120
You have the Kundalini within yourselves.

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,840
And you know the way, how to become a realized soul.

95
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,160
The problems are of you being dragged into your ego

96
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,600
or into your conditioning.

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,240
Only two problems,

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,520
not more.

99
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,960
Like somebody asked, "How many turns there are in London?"

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,240
Only two, left or right.

101
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,960
So either you go to the left or to the right.

102
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,400
All the permutations and combinations of this left and right

103
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,440
starts working and then you get into trouble.

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,200
And then you get into problems.

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,040
But actually it is a very simple thing.

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,560
To get out of your ego should be the simplest

107
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,840
and that is where you try to understand yourself.

108
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,720
You see yourself. How you are reacting.

109
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,800
Where is your attention?

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
What are you doing?

111
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,520
What is your attitude towards Sahaja Yoga?

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,240
So many people think that "this is my house,

113
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,800
this is my family, this is my car,

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,160
this is my horse, this is my dog.

115
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know how far it goes - "my, my, my, my, my".

116
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,200
But nothing is yours.

117
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Yesterday, as Kabira has said it,

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,520
that "some cheat", that is the death, "will come

119
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,440
and take away everything that is not yours".

120
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,600
Then "my family" ...

121
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
then "my children" ...

122
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
All this is a nonsense,

123
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,920
and so, when you start getting attached to this word "my",

124
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,640
there where you fail completely

125
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,560
into your own understanding of your ego,

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,760
you're completely blinded by this ego.

127
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,520
First of all you should say that "nothing is mine".

128
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,400
Kabira has said that when the goat is living

129
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,800
she goes on saying "Mei, mei, mei ..."

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,200
means "I, I, I ..." in Hindi language.

131
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,680
Made a pun on the word "my".

132
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,920
And when she dies, and her intestines are taken out,

133
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:51,320
and are made into something that spins the ... cotton,

134
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,560
they go on the street, these people,

135
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,520
telling people that they are around,

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,920
they go on playing on that string

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,600
which is made from the intestines

138
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,000
of these goats,

139
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,760
it says, "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ..."

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,760
meaning "You are, you are, you are ..."

141
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,360
So one need not be like a goat,

142
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,280
that till you leave you go on saying "I, I, my, my ..."

143
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,560
When you die then your intestines have to be taken out

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,600
and put on that thing

145
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,200
just to make the sound "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ..."

146
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
So this sound of "I, I, I ..."

147
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,760
is made only by egoistical human beings,

148
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,320
but this ego is so much identified with you,

149
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,600
that you think that "I am this ego

150
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,160
and ego is me".

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,240
And in that ego you start doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

152
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
This ego takes you nowhere,

153
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,360
it takes you nowhere

154
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,680
but into a complete mire of ignorance about yourself.

155
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,600
Ultimately you become stupid,

156
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,040
others can tell you that you are stupid,

157
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,560
or you become idiotic,

158
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
or you get a bad name,

159
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,120
and everybody knows that you are doing all wrong things,

160
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,200
but nobody there tell you,

161
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,040
because you are to be reached with a barge pole.

162
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,840
Such a hot-tempered personality you become,

163
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,400
nobody dare come you and say that this is wrong,

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
it should not be done, it's stupid, idiotic,

165
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,240
and you, yourself, in that idiocity and stupidity

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,640
think no end of yourself.

167
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
This is the extreme of your ego.

168
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,840
But it's nice, we have people like Hitler to see.

169
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,960
So if you put Hitler as the ideal egoist

170
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,000
then you will not go on that road.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
Because it's a very slippery road

172
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,320
and maybe  one day you land up there.

173
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,320
The second side of ours,

174
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,040
which is a very, looks very morbid

175
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,120
and very mild, is the left side.

176
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
The movement on the left side is the emotional side.

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,400
You develope habits with the left side.

178
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,150
Now, some people have very dangerous habits,

179
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,200
some have simple habits.

180
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,680
Like I have a bad habit, or a good habit, you may say,

181
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,960
that i must put my right hand under my foot,

182
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,480
because it's all the time working, so I want to controll it.

183
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,200
So, I put it under my head like this, while sleeping

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,320
and sometimes under my foot,

185
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,960
just to make it little bit stop working, it works too hard.

186
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
Just to give it rest.

187
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,560
So under my pillow I put it and sleep.

188
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,200
But I discovered once, I hurt myself,

189
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,040
that I now cannot put it under my head.

190
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,120
I said, "It's a very funny habbit I have got."

191
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,080
But it's not such a dangerous one. It's quite good.

192
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,560
So I am continuing with it.

193
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,280
But I can get rid of it. It's very simple.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,320
But when I get rid of it

195
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,800
I think the people become overactive

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,680
so I put it again, under my pillow.

197
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,960
So as Sahaja Yogis all your habbits should be under your control.

198
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,480
Now the ...

199
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,720
habits we have formed through drugs,

200
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,880
from drinking, from anything, are very dangerous habbits.

201
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,240
Also, people have their attention being all the time around.

202
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,200
All the time is attention here, there and there,

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,560
attracting people, looking after them,

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
not looking after yourself.

205
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,840
This attention has to be brought under control. Is very important.

206
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,640
That's very simple, that whenever it happens,

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,760
you just put down your eyes.

208
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,760
Keep your eyes down.

209
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
That's one of the ways we ...

210
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,120
allow our attentiion to fritter away,

211
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,520
and also our growth becomes stunted.

212
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,880
This is a very very dangerous thing

213
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,120
which in the West specially we have developed.

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,360
Here, also, people must read every shop's name.

215
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
Indians have a bad habit,

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,800
because they have just now started reading,

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,920
so they want to read everything that they find, anything.

218
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,200
So on the road if there is a road of shops,

219
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,880
they read every name of every shop,

220
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,320
turn round again and see if they have missed anything.

221
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,960
It sounds stupid. But they all do it.

222
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,480
And all the time they are doing it.

223
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,720
So the attention, wherevever it goes,

224
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,960
has to be under our control.

225
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,600
We have to keep it, all the time under our control.

226
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,360
As Namadeva has said very clearly,

227
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,320
in Guru Grant Sahib has written,

228
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,560
that when a little child is flying the kite,

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,040
he's talking  to everyone,

230
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
he's playing in a way,

231
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,440
but his attention is on the kite.

232
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,840
And when a housewife is carring her duties,

233
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,200
putting her child on her waiste and working,

234
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,040
then she's doing all kinds of work,

235
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,080
but her attention is on the child.

236
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,720
The Ladies who are carrying

237
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,280
three-four earthen pots on their heads,

238
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,840
water filled up to the brim,

239
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
are walking, talking to each other,

240
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
having mirth and enjoyment,

241
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,440
but the attention is on the earthen pot, on their heads.

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,240
In the same way, whatever adventure you are into,

243
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,120
whatever you are doing, your attention should be on your spirit.

244
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,720
Then everything is under control,

245
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,200
and you can never get enveloped

246
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
into anything where attention should not be lost.

247
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,160
So, these two problems we have,

248
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,480
and those problems even after realization people have it.

249
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,680
So please try, when you are not meditating,

250
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,600
to keep your attention on your spirit.

251
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,000
Now, the person who is left-sided or right-sided,

252
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,880
he has developed a mechanism within himself to justify himself.

253
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,600
Through his intellect,

254
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,840
or maybe if they are ladies they have water power,

255
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,800
they'll start crying.

256
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,080
And you just don't know what to say to them.

257
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,760
If you tell them anything, first thing they'll do is to cry,

258
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,360
means sometimes I feel there are thousand arrows on My head

259
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,120
when they start crying.

260
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,240
It is impossible to say anything to them.

261
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,240
And if you talk to some men

262
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,680
the'lll give so many explanations

263
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,200
that you would feel like, just, going off to sleep.

264
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,440
It's so boring.

265
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,160
It''s easy to read some book like "War and Peace"

266
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,360
than to listen to the arguments of such people.

267
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,920
But they don't want to see

268
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,560
that this is all ego, which is talking,

269
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,800
It is not, they are talking,

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
it is not their spirit.

271
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,880
And if the spirit has to evolve

272
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,720
we have to be extremely wittnessing, in a full way,

273
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,200
very alert, extremely alert

274
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
and wittnessing ourselves, what are we doing.

275
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,920
Then only we reach the completion of our realization.

276
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,760
Unless and until you reach the completion of your realization,

277
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,480
you can never be masters of your attention,

278
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,000
and you can never be the enjoyer of your joy,

279
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,760
and you can never know the truth fully.

280
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,720
Achieve this Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa

281
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,800
you have to be extremely careful

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,560
about the instrument that God has given you,

283
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,480
this body, mind and emotions.

284
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,760
You have to keep them in check,

285
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,840
because wherever your habits are

286
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,560
they can never be joy giving, it's a joyless pursuit.

287
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,640
and wherever your ego is, it's a destructive effort.

288
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,160
So both things are detrimental to your growth,

289
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,920
apart from that, they are extremely dangerous thing for yogis.

290
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,560
So, as you are, in whatever conditions you are,

291
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,120
in whatever situations you are,

292
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,480
whatever may be the surroundings,

293
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:49,600
like a dirty mire full of creatures and filth,

294
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,640
you can become like lotuses.

295
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,920
When you become like lotuses

296
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,760
all that is filth, all that is horrible, can become fragrant.

297
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,440
And this is what we have to achieve.

298
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,280
When people will see the lotuses they'll come to you,

299
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,160
not to see the worms and to see the filth,

300
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,960
but to see the lotuses.

301
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,080
So please, this time, correct yourself,

302
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,560
you don't need anybody to correct you,

303
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,520
you just correct yourself,

304
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
watch out for yourself, and see for yourself.

305
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,480
If something doesn't work out just give up.

306
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,400
Don't go to extrems for anything.

307
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,000
Must learn to give up at a point

308
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,040
and be happy about it.

309
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,880
If you are contained within yourself,

310
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,440
if your hand is attached to your body,

311
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
then you reach up to a point and then leave it,

312
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
but if it is not attached, if it is disintegrated

313
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,720
then it goes all round and round and round

314
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,800
and comes back without anything.

315
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,320
That understanding has to be there in you people

316
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,320
because you're standing in the central part,

317
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,520
and you're attached to the central part, not only,

318
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,640
but you are identified with it.

319
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,760
So you cannot go too far to the left,

320
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,600
cannot go too far to the right,

321
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,880
if you do that you get lost.

322
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
Then you are no more a Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
and then no use having you here artificially or superficially

324
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,360
because it will be hypocrisy.

325
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:36,040
Whatever is needed to put you back into right frame you must accept.

326
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,080
And whatever is needed to understand Sahaja Yoga you have to do.

327
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,160
As I have said, please try to learn English language.

328
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,120
I cannot learn fourteen languages.

329
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,000
Very difficult.

330
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,920
It's surprising how I have learned this English language also.

331
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
So now to learn fourteen languages

332
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,240
I've to take fourteen Avataras again.

333
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,360
I don't ask you to learn Marathi.

334
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,280
Because that's the best language for Me to speak.

335
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,760
But at least try to learn Engllish.

336
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,400
and then we can see if you can learn Marathi or Hindi.

337
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,065
What is to say now?

338
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:16,186
that you are born in auspicious place.

339
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:17,986
this auspicious place

340
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,026
Aurangabad,

341
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,426
I feel that ,s very auspicious place.

342
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:25,266
Great Saints are born here.

343
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:29,065
Since thousand of years people worked

344
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,346
and gave you these Punyas.

345
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:35,866
Because of those Punyas you are here today

346
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,226
You behaved well,

347
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,065
respected Dharmas

348
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,226
but not yet reached the Completeness.

349
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,386
Therefore you took Self Realisation.

350
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,466
After getting Self Realisation

351
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:49,546
we should be able to see our defects.

352
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:51,786
Otherwise you have not got that light yet.

353
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,065
Now with the Foreigners

354
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,065
they have other defects.

355
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:58,386
and Indian people have another defects.

356
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:01,026
And now I see those defects so prominantly

357
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:03,946
that I feel sometimes better I tell them very clearly.

358
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:05,786
Actually

359
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:09,065
for Indians my house

360
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:12,986
my daughter, my grandson these things very much

361
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,065
and they are so much involved

362
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:18,546
in the family matters that

363
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:20,866
they can not come out of it.

364
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,306
I made 4-5 boys marriages and

365
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,146
sent them to Austria.

366
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:28,146
They had no jobs.

367
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:30,226
They got nice jobs there.

368
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:32,266
Immediately they made their own houses

369
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:36,065
or rather an Indian man can not live without home.

370
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:39,065
Even having all the facilities in the Ashram
they want their separate houses.

371
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,065
Their wives get bored

372
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,306
because to have separate house means to work on your own.

373
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:46,106
There are no servants, no nothing.

374
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,546
After having Delivery also they work on their own.

375
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:52,106
Though they are pregnant they have to work on their own.

376
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,026
Husbands will be enjoying outside.

377
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:55,786
They will have Cars,

378
00:23:56,106 --> 00:23:57,426
have Television

379
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,066
and then go everywhere.

380
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:00,506
After coming home

381
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:04,106
shout at wives,

382
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,065
‘You did not cook well,

383
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,786
did not do that’.

384
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,065
Wives got bored. What kind of husbands are this?

385
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,146
They can not work everything,

386
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:14,065
can not clean outside.

387
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:16,065
Only my house should be neat and clean

388
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:17,466
and go out for scrolling.

389
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,065
Everyone is the same here.

390
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:22,866
Here Indian men

391
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:24,065
can not work anything.

392
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,386
They do not use their hands for Work.

393
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:27,146
All are sophisticated.

394
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:29,746
We have appointed a Gardner.

395
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:31,026
Well, he is Gardner.

396
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:33,986
From Austria.

397
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:35,146
He is also

398
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,065
an agriculture adviser of U.N.

399
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:37,906
He came here.

400
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:39,866
He takes Spade and Scraper

401
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:41,065
in hands  and works so hard.

402
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,346
Indian men with hands on Waist

403
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:43,906
and wearing Gumboots.

404
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,186
I asked,“ why did you wear Gumboots?“

405
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,746
I have Problems with mud. Is it so?

406
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:51,146
Then you can go now and be royal.

407
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:54,906
These things are very much in us.

408
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:57,746
And speciality of Wives is that

409
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,506
they know well that our husbands

410
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:02,065
are in our control if the house

411
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:04,306
is clean and if they get delicious food.

412
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:05,866
So today this delicious Dish,

413
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:07,226
tommorrow another delicious Dish

414
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:08,986
for husband.

415
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:10,226
Then for the meal they

416
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:11,866
give you what you like.

417
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:13,065
So if you like bitter Gourds

418
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,106
then bring the bitter Gourd

419
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:15,466
at any cost from the Market.

420
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:17,065
Then cook them for husband.

421
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,946
All the time serve husband.

422
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,466
Whole time after husband.

423
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,306
First thing, due to this husbands get spoiled.

424
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:23,826
And.

425
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,186
Home is something special.

426
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:26,946
is our thinking

427
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:28,866
Our attention does not go beyond that.

428
00:25:30,306 --> 00:25:31,546
That is my, mine.

429
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,186
It becomes so

430
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:34,466
narrow minded that

431
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:35,946
we get destroyed in this.

432
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:40,306
This should go away from us

433
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:41,426
If you are Sahajyogis,

434
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:42,746
became Yogis

435
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,306
wherever they sit, it is your home,

436
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:49,065
wherever you go it is your home.

437
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:53,065
Do not ask,

438
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:54,186
the family is small.

439
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:56,026
How that smallness will become gross?

440
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:58,986
You are born in Yogabhumi of India

441
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,186
because of whatever Punyas

442
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:01,466
you earned

443
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,065
in past Births.

444
00:26:03,266 --> 00:26:05,306
But everything gets destroyed.

445
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:07,826
That greatness should come.

446
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:09,466
That greatness does not come and

447
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,065
Some people even say

448
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,386
it is very less in Men.

449
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:13,065
Now,

450
00:26:13,386 --> 00:26:15,146
Now all have written that

451
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:17,986
we like Indian women but not Indian Men.

452
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:19,746
Because all are lazy Lumps,

453
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,106
we can see it.

454
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:24,065
If there is dirt outside the house

455
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,826
they will still walk on it.

456
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:27,226
But women will keep the house clean.

457
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:29,826
But women are clever.

458
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:31,546
If the house is in order then

459
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,586
husband stays at home.

460
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:34,186
It is very difficult to keep him at home

461
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,746
because he always remains out.

462
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,946
Therefore we have the defect that

463
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:44,146
we do not have collectiveness in us.

464
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,306
How to become collective,

465
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,266
how to be nice with one another,

466
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:51,986
how to become compassionate

467
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,065
we do not think this.

468
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,386
Now with the great difficulties

469
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,266
we opened

470
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,546
an Ashram in Delhi.

471
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:58,106
Nobody wants to stay there.

472
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,065
Somehow we sent one couple from Mumbai.

473
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:02,065
Within 2 days returned back.

474
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:05,065
The feeling like

475
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,946
my home should be given up.

476
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,826
The day when you will say that

477
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,066
the whole world is my home

478
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,386
then can be said that

479
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:17,746
you have become great.

480
00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:19,226
The mind is so restricted.

481
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:22,065
How Sahajayogis will do progress.

482
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:23,906
Though they become Sahajayogis,

483
00:27:24,065 --> 00:27:25,065
even they meditate,

484
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:26,826
do Pujas, everything is OK.

485
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,065
It is past earnings.

486
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:31,026
But as it is.

487
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:33,826
No progress  beyond that.

488
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:36,065
I have found reason for that

489
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:38,386
is wasting time at home very much.

490
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,426
If you move only in Circle

491
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,506
how will you go further?

492
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:43,866
We can not get in Collectivity.

493
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,386
So much Selfcentreness.

494
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,386
Increase only Self Esteem.

495
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,346
My home,

496
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:51,746
my wife, my children

497
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:53,306
this and that.

498
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:55,226
Until you

499
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:56,065
do not come

500
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,746
out of this

501
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,065
it is only load of work.

502
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:00,906
It is just a Donkey-work.

503
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:04,065
If God is doing everything

504
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:05,306
then why do you become Donkey?

505
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:09,786
If you say you do everything

506
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:11,386
then you became donkey

507
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:13,306
Like Jesus

508
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:15,106
was sitting on a Donkey

509
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,386
and Donkey was carrying him.

510
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,386
That Donkey thought,

511
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,065
it became Jesus because

512
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:24,186
everyone was garlanding donkey.

513
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,226
Then Donkey started troubling Jesus.

514
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:29,426
So Jesus got down of donkey and went somewhere else.

515
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:32,106
From other side came the Washerman, the master of donkey.

516
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:34,546
He beated (slapped) donkey nicely.

517
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,866
Then it realised that it itself is donkey

518
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,186
and Jesus is Jesus.

519
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,346
Likewise Yogi is Yogi.

520
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,466
He is not donkey.

521
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:46,506
Unnecessary donkey-work.

522
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,226
To please wife,

523
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:51,546
please this person, please that person. There is no need.

524
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:54,546
In collectivity

525
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:55,906
One should get in collectivity.

526
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,386
To get in collectivity first of all

527
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:59,386
one should give up all these small small petty things.

528
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,906
Small person sees everything small.

529
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:04,906
Does not see anything gross.

530
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,026
Whatever is small,

531
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:07,986
which is false

532
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:09,026
is always easily accepted.

533
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:11,106
Therefore we have to make our mind great.

534
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:13,906
First of all my house these Words should be given up.

535
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:15,826
Mine, this word is false.

536
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,786
What is there in mine?

537
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:19,065
Like yesterday it was said

538
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,065
about Kabira

539
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,106
that one theif came

540
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,466
and robbed me.

541
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:24,746
Means who? Death.

542
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,226
The time when Death comes

543
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:27,386
everything remains behind.

544
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,826
Then my, mine everything is left behind.

545
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:31,266
But this Death has come in us

546
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,226
because we have become Sahajayogis now.

547
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,065
Formerly we were Eggs

548
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,866
and now

549
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:36,626
we have become Birds.

550
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:37,626
So everything from the past

551
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:38,706
has been left behind.

552
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:39,946
Now we

553
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,906
have to spread our Wings and take flights.

554
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:43,065
But we are

555
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:44,065
still entangled

556
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:45,146
in our Wings.

557
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:46,226
What to say now?

558
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:49,026
We are still stuck up in mud.

559
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,065
Which is not correct.

560
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,226
But after this everyone should

561
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:53,986
make his mind great.

562
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:55,106
Greatness should be adopted.

563
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,786
And this acceptance of greatness

564
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,786
should be enjoyed by everyone.

565
00:30:01,386 --> 00:30:02,506
So many people come here.

566
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:04,866
You do not speak with them, meet them.

567
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,946
Do not do any introduction with anyone. That is wrong.

568
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,186
When these people come many of you

569
00:30:09,746 --> 00:30:11,065
help them, serve them, agreed.

570
00:30:11,386 --> 00:30:12,786
But you should introduce yourself with them.

571
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:13,986
Make freindship with them

572
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:15,306
because they are your brothers

573
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:17,506
and you do not have any brothers

574
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:18,986
or any sisters.

575
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,065
These are your relatives.

576
00:30:20,306 --> 00:30:22,065
It is said that they are

577
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:23,466
your own near and dear ones.

578
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:25,386
Gyaneshwara has said clearly that

579
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,826
these are your own Kith and Kin.

580
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,346
these are your own Kith and Kin.

581
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:30,746
All others are

582
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:32,065
not your relatives.

583
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:33,186
There is no comparison between

584
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,226
you and them.

585
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,466
They say something and do something else.

586
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:38,666
I can say about my family that

587
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,866
some are in Sahajayoga, they are there.

588
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,506
Those who are not Yogis I do not know them.

589
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:43,786
They are Strangers.

590
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:45,786
So those people

591
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:46,906
who are not in Sahajayoga

592
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,506
are not relatives, accept this.

593
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:49,826
You

594
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:51,106
will be surprised.

595
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:52,466
Many things will be given up.

596
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:53,906
Now there is Maratha.

597
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,186
Then Maratha should

598
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,065
marry Maratha.

599
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:57,946
Then it is OK if he is beating his Wife.

600
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,346
It is OK even if he is not Sahajayogi.

601
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,065
It is OK however way he is treating her.

602
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,026
But Maratha should marry Maratha.

603
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:03,866
Why?

604
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:07,065
Tommorrow

605
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,306
if that girl is in trouble then

606
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:12,186
will your Maratha stand by her?

607
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:14,186
But Sahajayogi will stand by her.

608
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,346
Sahajayogi should marry Sahajayogi

609
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:21,066
and there if something goes wrong then

610
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:22,546
Mother we married in Sahajayoga

611
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:23,786
therfore we got in trouble.

612
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,026
This Cast system

613
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:29,306
or internal hatred

614
00:31:29,746 --> 00:31:31,426
about religion

615
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:32,306
or

616
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:33,506
about another Caste

617
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:34,986
or for another Country

618
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:36,066
that

619
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,065
will be disappeared only after marrying.

620
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:39,546
I do not see any other solution.

621
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:41,226
We can understand by seeing it.

622
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:43,186
Just few days ago I made

623
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:44,946
one Maratha girl’s marriage in Australia.

624
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:46,866
Her family members

625
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,065
made a big issue

626
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,546
and said that they will go to the Police. I said,“ Go.

627
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:53,065
Do as you like."

628
00:31:53,506 --> 00:31:54,866
She is an adult now.

629
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:55,986
She has all the rights.

630
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:56,986
They did (tried) a lot

631
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,986
but nothing could work out.

632
00:31:59,106 --> 00:32:01,866
Now that girl is very wise and got married

633
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:03,026
so nicely.

634
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:04,746
Her husband has a good Salary, etc.

635
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:05,986
They see this. Now

636
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:07,866
all of them want to go to Australia

637
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,065
with packings.

638
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,065
At the time of marriage they did stupidity.

639
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,986
Likewise we are Bramhins and marry only with Bramhins

640
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:19,306
and if tommorrow that Bramhin

641
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,906
threw out of the house, what will you do?

642
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:22,546
Then you will come to me.

643
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,266
Mataji, please do something

644
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:25,186
about our Son-in-law.

645
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:26,826
What should I do? You yourself found

646
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:28,026
such a Bramhin Son-in-law.

647
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:29,306
Then have it !

648
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:30,546
Why should I do for that?

649
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:33,266
Like this many

650
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,146
big big things we are

651
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:36,786
wasting blindly

652
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:38,146
and all these problems

653
00:32:39,065 --> 00:32:39,986
stood

654
00:32:40,146 --> 00:32:41,826
in front of us

655
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:44,466
because we did not raise our Aim. We are Yogis.

656
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:46,786
From inside we have become Ascetics

657
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,706
Though from outside we are free from worldly matters,

658
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,106
we have become Ascetics.

659
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:51,986
You should be proud that

660
00:32:52,065 --> 00:32:53,426
you have become Ascetics

661
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,746
and you should be happy about it.

662
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:57,226
Otherwise you will not progress,

663
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:59,065
will never progress.

664
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:01,346
Whatever you do you will not progress

665
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,065
until you make your mind great.

666
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:05,866
And we have many

667
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:08,146
misunderstandings in us those should

668
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,546
go away.

669
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:11,066
No one will be called

670
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:12,386
as real Yogi

671
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,866
unless all these false ideas go away.

672
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,065
So no one should keep

673
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,065
these all kinds of strange,

674
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,266
peculiar things in them.

675
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:22,426
You will be surprised about what I say.

676
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:23,546
Before this

677
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:24,426
in this

678
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,346
Maharashtra whichever many great Saints,

679
00:33:28,146 --> 00:33:29,546
Sages took birth.

680
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,946
Very great Saints.

681
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:34,146
Those Saints and Sages have told the same thing

682
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:36,186
that Cast system,

683
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,506
Religion-fanticism are very bad things.

684
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,026
Take any Stone and

685
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,666
Take any Stone and put Shendur or Kumkum on it.

686
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:45,026
It is said that

687
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,946
Nrusimha Saraswati (Freedom fighter) used to spit on it.

688
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,065
If he saw something like that used to spit on it.

689
00:33:52,426 --> 00:33:54,226
He raised his Weapons against them many a times.

690
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:55,746
But he was alone

691
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:57,786
and so people troubled him.

692
00:33:58,146 --> 00:33:59,065
Dnyaneswara also

693
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:00,746
suffered a lot. He was tortured

694
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,146
because he was Sanyasi’s son.

695
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:05,426
Though he was son of Sanyasi,

696
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,346
he was higher than

697
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,065
all the Bramhins.

698
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:12,065
In such a way

699
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:13,186
many things has happened

700
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:15,426
happened in our Country. So we should

701
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:16,546
learn from that history

702
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:18,266
and now we have become Yogis.

703
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:19,426
Therefore in such situations

704
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,266
we should behave ourselves so that

705
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:23,426
we are standing on our Basic Principles.

706
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,266
We have achieved everything.

707
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:27,866
So we do not belong to

708
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:28,986
those things. We are

709
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:30,026
only Yogis

710
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,346
and these things do not suit to Yogis.

711
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:35,386
In such way all the false ideas

712
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,065
or whatever way you had

713
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,065
them till today should be

714
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:42,065
given up and we should place

715
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,426
God in our hearts.

716
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,306
Without being obstinate

717
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:49,026
all those things should be given up.

718
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:51,065
Give up completely.

719
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,786
Chokha Mela was also a Saint.

720
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,065
And likewise

721
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,906
Ramdas Swami was also a Saint.

722
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,266
But followers of Ramdas Swami and followers of Chokha Mela

723
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,426
are fighting with each other.

724
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:02,746
It is a amazing.

725
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,186
If both are Saints

726
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:06,946
why should there be any fight between them.

727
00:35:07,466 --> 00:35:08,065
But it will be.

728
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:10,106
Because there is no vision

729
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:11,786
so these things happen.

730
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:13,346
Therefore

731
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:15,065
I want to tell you that

732
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:17,386
We have to come out of this Cast system and stupidity.

733
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:19,506
In Muslims,

734
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:20,346
in Christianity

735
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,906
it is same thing everywhere.

736
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,226
Though following these Religions

737
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:25,065
tell me one thing that

738
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,266
have you anywhere seen that man

739
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,306
can not do any Sin because of any Religion?

740
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:31,226
Ready for all kinds of Sins.

741
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:32,746
Though he is Muslim,

742
00:35:32,906 --> 00:35:35,065
Hindu or Christian.

743
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,066
I have not seen

744
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,506
any one who will not

745
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:39,946
commit any Sin.

746
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:41,786
But Yogis can not do any Sin.

747
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,986
If they do then Vibrations will go from hands.

748
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,506
Saints never did Sins.

749
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,226
No one had to tell them.

750
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:51,065
Automatically they became like that.

751
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,906
We should become like that

752
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:54,146
and achieve

753
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:57,146
that Stability forever.

754
00:35:57,627 --> 00:35:58,593
Sahajayoga is

755
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:00,441
a gate of Salvage (Moksha).

756
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:01,266
So you should

757
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,466
feel great that

758
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:04,065
you came to Sahajayoga.

759
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:05,946
You should respect yourself

760
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:07,506
and you should

761
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:08,346
grow

762
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:10,866
in that respect.

763
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:13,065
Actually we do not

764
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,226
have to sacrifice anything in Sahajayoga.

765
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,746
Yes, but if you give up your Wisdom

766
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:18,306
then we can not do anything.

767
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:21,026
But we do not need people who are great Sacrificers.

768
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,746
On the contrary there are only benefits.

769
00:36:24,546 --> 00:36:25,946
Everyone gets benefited

770
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,866
but there is also

771
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:30,546
an illusion. One should not get lost in that

772
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:33,065
There are many benefits. You will get Laxmi’s blessing,

773
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:34,866
shall get good health.

774
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,306
May get various benefits.

775
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:37,826
But it is an illusion.

776
00:36:38,106 --> 00:36:39,346
Beyond that is Spirit.

777
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:40,346
That we should achieve

778
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:42,226
and should be dwelling in it.

779
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,065
This I am telling you very clearly

780
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,986
and everyone should

781
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,866
give up all the things

782
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,065
of Religions and Religions fanaticism.

783
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:53,986
Likewise Atheists also

784
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:55,986
should open their Eyes and

785
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:57,306
see if there God exists or not.

786
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,146
They do not have any authority

787
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:01,226
to deny God, existence of God.

788
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:02,746
Who are they to say such things?

789
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:04,226
And if they say so

790
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:05,706
then they are wrong

791
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:06,866
because they have not yet

792
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:08,746
seen if God exists or not.

793
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,065
So there should be Purity.

794
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:14,066
One should make oneself absolute pure.

795
00:37:14,786 --> 00:37:16,065
And in that Purity

796
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:17,866
we should understand

797
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:20,346
know God.

798
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:21,341
Otherwise

799
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,065
it won’t be understood.

800
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:24,746
There won’t be oneness, unity

801
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,306
and any benefits ever.

802
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,451
Unnecessarily

803
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,442
we should not come here as we travel

804
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:30,946
to do pilgrimage to Pandhari.

805
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:32,739
I request you all that

806
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,557
you should achieve something.

807
00:37:34,582 --> 00:37:36,065
A very sincere request.

808
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,746
I see that here

809
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,832
in Maharashtra apart from lot of hardwork

810
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:41,942
why Sahajayoga has not deeply established.

811
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:45,114
Because only by doing my Puja nothing will happen.

812
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:46,721
What is the use?

813
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,426
You are anyway doing my puja in all Temples.

814
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:50,786
To do only Puja is useless here.

815
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,826
Today it should be decided and determined

816
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:54,065
that we are

817
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:55,361
doing Shri Mataji’s puja

818
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,226
keeping all this fanaticism away.

819
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:01,065
We are doing Shri Mataji’s puja keeping ourself clean.

820
00:38:01,386 --> 00:38:02,778
Then only there will be benefit.

821
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:04,746
Otherwise I am suffering from Puja.

822
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,706
This is

823
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:07,786
a big authority.

824
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,504
And though I have given you,

825
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,546
you should acquire

826
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:11,746
that deservence.

827
00:38:12,346 --> 00:38:13,946
And I bless you all !

828
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:15,026
Many blessings !

829
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,606
Please attention to yourself.

830
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:18,946
Know your importance !

831
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:20,450
Know your greatness !

832
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,106
Today which Task you have taken.

833
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,986
I have started this great Work

834
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,026
of Evolution of Universe.

835
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:26,066
You are standing there

836
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:28,715
and you should be prepared for that.

837
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,306
Everyone should be strong and ready.

838
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:32,426
Today is the first Day.

839
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,778
Therefore I say explicitly that

840
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,746
you are

841
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:38,361
organising whatever

842
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:39,226
to be done.

843
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:40,731
But I am not doing it

844
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:42,826
Mother is doing if you think this way

845
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:44,668
and then

846
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,161
then whatever we are doing

847
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,215
in that

848
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,506
let only Divine Work be manifested

849
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,554
if you desire this

850
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,081
then everything will be fine.

851
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:53,632
Everything will be fine.

852
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,386
Anyway, I bless you all.

853
00:38:55,411 --> 00:38:57,312
May God bless you all!
