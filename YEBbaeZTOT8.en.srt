00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,160
Shri Chakra and Shri Lalita Puja
Brahmapuri, India

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,680
17th December, 1990

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,680
The knowledge about Kundalini has been expressed
in many Sanskrit shastras since long, and

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:23,219
also in Ayurveda it is described; not only
that, but the books which are for curriculum

5
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:47,129
talk about Kundalini and the chakras, because
Ayurveda is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:01,659
Even in the Western medicine to begin with,
if you see the history, they too dealt with

7
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,120
three doshas, they dealt with three problems
that we have, as in Ayurveda: the right side

8
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,810
which has got pitta, means “bile”; left
side which has got kaph, means “phlegm”;

9
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:38,810
and the central path, the problems of vayu,
means the “gases.” Now luckily so many

10
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:48,650
Western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga,
and have tried to bring down all the permutations

11
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,400
and combinations to the simple reasoning of
left, right and center.

12
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,400
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely
basics. Even Ayurveda is one step away from

13
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,060
reality, or which you can say, the fundamentals.
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of

14
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,430
which a human being is built; and if this
knowledge was found out long time back in

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,430
India, should we not accept it? The reason
why people went into meditation in those days

16
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,620
and found out all these deeper things within
ourselves, because they didn’t have to fight

17
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:48,620
the nature. You have seen here nature, how
beautiful it is. You can spend all your life

18
00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:00,069
under a tree, while in the West even before
getting out of the house, you have to take

19
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,930
at least fifteen to twenty minutes to be prepared
to go out, it’s quite a struggle! So the

20
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,590
nature has been so kind, and that is the reason
people took to meditation and found out all

21
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,459
these deeper things within themself.

22
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,459
When they found it out, it was all written
in Sanskrit language. I have such a big thick

23
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,919
book on this, which has described all the
shakti peethas and all the Shri Chakras: Brahma

24
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Chakra, Lalita Chakras and all that. But this
was just written down, but hardly any person

25
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:00,999
got Realization. But in any other language
like Marathi or Hindi which was spoken and

26
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:07,999
written by common people, nothing was done.
Nobody knew about it. Only a few people who

27
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,159
read about it, specially the Shaivas, they
went into the research and they went into

28
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,630
the work. But very few people really got Realization,
very, very few. Then in the twelfth century

29
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,630
only the Nath Panthis who were experts of
Sanskrit, who were following it rigidly, that

30
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,130
one master should have one disciple, not more
than that: this was their tradition. But in

31
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,170
the twelfth century Gyanadeva, Gyaneshwara
who was another Nath Panthi – his guru was

32
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:54,170
his own brother – he asked the permission
from his brother that “Please allow me to

33
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,750
say all these things openly; at least to say,
in Marathi language. Because the common people

34
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:15,050
don’t know anything about this knowledge.”
So he allowed him, and he wrote the sixth

35
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:22,870
chapter of “Gyaneshwari,” in which he
described Kundalini. But it was in the twelfth

36
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,730
century.

37
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:34,730
After that many saints described, talked about
him. Where we went yesterday to Satara, you

38
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,880
know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa
lived, he said that Kundalini - they asked,

39
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,670
somebody asked, “How much time does it take
to raise the Kundalini?”

40
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,670
He said, “Tattchada,” means “that moment.”
But the person who wants to take it should

41
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,610
be deserving, and the one who wants to give
should be capable. It’s a big condition.

42
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,600
This is such a big “if,” capital “IF,”
I tell you. As a result very, very few people

43
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,780
got their Realization, and those who were
born as realized souls found it impossible

44
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,940
to talk to people.

45
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,700
Gyaneshwara, such a enlightened soul himself,
wrote one beautiful book called “Amritanubhava,”

46
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,700
which I will try to translate, which is very
joy-giving. To Me at least it’s very great

47
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,280
joy-giving. He went so deep into the understanding
of this joy. I wish English language would

48
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,430
provide Me that subtlety to translate that
book. That he wrote all these things when

49
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:50,550
he was only twenty-three years of age, and
at the age of twenty-three years he got so

50
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:57,550
fed up that he took a living samadhi. That
is, he entered into a cave and killed himself.

51
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,240
They all tortured him very much. Nowadays
this antahsadha stupid thing is not tortured

52
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,870
as much, but all these saints in this country
or any country have been very much tortured.

53
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,870
And there was no police protection, there
was no-one to publish about what these people

54
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,510
are up to.

55
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:30,510
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja
Yogis who are now occupying very big positions

56
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,680
in the government, and a day may come when
everything will explode. The biggest problem

57
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,730
of our country is something you cannot understand,
because you don’t have this problem there.

58
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:57,730
The amount of corruption we have from A to
Z, for everything, that you cannot understand.

59
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:05,780
I mean, I have never known any country where
they have to such an extent. Even, say, in

60
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,090
Philippines it was only one person who was
doing it. Here, every person has to get the

61
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,740
money, and has to pay the money to hire johnnies.
For this also, unless and until you get to

62
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,910
Sahaja Yoga, it won’t work out. And Sahaja
Yoga can only be worked out if people understand

63
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,600
that it is their heritage, and that they have
the capacity to understand Sahaja Yoga and

64
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,620
capability to spread it.

65
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,250
In North India it is much better, though the
vibrations in Maharashtra are much better,

66
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,250
it’s something funny. Vibrations in Maharashtra
is very good. The people in the North India

67
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,080
are very good Sahaja Yogis, and they are many,
many, many in number. We can’t say, even

68
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,930
in Bombay we get about twelve thousand people
for My programs. But still, the way it is

69
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,650
spreading in the North India is very surprising.
Also it is spreading - this is Satara, because

70
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:51,650
it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.
I think everywhere there is a flower there

71
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,520
has to be thorns, and this district has got
some really very bad culprits. Ahmadnagar

72
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,200
is much better. Aurangabad, we are doing much
better, it will work out in Aurangabad much

73
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,200
better. And then if you go to the other side,
Bela, from where I come, it’s going to work

74
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:23,370
out very fast, things are moving very fast
there. I was amazed. So many people have told

75
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,790
Me that in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis.
In Akola so many are there, and I was surprised:

76
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,680
I have never been. So that is how it is spreading
in Maharashtra. So your song of “Maharashtra

77
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,700
Desha” is working out, it’s not failing!

78
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:44,620
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.
Where we worked out yesterday, I gave them

79
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,920
left and right as to what they are. It has
helped them a lot, because those who came

80
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,920
to oppose sat down and got their Realization.
So they are misleading people to start some

81
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:07,210
sort of a new culture, like you started hippieism,
and they are collecting young people. The

82
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,450
young people are leaving their schools. Some
parents came and complained to Me about it.

83
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,150
They are not paying attention to their studies,
they are failing in their classes, and these

84
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,260
people are stupidly using them.

85
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,400
I asked some of the boys, “What is your
policy?”

86
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,330
He said, “We have no policy.”

87
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,089
“Then what is your aim?”

88
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:27,610
“We have no aim.”

89
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,820
“Then why are you doing this nonsense?”

90
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,240
They said, “Because whatever the elders
tell us, we do it.”

91
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,250
I said, “Have you no personality, nothing?”

92
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:41,779
This exactly happened when this hippie movement
started. Some so-called intellectuals started

93
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:47,520
this horrible hippie movement in the West,
and when they found they cannot do anything

94
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,460
about it, they found it’s going to fail:
so many children lost their education, so

95
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,560
many children I know became pregnant, girls,
and boys started squatting. All that took

96
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,930
them to the extreme that they became violent.
But unless and until there is a change within

97
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,860
yourself, how can you change anything outside?
You cannot. And the first seven people I fought

98
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,860
were all hippies, very difficult. They called
themselves hippies, but they used to hog like

99
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,399
a pig. They wanted all the comforts, everything
free, extremely dominating and quarrelsome

100
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,880
people. But the foundation was laid on them.
It’s very surprising! But I had to work

101
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,070
on them for at least four years, regularly.

102
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,110
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started, and today
you know how much it has spread, how far it

103
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,050
has gone. Only in Maharashtra this problem
is there of so-called “intellectuals,”

104
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:52,050
they’ve called themselves, but they have
no intelligence. I talked to one man; I got

105
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,839
fed up. He didn’t know anything about spirituality,
he didn’t know anything about medicine,

106
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,330
he didn’t know anything about science. I
said, “Now, what do you know?” It was

107
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:07,330
impossible. So such people who are jobless
because everybody can’t take them, they

108
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:16,770
have no work; they are starting all such things,
and we should not be upset with them. They

109
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,040
are trying to create problems, and they are
getting money from some sources. They are

110
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,190
afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,
perhaps, that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables

111
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:38,190
down, because we believe in honesty, and maybe
a day may come when these honest people might

112
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,240
harm them, perhaps, I do not know why. This
may be one of the reasons these people are

113
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,570
frightened of us.

114
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:05,570
But whatever it is, we have to understand
that for doing any great work, one has to

115
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,260
sacrifice. Of course you are not going to
be crucified like Christ, no. Nor you have

116
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,130
to sacrifice as My parents sacrificed for
the independence of this country. Nor you

117
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:23,130
are going to be tortured, but little inconveniences
you may have. But I must thank you very much

118
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,600
because of your coming here and singing Marathi
songs. They are quite impressed, and they

119
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,010
think it is only possible because you are
all Sahaja Yogis, otherwise you could not

120
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,330
have done it. So if there are any inconveniences,
think that it’s a joke, that’s all.

121
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,690
Today I was thinking we should do the puja
of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra, which we

122
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:58,690
have never done. This is the right place to
do these two chakras today. Lot has been written

123
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,690
about Shri Chakra and about Lalita Chakra.
But to understand fundamentally: the left

124
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:10,690
side, when it reaches up to Vishuddhi, then
it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra,

125
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,580
on the left side the Lalita Chakra, to manifest
itself. These two chakras are the ones who

126
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,149
manifest all that you see. But these chakras
are the ones who emit vibrations of different

127
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:28,149
kinds, and because of their angularities,
like if you have some sort of a cardboard

128
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,920
attached with small, small holes of different
colors and which rotates all the time, you

129
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:45,350
get different colors, also you can get different
permutations and combinations; in the same

130
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,350
way different permutations and combinations
are created, and that is how you get all the

131
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,850
advantages of Sahaja Yoga. So these two chakras
are very important.

132
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,850
I do not know if you know of any mantras about
Shri Chakra, but I’ll give you a book. Later

133
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,540
on I’ll translate it to you and you can
compose something for Shri Chakra; Shri Chakra

134
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,540
on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the left
side. So what we are really worshipping today

135
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,649
is Mahasaraswati Power and Mahakali Power,
both put together. So now we have started

136
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:30,290
combining things, not individual. Now these
two energies are very important. Without the

137
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,640
energy, without the power, nothing exists.
For example, if this light had no power to

138
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,740
give light or to burn, it is useless. In the
same way, without getting your Realization

139
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,740
you are useless, because your power is not
awakened; at least not complete. But these

140
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,480
two powers give us lots of benefits even without
Realization. Whatever you see in this world

141
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,310
created is done by these two chakras of the
Adi Shakti. But here the power doesn’t move,

142
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:08,310
it’s not moving. But in the human being
the power start moving, and when it starts

143
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:18,620
moving, then we can say it is creating another
world. But movement is not the only thing.

144
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:28,130
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives
you all kinds of things which you have as

145
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,770
human beings. But later on, this power itself
becomes enlightened within you, means the

146
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:43,740
left and right side both become enlightened.
This enlightenment, you get it when you get

147
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,100
your Self Realization, but not immediately,
not immediately, this one should understand.

148
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:57,100
For example, if you have pain or if your chakra
is catching, you have to use your hands. You

149
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,790
cannot say that “The energy is flowing within
me, so it’s all right, I can manage.”

150
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,790
It’s not like that. You have to use your
hands to impart that power to yourself or

151
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,660
to others. If you have pain in the stomach,
then you can say that “If there’s energy

152
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,490
in my stomach, why should I have pain in the
stomach?” But the play of these chakras

153
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,770
have to come, and that is why you have to
use your power of your hands. If you cannot

154
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,280
use your hands, then you cannot impart this
energy.

155
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,920
Many people have asked Me that “Mother,
when will it move horizontal?” It will move

156
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,040
horizontal, no doubt, it does. But even that
horizontal movement is to be guided by these

157
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,000
two very important chakras. So you must understand
the importance of these two chakras within

158
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,250
yourself. That’s why I’ve told many-a-times,
don’t move your head too many times. And

159
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:13,250
this way, many people talk, I mean it’s
style of talking, “no, this, that”; very

160
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,620
common, with French specially. That’s another
way you are not respecting your chakras. Shouldn’t

161
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,400
move your shoulders too much. Mostly they
talk like this: it’s anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

162
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,780
Should keep your shoulders straight. When
you are singing you can move your whole upper

163
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,870
part, is all right, but not your shoulders.
This is the thing one has to understand, that

164
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,660
these two centers are to be looked after.
You can move your neck, your body when you

165
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:57,660
are singing, is important, that helps; but
not your shoulders. Shoulders are to be kept

166
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:09,330
intact. But while saying just “yes,” you
need not go on “yes, yes, yes, yes.” It’s

167
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,440
very, very simple thing, but it can have a
very bad effect. And those who move their

168
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,570
shoulders too much do not feel vibrations
much, because the chakras are not all right.

169
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,630
It’s a very simple thing to be understood,
that they are the most important chakras we

170
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:25,630
have, and whatever is to be used out of this
Paramachaitanya, they have to be used by these

171
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:56,250
two centers. Even supposing your some chakra
is catching on your spinal cord, you have

172
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:07,070
to use your hands. Somebody can say, “ I
can just put my attention.” It doesn’t

173
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:18,740
work out that good, because yet your attention
has not that, reached that stage where these

174
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:39,870
chakras like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra
obey your attention; they do not. So you have

175
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:54,010
to work out with your hands. Be careful, don’t
move your shoulders too much. And if you see

176
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:29,309
now, Indians when they sing bhajans, they’ll
move the whole body, they’ll do like this;

177
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:17,679
but never their shoulders. The shoulders will
move in the same way as the neck is moving.

178
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:41,669
They might move their neck also, but they’ll
never move their shoulders like this, and

179
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,230
is regarded as inauspicious, according to
Indian standards.

180
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:59,230
Because of this culture, based on what the
saints have told and also about many seers

181
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:29,150
have told, it is more related to spiritual
life than to materialistic life. Now the materialistic

182
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:44,030
life, unless and until there is the foundation
of the spiritual life, takes you to a very

183
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:09,990
partial development, you can say. But to get
a full development, you must have your foundation

184
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:18,299
on spirituality. That’s why spirituality,
being the foundation, has to be deep, has

185
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:32,020
to be fully equipped, has to be absolutely
perfect. Then the whole building can be built.

186
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:45,980
But it’s gone wrong in the West, it doesn’t
matter; now you can build it up, and then

187
00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:01,510
you’ll be surprised how you’ll become
really solid people.

188
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,950
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.
I 
think I 

189
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:13,049
should sit down and write all about it, and
it will be nice, handy thing for you 

190
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:49,270
to read. But you must know that beyond thought
when you go, these chakras become extremely

191
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:02,270
efficient. Because the thought puts a pressure
on them, and because of the pressure the movement

192
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,750
of these chakras is very slow and ineffective.
But once you can get out of your thoughts

193
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:24,250
and go into thoughtless awareness, then these
chakras start working it out, and you start

194
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:51,029
moving much deeper into your own being.

195
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,230
