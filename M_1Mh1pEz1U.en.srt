1
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:09,617
Today we are going to celebrate the birth
of Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:30,010
He came on this earth in a very special
way, that He was born to a Virgin.

3
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:36,612
And we can understand

4
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:48,657
as you know as Shri Ganesha was also born
in the same way,

5
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:58,111
and as Jesus is an incarnation
of Shri Ganesha,

6
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:06,035
He had all His powers when He was born,

7
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:15,893
He did not have to bring any outward
weapons to show that what powers He had.

8
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:20,443
But He had all the powers with Him,

9
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:26,455
but still He tried to show tolerance and
understanding,

10
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:33,515
because at that time the people with whom
He had to deal

11
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:39,134
were absolutely ignorant of spirituality.

12
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,733
They were actually Jews

13
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:51,294
and they were instructed by Moses, Abraham,
all these people.

14
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:57,208
But they had lost their moorings, and they
didn’t know what to seek,

15
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:02,102
how to seek, and they were not seekers.

16
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:08,538
They are quite satisfied with all the Jewish
ritualism they had

17
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:14,812
as also in other religions we do the same.

18
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:21,588
There was no seeking at all for anything
great.

19
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:31,551
And so He had a very difficult life,
extremely difficult life.

20
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:37,160
When He was born there was a sign,

21
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:47,272
of a star which three men saw and they
followed it

22
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:56,570
and reached that place where they found
that He was born in a manger,

23
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:05,657
the very simple, simplest possible place
to be born.

24
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:10,668
Was born in all great difficulties

25
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:21,987
but it was shown clearly through a star
that He was something great.

26
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:28,351
The other day somebody was asking Me,
"How did You find Ganapatipule?"

27
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:35,048
Actually I didn’t know, and in Maharashtra
this is not a very well-known place.

28
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:38,632
They go to Ashtavinayakas but not to this
Mahaganapati.

29
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,611
They had no idea.

30
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,141
But I was coming back from Ratnagiri

31
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:53,224
and I saw really a very big star on top
of this temple.

32
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:56,627
But nobody could see it, that’s
the problem is.

33
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:59,535
At that time no sahaja yogis could see it.

34
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:07,015
So I told them, "Let us follow this star."
It was a very big, big one, unusually big,

35
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:14,985
not like a star, but quite a big, big star,
very unusual.

36
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:19,562
But they couldn’t see it. Other people who
were with Me

37
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:23,512
they said that, “We can’t see it.”

38
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:31,893
I said, “Doesn’t matter.” So I told them
to turn it,

39
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:39,567
turn it from this Hadkamba they call it,
and let us go on this another road.

40
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:47,481
And we just followed it. They, of course,
listened to Me, and they did not argue.

41
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,802
And we were travelling, travelling, we were
quite late,

42
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:55,871
but still I [said], “Doesn’t matter,
it’s alright, let’s go”.

43
00:04:56,072 --> 00:05:00,009
And by the time we reached Ganapatipule,

44
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,397
it was the dawn, beautiful dawn, I can’t
forget that.

45
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:12,881
And in that dawn we see such a beautiful
place here where we are now.

46
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:18,211
And I said, “This is the place where we
have to be,

47
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:23,907
where we have to get all the sahaja
yogis to.”

48
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:29,032
Of course, you know that Rabindranath
Tagore has already described

49
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:34,579
about this place that people will come here
from all over the world

50
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,470
and at the shore of Bharat this will be
done.

51
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:43,770
All these are predicted, have been done
already,

52
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,133
but how miraculously I discovered this
place is very surprising

53
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:54,988
as those three great men discovered Christ.

54
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:05,615
And the place was really blessed and was
very beautifully vibrated.

55
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:13,771
I stayed here for two days and I decided

56
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:19,167
that this is the place we have to take.

57
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:25,216
Ultimately we got this land and we got
all these things here.

58
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,475
 but people troubled us a lot.

59
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:35,016
Such negative people they troubled us.

60
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:41,872
Like Christ also was troubled and tortured, very much tortured by people.

61
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,398
So at a very young age His parents took him away

62
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:50,084
and they say that they were in Kashmir.

63
00:06:52,304 --> 00:07:00,764
And then He came back from Kashmir later on,

64
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:08,049
is described in one of the books I’ve read about Christ being in Kashmir,

65
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,416
 where He met Shalivahana,

66
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:15,212
I would say our forefather.

67
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:19,885
Is very well described, and in Sanskrit it is written.

68
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,705
I think the writer didn’t know what he was writing.

69
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:32,939
And the whole thing was the conversation between Christ and Shalivahan,

70
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,079
and Christ told that “The country from where I come is spiritually dead.

71
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:46,767
And the people are running after all filth and dirt.

72
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,040
This is My country and I want to live here”.

73
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,814
But Shalivahana told Him that, “You are such a great saint”.

74
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,876
He also told His name, as Issa.

75
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,282
“But You should go back to Your own country.

76
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,509
You go over back to Your own country and”

77
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:13,360
– the word he has used – “You teach them Nirmala Tattwam,

78
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,882
the principle of Nirmala”.

79
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,304
 Is clearly written in Sanskrit language.

80
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:25,781
But He went there, and the people were so negative, so negative,

81
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:30,609
that they crucified Him just after three years.

82
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:37,124
 This is the sad story of His incarnation.

83
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:42,751
But after that there were twelve disciples He had.

84
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:47,799
And out of these twelve disciples the weakest was Peter.

85
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:53,016
Very weak and he denied Christ thrice.

86
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,415
And Christ had told him that,

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,759
“ A satan will come and meet you”.

88
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,665
 It was Paul who met him.

89
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:11,657
And the whole thing changed into a satanic anti-Christ force, as Catholic church.

90
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,587
This Catholic church when I read about it I am shocked,

91
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:22,274
how can a religious movement be such a criminal thing.

92
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:27,327
It is absolutely criminal, it is anti-Christ.

93
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:33,249
It has been making all money, everything, deceiving people,

94
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:38,859
and brought what, nothing but their own kingdom.

95
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:43,913
They live like saints to show,

96
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:47,390
but all kinds of filth is going on in that Vatican,

97
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:50,202
I have read another book recently.

98
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:54,031
 But I can’t imagine how can they call them Christians

99
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:57,755
when Christ was innocence and purity.

100
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:04,373
Such a shame in the name of God to do all these things.

101
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:10,123
They also made artificial, we can say artificial

102
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:21,940
notes and distributed them through their own bank,

103
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:26,380
they have a banking system, they have all kinds of things,

104
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:30,802
I lived there, I know how terrible they are.

105
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:38,224
And this is what is the outcome of such
a great soul that sent by God.

106
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:44,949
They changed the Bible also – not only that, but they tortured the Gnostics,

107
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:51,160
the people, the early Christians who have had a religious experience.

108
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:59,863
All nonsense they are doing morning till evening and 
people are absolutely slavish about it.

109
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:04,865
They are talking of conversion:

110
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:09,185
what conversion has brought good to them?

111
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:14,575
In Italy there is mafia, there’s all kinds of nonsensical things

112
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:23,325
and the Catholics are all full of sins and they have to just go and confess.

113
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:32,146
When they are celebrating His millennium I was not at all very joyous about it,

114
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:38,986
because this is another way to make money, to make money out of this festival.

115
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:46,263
Actually Christ’s Birthday was not celebrated for 347 years,

116
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,794
and they thought it’s a good idea to celebrate His birthday so that we can make lots of money.

117
00:11:53,458 --> 00:12:02,978
First of all they are all allowed to drink and be merry, all these systems started of immorality there.

118
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,939
They also make a wine called Benedictine.

119
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,689
They are making all kinds of things which are filthy and bad,

120
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:15,603
and they have amassed so much of money with them

121
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:19,704
that no-one can challenge them and can ask them

122
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:23,235
to get out of the lives of people, but is the people

123
00:12:24,056 --> 00:12:27,832
who has seen it through and through and have given them up.

124
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,304
This is the beauty of Christ.

125
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:36,109
He has saved really these people, they were seekers of truth,

126
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:42,584
and they have been able to take to Sahaj,

127
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,475
to understand that there is truth in it, and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth. And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

128
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:50,178
and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth.

129
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:59,568
And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

130
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:02,996
They are quite frightened of Sahaja Yoga I must tell you,

131
00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:06,902
they know that we are standing on the truth.

132
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:11,535
They are very much frightened and they are trying their level best to harm us.

133
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,675
But so far they have not done anything, they couldn’t achieve anything

134
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:23,144
despite everything. At the end they had one argument through the newspaper about Sahaja Yoga

135
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:27,793
They said, ‘We don’t want to have one religion all over the world’.

136
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:31,122
I said, ‘Yes, because how will you fight then?

137
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,505
You must have many religions to fight’.

138
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:34,896
Then they stopped.

139
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:38,341
The newspaper they were arguing, they all stopped it.

140
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:45,060
All these nonsensical ideas came, and it became so much

141
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:50,411
of an extreme that people saw through it ‘This is wrong’,

142
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:54,636
and they really took to Sahaj.

143
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:02,527
If there is no truth, why are they converting people all over the world?

144
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:06,001
What have they achieved by conversion?

145
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:14,729
And that is why one has to understand that all religions are equally the same.

146
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:21,752
In its manifestation may be different, but in its essence

147
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:26,749
 they all say that you have to have your self-realization.

148
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,835
Whatever words, this way or that way,

149
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:38,467
it has said you must seek the truth, in the Bible if you read – even, you’ll be amazed, in Koran

150
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:44,140
though they have tried to camouflage lots of things, it has not been possible.

151
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:49,311
Now Muslims also have taken up another view,

152
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,757
worse than even Christians.

153
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,569
That they are saying that

154
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:04,694
Mohammed Sahib was the last incarnation.

155
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:11,999
If He was so, there were so many others afterwards they may not accept:

156
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,265
we had Guru Nanaka, we had Gyaneshwara,

157
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,350
we had Shri Shirdi Sainath.

158
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:23,257
How these prophets came on this earth?

159
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:25,679
How can you deny it?

160
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,733
If you say we don’t believe then you are stupid.

161
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:35,022
Because if He was the last,
how did these incarnations came here?

162
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:43,370
So many things Christ has said.
On the cross He said, “Behold the Mother”.

163
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:54,199
Behold, is a very good word, meaning that
look forward, see the Mother.

164
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:59,218
At the time of His death also He said this.

165
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:08,017
And all these people are just trying
to create violence, torture,

166
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:14,073
all kinds of things which cannot be Divine.

167
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:20,099
So one has to understand that you cannot
spread any religion

168
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:27,462
with violence, with force, you cannot.
Only with love and compassion.

169
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:32,729
You can spread Sahaja Yoga only through
love and compassion.

170
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,082
And that compassion is not a mental stuff

171
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:42,196
that we think we are better than others
so we should change them.

172
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:49,105
No. It is more love and compassion.

173
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:53,542
That you feel that we can really resurrect
people,

174
00:16:53,766 --> 00:17:00,668
not trying to change anything, but
to resurrect,

175
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:04,587
as they are, we will resurrect them.

176
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:10,236
This is our work: to resurrect people and
to give them the truth.

177
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:14,749
There are many, many people all over
the world, and you have seen now,

178
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:20,356
we are working in the 86 countries.
In a place like Benin

179
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:24,271
we have got seven hundred sahaja yogis,
seven thousand, sorry,

180
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:29,111
sahaja yogis, who were Muslims.

181
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:33,880
And I asked them, "How did you take
to Sahaj?"

182
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:36,605
He said, “Obvious.” I said, “Why?”

183
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,957
I said, “First of all, why did you become
Christians?”

184
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:46,740
He said, “No, we didn’t. We just became
Muslims.” “But why?”

185
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:54,511
“Because the French who were ruling there
were extremely immoral people,

186
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:59,359
very immoral. And we thought, what’s
the use of following their religion,

187
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,617
who drink all the time, and do all kinds
of filth,

188
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:10,776
so how can we be better off? So we took
to Islam.”

189
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:16,968
But they are now in Sahaja Yoga because
whatever it is

190
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:22,614
they have discrimination. They are seekers
and they have discrimination.

191
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:30,072
Imagine, they are all, we can call them
as people from the black, black people.

192
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:34,141
But they have such enlightened mind, I was
amazed.

193
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:38,854
They have made poems on Me, they have made
lots of things about Me,

194
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:42,047
and seven thousand of them have become,

195
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:47,782
and they said one day the whole country
will become, sahaja yogis.

196
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:57,975
In Turkey you know there is Islam,
so-called.

197
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:03,521
But there was their leader Atatürk Kemal
Pasha, who was an enlightened soul

198
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:09,011
and he talked to them that all this is
nonsense, this purdah system, this, that,

199
00:19:09,212 --> 00:19:11,571
oppression of women, all is nonsense.

200
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:17,166
And he really made them much free. They
are extremely creative people there,

201
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:23,647
and imagine, there are two thousand sahaja
yogis in Turkey.

202
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,182
When there was this earthquake, you’ll be
amazed to know

203
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:37,795
not one sahaja yogi was killed nor
anybody’s house was destroyed.

204
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,221
In our country also we have four, four
states

205
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,742
which were all converted into Catholicism.

206
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,267
Now I have talked to them, and they said,
“No, these people only told us

207
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:03,560
how to dress up well, go to church, sing
hymns and come back home.”

208
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:09,574
I was surprised: they are dressed better,
no doubt, than other people,

209
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:15,422
but how could they accept such a thing?
Because they are aboriginal,

210
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:24,002
they are people who are not yet open
to light of the modern times or anything.

211
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:27,824
And then after that,

212
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:38,732
after that, they were trying their hands
on Orissa.

213
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:48,131
In Orissa there were already 35 to 40
persons who were Catholics.

214
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:54,027
And I asked some sahaja yogis from
Australia

215
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:57,993
to go and do some work there of Sahaja
Yoga.

216
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:01,853
And they established nine centers there.

217
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,055
Nine centers of Sahaja Yoga were
established.

218
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:12,856
But the best part of it, when there was
a huge big destruction

219
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:18,059
through a hurricane that came,

220
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:28,014
all the sahaja yogis who have newly
accepted Sahaja Yoga, are all safe.

221
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,595
All their houses are safe.

222
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:39,131
So now what is going to come is the Last
Judgment.

223
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:45,082
In that all people who still are trying
fundamentalism,

224
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:49,325
who are fundamentalist, they’ll be
destroyed, I think so.

225
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:55,172
Because the way they are destroyed in all
these countries, I just don’t understand

226
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:59,579
what is happening and why these people are
getting destroyed,

227
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,458
their families destroyed, their houses
destroyed. Is the Kalki I think is acting,

228
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:11,830
and working it out in all these places
in such a severe manner.

229
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:19,689
Those people who do black magic and all
that, they were also destroyed.

230
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:27,323
Is very surprising that in Orissa not one
sahaja yogi was hurt.

231
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:35,978
It is such a big protection of the Divine
on sahaja yogis,

232
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,743
which was to come, was told long time back
it was going to come.

233
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:45,383
But people got lost in ritualism,
in the priesthood,

234
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:50,561
and its all kinds of talks.

235
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,852
By talking you cannot get a spiritual
experience,

236
00:22:56,053 --> 00:23:01,741
by reading you cannot get any spiritual
experience.

237
00:23:01,942 --> 00:23:07,857
Guru Nanaka has said it, Kabira has said it,
even Adi Shankaracharya has said

238
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:14,498
that this is Shabda Jalam, this is the web
of words. “Oh Mother, take me out of that”.

239
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:19,829
All these people who knew the truth have
said the same thing,

240
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,811
they have repeated the same thing, if you
read their lives you’ll be surprised.

241
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:32,159
Even the Sufis who were Muslims have
written the same thing all over.

242
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,202
It’s surprising, how can Sufis living
in Turkey

243
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:43,516
or living in, even they were in Pakistan –

244
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:47,564
now is Pakistan, that time it was India –

245
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:53,682
they all have written the same thing, some
great poets even from England

246
00:23:53,883 --> 00:24:02,093
have written the same thing, that truth
is truth, and truth is love.

247
00:24:02,294 --> 00:24:05,504
That’s what Christ wanted to establish,

248
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:10,540
but He was born in a very, very difficult
situation.

249
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:16,182
And the people who took over, as priests
and Church and all that,

250
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:23,426
made full advantage of that and have really
oppressed all the people.

251
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:29,728
There’s no oppression in Sahaja Yoga.
It’s your free will by which you come in.

252
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:36,798
And you have to find the truth, truth about
yourself, you should know yourself.

253
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,603
All the time Christ has said, “Know
Thyself.”

254
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:43,791
And they don’t try that at all anywhere,
Knowing Thyself,

255
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:47,467
because they don’t know themselves.

256
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:55,725
This situation we have in every religion.

257
00:24:55,926 --> 00:25:03,437
They all came to fight it, to tell us
what is the right path what to follow.

258
00:25:03,638 --> 00:25:06,799
What Christ did was a very remarkable
thing,

259
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,237
that He told the Jews that He is the Light,
He is the Path.

260
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:17,841
But He didn’t say He was the destination,
clearly,

261
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:22,529
because He knew that somebody has to come,

262
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,398
and He said the Holy Ghost will come,

263
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,878
and She’ll have three things as you know:

264
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:37,601
that She’ll be a Comforter, She’ll be
a Counselor, and She’ll be a Redeemer.

265
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:44,676
He didn’t use She or He, but in Hebrew
language it says “It”.

266
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:50,463
So people have misused Bible to such
an extent that in England

267
00:25:50,664 --> 00:25:56,046
a king wanted to divorce his wife so he
authorized the Bible.

268
00:25:56,247 --> 00:26:02,543
How can such an adharmic fellow authorize
such a holy book like Bible?

269
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:08,490
Because the power: with the power he want
to control,

270
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,973
want to control all that is reality.

271
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:16,763
This is a blind power.

272
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:22,619
But if you have a real power, then you know
what to respect, what not to respect.

273
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,959
Which way to go, which way not to go.

274
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:33,014
Because you have a sight, you know a very
bright understanding of the whole thing.

275
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:40,525
Which road you have to follow, where you
have to go, and which is the right thing.

276
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:46,239
Thank God through this Kali Yuga, because
of all kinds of horrible things,

277
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,807
as also among Hindus lots of funny, funny
rituals they have,

278
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:58,796
that people have seen through that this is
not the end of it.

279
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:02,539
You have to seek, you have to seek.

280
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:08,572
But the only thing which is very important
is that all of them have said

281
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:13,098
that you have to seek, you have to find out
your Self.

282
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:18,216
Which is very clearly written in some
of the Indian scriptures.

283
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:21,314
Some of them, I would say not all of them.

284
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:24,715
Some of them it is written that you must
seek your Self,

285
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:29,711
specially the saints who came on this earth
in India,

286
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:36,105
they have tried to say all the time that
you must seek,

287
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:39,773
you must find out the truth. Because they
knew the truth

288
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:42,972
and they wanted others to find the truth.

289
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:47,053
So in every religion there have been
enlightened people.

290
00:27:47,254 --> 00:27:54,019
Among Buddhists also there has been
a Viditama, Lao-Tse, and many others,

291
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,659
who have talked about seeking, seeking
the truth.

292
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:04,025
Christ has said it very clearly, very, very
clearly,

293
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:11,211
and at His birthday I feel very happy that
so many of you

294
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:15,187
have already found out the truth and that
you know

295
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:19,905
the path of love and compassion and
humility.

296
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:24,950
As it is we know where Christ resides
within us,

297
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:29,397
and how to respect Christ, and how
to worship it.

298
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:33,167
With this Agnya chakra you can make out
a person

299
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:42,014
whether he is a seeker or he is
a dominating arrogant Christian.

300
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,738
You cannot do that, if you are a Christian
you cannot be that.

301
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:49,590
If you are that, then you are not
a Christian.

302
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:52,443
Look at Christ, how humble He was.

303
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:57,402
He could have finished them off - He had
such powers - all of them;

304
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:05,302
but He got Himself crucified. The reason
was Agnya chakra was to be broken.

305
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:09,064
Was to be crossed. And so He accepted.

306
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:12,364
As I told you He had all the powers
of Shri Ganesha,

307
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:19,407
which are the most destructive powers.

308
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:24,214
All these powers come from Mother Earth,

309
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:28,758
and the Mother Earth can shake the whole
world.

310
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:33,271
But He was the One who came as Mahavishnu,

311
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:38,496
as described in the Devi Mahatmya. What
a person He was,

312
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:43,298
and what He did, all His work is
beautifully described in Mahavishnu.

313
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:50,945
Now I would tell you this, that if Christ
is born and He came on this earth,

314
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,773
it’s a very, very great occasion.

315
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:57,092
He gave His life for us, He did everything.

316
00:29:57,293 --> 00:30:01,873
And how are we following Him is
by forgiving.

317
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:07,816
You have to forgive others, you forgive
yourself and you forgive others.

318
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:12,114
Is very important if you want to open this
Agnya chakra,

319
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:16,826
where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.

320
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:20,338
If you cannot forgive others

321
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:25,515
and you cannot forgive yourself, then this
Agnya won’t open.

322
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:30,370
And the best part of it, all the Christian
nations I have seen,

323
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:36,434
where there are so-called Christians, they
all have a very bad Agnya.

324
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:42,273
If they are really following Christ, why
should there be a catch on the Agnya chakra?

325
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:49,792
And they are extremely dominating, arrogant
people.

326
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:55,980
They cannot be the disciples of Christ.
He was so humble,

327
00:30:56,181 --> 00:31:03,917
He was so much one with God Almighty, that
He accepted His crucifixion.

328
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:09,115
His birth itself is a very great miracle,

329
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:12,352
and His work is even greater.

330
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:18,765
We have to win over all the Christians and
tell them what is real Christianity,

331
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:22,606
what is reality, and what they should
take to,

332
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:27,958
and how they should justify their following
of Christ.

333
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,951
It is very big organizational thing, and
it’s a big, I mean, political thing,

334
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:41,209
I mean, all kinds of things are going on.
And all the bad things they have

335
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,733
from, say Hindu religion, they carry on.

336
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:49,706
So what is the use of conversion also?

337
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:57,221
So from His life we have to learn that
He took a birth

338
00:31:57,508 --> 00:32:04,761
in such a situation that nobody would have
dared to be born like that.

339
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:10,585
So much of darkness and ignorance, so much
of cruelty,

340
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:15,757
that He took His birth at that time is
extremely remarkable.

341
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:19,585
Such a brave, courageous personality.

342
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:23,289
Nowadays they make Christ look like
a TB patient, I mean,

343
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:30,294
just to beg, you know. Because they are
beggars. All the time they are begging.

344
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:37,008
And I was in Bombay this time, some little,
little girls and boys were singing songs

345
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:41,102
and they came up, and they said, “Give us
some money.”

346
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,859
I said, “What are you doing?”
“We are singing carols.”

347
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,036
“So you sing! Why do you need money for?”

348
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:52,191
“You know, we need money, we have no food
to eat.” Imagine.

349
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:57,770
Then why sing songs of Christ?

350
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:05,519
All kinds of begging is done. Christ, did
He beg for anything?

351
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,408
Did He want to create beggars on this
earth?

352
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:14,835
He died, lived with self-respect.

353
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:19,919
All His qualities are never studied and
people take

354
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:29,217
to something which is very mundane,
sometimes absolutely degrading, degrading.

355
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:35,085
He came to give us a very dharmic,

356
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:40,304
very… I shouldn’t say religious because
that's different meaning,

357
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:46,440
but I would say a very pious and beautiful
life.

358
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:50,642
He is the model, He is the model we have
to follow.

359
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:56,637
After Sahaja Yoga you realize what is
wrong, what is good.

360
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:04,630
Unless and until you become a sahaja yogi
is difficult to have this discrimination.

361
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:08,676
That’s how so many people are lost
in the name of Christ,

362
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:15,332
lost in the destructive forces of their
being.

363
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:24,175
As it is we call them all the six enemies
that we have.

364
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:29,141
So today, when we remember His life,

365
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:39,027
His birth, His work, His greatness,
His sacrifice,

366
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:44,097
we have to know that we have to follow
His life.

367
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:46,884
He is our model,

368
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:54,438
we have to bear lots of things, we have
to be tolerant, we cannot be aggressive,

369
00:34:55,633 --> 00:35:01,130
we cannot be threat to the freedom
of others.

370
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:04,141
I know there’s some are satanic people,

371
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:09,152
but we should not be a threat to them.
Our truth will fight.

372
00:35:09,353 --> 00:35:14,837
This is a very, very simple thing we have
to do.

373
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:19,757
In Sahaja Yoga see, I have seen people have
taken more

374
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:25,347
to a very moral life, and a moral behavior,

375
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:31,695
and a whole culture also. Sahaja Yoga
culture

376
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:39,378
is a very moral culture, very loving
culture, very compassionate culture.

377
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:46,402
And I am sure Christ within you will be
happy to see you in this manner.

378
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:49,594
May God bless you.
