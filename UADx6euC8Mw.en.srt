00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,440
Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 9 November 2003

2
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:37,983
Today is the great day of Diwali.

3
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:45,623
That means today is the great day .....(?)

4
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:49,543
lights of your heart together

5
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,623
to make a greater light

6
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:58,183
for the world to move in a proper direction.

7
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:06,183
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

8
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,983
are spreading also great joy.

9
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:18,023
But the problems are there, as they say,

10
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:24,343
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

11
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:27,423
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

12
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:30,623
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

13
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:43,303
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

14
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:48,703
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

15
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:57,303
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

16
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:00,823
but it is from within the source,

17
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:04,103
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

18
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:12,223
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

19
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:17,903
and our small petty things like jealousies

20
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:24,823
and competitions and all those things which spoil us

21
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:28,583
must be washed away.

22
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:34,463
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

23
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:45,103
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

24
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:52,143
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

25
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:57,383
and forgets these petty problems.

26
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:10,223
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

27
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:15,143
it's all luck that we got it,

28
00:04:15,383 --> 00:04:19,903
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

29
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,863
But it has just happened,

30
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:30,143
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

31
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:33,623
guided and looked after.

32
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,263
You are already blessed people,

33
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,663
there is no doubt about it.

34
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:45,143
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

35
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:49,103
It will all work out very well, you will see,

36
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:55,663
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

37
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:02,103
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

38
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:08,263
This is the promise of Diwali

39
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:15,463
to you all, that you will reach highest

40
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:20,343
and the noblest way of life.

41
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:28,583
Every word I say will be there

42
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:32,103
to prove what I say is there.

43
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,383
Whatever petty problems you have,

44
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,583
they'll all be washed off.

45
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:45,103
All these are the messages from the Divine,

46
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:49,503
you don't have to worry about petty things,

47
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:57,063
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

48
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,743
Your destiny will work it out.

49
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:07,383
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

50
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:14,703
I hope you believe in that promise

51
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:21,463
and are joyous in the highest way.

52
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:28,583
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

53
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:32,743
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

54
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,783
Thank you very much.
