Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA),
9 November 2003

2
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,904
Today is the great day of Diwali.

3
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:45,313
That means today is the great day .....(?)

4
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,373
lights of your heart together

5
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:53,210
to make a greater light

6
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:57,918
for the world to move in a proper direction.

7
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:06,293
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

8
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,001
are spreading also great joy.

9
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:17,918
But the problems are there, as they say,

10
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:23,293
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

11
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,918
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

12
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,001
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

13
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:42,918
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

14
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,918
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

15
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:56,918
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

16
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,418
but it is from within the source,

17
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,710
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

18
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:11,984
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

19
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:16,793
and our small petty things like jealousies

20
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:24,710
and competitions and all those things which spoilus

21
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,502
must be washed away.

22
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:33,502
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

23
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:44,126
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

24
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:51,918
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

25
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:56,710
and forgets these petty problems.

26
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:09,834
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

27
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,126
it's all luck that we got it,

28
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:18,001
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

29
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,627
But it has just happened,

30
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:30,627
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

31
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,918
guided and looked after.

32
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,210
You are already blessed people,

33
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,210
there is no doubt about it.

34
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:44,418
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

35
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,210
It will all work out very well, you will see,

36
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:55,418
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

37
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,710
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

38
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:08,043
This is the promise of Diwali

39
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:15,210
to you all, that you will reach highest

40
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:20,043
and the noblest way of life.

41
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:28,126
Every word I say will be there

42
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:32,043
to prove what I say is there.

43
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,834
Whatever petty problems you have,

44
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,043
they'll all be washed off.

45
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:44,335
All these are the messages from the Divine,

46
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:49,251
you don't have to worry about petty things,

47
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:56,834
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

48
00:05:57,126 --> 00:06:00,043
Your destiny will work it out.

49
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:07,126
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

50
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,460
I hope you believe in that promise

51
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:21,251
and are joyous in the highest way.

52
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:28,333
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

53
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:31,335
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

54
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,460
Thank you very much.
