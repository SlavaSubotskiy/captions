1
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,649
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

2
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:13,769
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

3
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:18,809
on this day of Sahasrara.

4
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,969
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

5
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:42,049
and new has started.

6
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:55,329
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

7
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:01,969
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

8
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,369
And gradually –

9
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:28,049
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

10
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:36,649
and gradually moving towards the completion,

11
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:45,649
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

12
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:04,569
It is a very natural process of growth

13
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,769
that you have gone through.

14
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,289
The first one was, we can say,

15
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,209
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

16
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:33,929
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

17
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:43,449
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

18
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:48,489
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

19
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,209
And you have the chakras same way built in,

20
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,369
in your Sahasrara.

21
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:15,729
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

22
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,929
the deities in your centers,

23
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:27,649
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

24
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,929
But now the time has come for us to spread it

25
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,129
on a horizontal level.

26
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,449
And to move it on the horizontal level,

27
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:59,689
we have to understand how to go about it.

28
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,529
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

29
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:23,249
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

30
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,329
of the chakras.

31
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:39,369
And when we start it from the back,

32
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,849
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

33
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:53,449
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

34
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:56,689
if you see it clearly.

35
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:23,129
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

36
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:27,729
because it's a concave replacement,

37
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:34,569
is important to understand that the center

38
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:44,649
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

39
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:08,089
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

40
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:28,249
I hope you understand what I mean.

41
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:37,649
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

42
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:43,689
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

43
00:10:53,969 --> 00:11:01,689
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

44
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:06,209
the Atma, coincide.

45
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:20,369
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

46
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,929
that is the Atma.

47
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:39,729
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

48
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:54,809
At this point of time it is very important to understand

49
00:11:54,969 --> 00:12:00,609
that we have to take a bigger step.

50
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:18,489
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

51
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:23,569
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

52
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:34,849
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

53
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:58,409
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

54
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,969
of all the incarnations is compassion,

55
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:10,049
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

56
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:28,049
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

57
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:33,089
we have to have compassion.

58
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:49,209
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

59
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:57,129
If God Almighty had no compassion,

60
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:06,249
He would not have created this great universe.

61
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:17,089
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

62
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:22,249
is the embodiment of His compassion.

63
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:35,889
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

64
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:42,889
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

65
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:59,129
And compassion is always completely covered

66
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,289
with forgiveness.

67
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:17,169
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

68
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:26,289
The Son of God is forgiveness,

69
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:29,649
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

70
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:40,569
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

71
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,049
the Mother who is the compassion

72
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,289
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

73
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:53,249
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

74
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:19,529
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

75
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:33,329
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

76
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:48,049
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

77
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,369
as you think it to be,

78
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,369
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

79
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:10,889
To develop this, you have to pay attention

80
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:17,289
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

81
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:35,489
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

82
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:42,809
then there you must establish the deity.

83
00:17:54,249 --> 00:18:01,049
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

84
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,689
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

85
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,689
in person with you.

86
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:30,049
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

87
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,089
had to imagine the deities,

88
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:48,129
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

89
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:58,809
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

90
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,809
that is how it is described –

91
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:12,249
so if you also see the person,

92
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:15,369
you may not be knowing fully that person

93
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,729
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

94
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,249
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

95
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:33,129
than your imagination.

96
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,929
That is why one has to surrender.

97
00:19:44,969 --> 00:19:50,729
With your limited imagination of brain,

98
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:56,369
one cannot see the deity.

99
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,729
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

100
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:10,809
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

101
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,209
So the devotion has to be there,

102
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:23,569
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

103
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:26,409
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

104
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,729
Heart should be clean.

105
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,049
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

106
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:53,849
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

107
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,849
of reality,

108
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,889
but reality is absolute.

109
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:10,729
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

110
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:17,849
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

111
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:30,849
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

112
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,689
not with very clean heart.

113
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,049
At that time we had lots of attachments,

114
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:54,129
we were identified with false things.

115
00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:02,529
And also we thought by getting realization

116
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:06,889
we’ll become very powerful people.

117
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:19,049
After realization also,

118
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:24,049
we started indulging into petty things.

119
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:36,289
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

120
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:39,609
mothers, sisters;

121
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:47,449
and the women thought of their husbands

122
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:52,649
and their brothers, children.

123
00:22:55,729 --> 00:23:00,649
They all asked for the blessings of all those

124
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,729
with whom they were entangled.

125
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:20,809
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

126
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:34,889
Now the job of a Avatara is such

127
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:41,009
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

128
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:52,409
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

129
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:58,649
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

130
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:16,729
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

131
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,609
“we want You to be with us,

132
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:22,609
individually with every one of us.”

133
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:35,289
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

134
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:40,409
and He was with every one of them.

135
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:51,129
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

136
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:56,289
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

137
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,569
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

138
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:04,369
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

139
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,609
whatever was possible.

140
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:16,649
Also the kshema that you asked for,

141
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:19,049
ashrams you asked for,

142
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:23,329
all the things that you needed,

143
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:31,049
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

144
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,489
So at the Krishna's level it was

145
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,729
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

146
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:50,569
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

147
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,289
because it was promised.

148
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:09,489
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

149
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,689
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

150
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:27,889
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

151
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:47,369
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

152
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:54,809
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

153
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:03,969
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

154
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:09,129
may dim out, or may be defective.

155
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:19,889
So, all the chakras that are within us

156
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,049
are to be looked after.

157
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:36,209
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

158
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:42,449
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

159
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,689
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

160
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:10,169
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

161
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:15,169
establish Him through your thought –

162
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:18,849
because now your thought is divine –

163
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,849
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

164
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:51,209
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

165
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,729
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

166
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,249
of these things to you, of …

167
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:02,929
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

168
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:14,289
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

169
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:18,289
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

170
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:22,449
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

171
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:30,409
And that's the country.

172
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,449
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

173
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,569
put your feelings towards Him,

174
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:59,209
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

175
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:06,649
And then to manifest compassion,

176
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,689
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

177
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:17,489
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

178
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,609
to all the people of the world."

179
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,009
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

180
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,689
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

181
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,769
you have no right to ask.

182
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:58,609
So to understand innocence

183
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,249
you should try to understand yourself,

184
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,329
how your mind is working.

185
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:18,009
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

186
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,169
should possess that person?

187
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:26,689
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

188
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:30,769
comes into your mind?

189
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:47,129
For an innocent person,

190
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:50,889
a beautiful person, or a woman,

191
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:55,249
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

192
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,249
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

193
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,289
there’s no thought.

194
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,889
So if there is no thought, there's no question

195
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:22,169
of having any expression of possessiveness

196
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:26,249
or any kind of a baser feeling.

197
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:45,289
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

198
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:49,009
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

199
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:54,249
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

200
00:32:54,409 --> 00:33:04,209
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

201
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:25,009
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

202
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,049
they feel I am innocent."

203
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:39,889
This is compassion,

204
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:45,369
the compassion to ask Him to give you

205
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:50,449
the power of compassion itself.

206
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:08,049
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

207
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:15,169
the light starts moving horizontally;

208
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:33,689
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

209
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:41,369
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

210
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,489
You don't become stupid or childish,

211
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:51,729
but you become child-like.

212
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:06,849
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

213
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:14,409
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

214
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:19,529
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

215
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,489
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

216
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:29,489
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

217
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,329
to impress others.

218
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:43,169
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

219
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:50,249
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

220
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,569
of deliberations.

221
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:10,049
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

222
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:22,969
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

223
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:28,849
expressing itself on horizontal level,

224
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:33,129
that you become discreet.

225
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:44,289
But that is a power, I'm again say,

226
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:48,449
the power of discretion you develop.

227
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:56,329
Now one must understand the difference between

228
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:01,329
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

229
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:08,409
So “the power” means it acts.

230
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:15,889
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

231
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,849
but if you are standing somewhere

232
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:23,969
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

233
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:36,729
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

234
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:40,369
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

235
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:45,529
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

236
00:37:56,729 --> 00:38:05,169
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

237
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:08,009
that acts by itself.

238
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:10,889
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

239
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:13,289
but you just become the vehicle,

240
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:18,249
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

241
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,609
Then you should believe,

242
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:38,729
now you are spreading horizontally.

243
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:52,129
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:56,969
you needed to see Me in person.

245
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,649
You needed to see Me in person.

246
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:11,369
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

247
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:15,649
You wanted the target in front of you.

248
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:28,889
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

249
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,929
whatever is to be achieved.

250
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:38,489
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

251
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,529
So now when you wanted that all the time,

252
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:48,249
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

253
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:53,249
when you had that in person before you.

254
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:07,609
Then in the second era, now,

255
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:13,169
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

256
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,729
you'll take it over from Me.

257
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:35,929
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

258
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:45,129
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

259
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:53,889
I am with you, you know that;

260
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:55,849
but need not be in this body,

261
00:40:56,009 --> 00:41:00,889
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

262
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:10,409
But once this desire starts working,

263
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:15,289
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

264
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:26,489
When the child is born to a mother,

265
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:31,049
automatically she gets milk.

266
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:43,049
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

267
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:48,329
In your divine desire also it is connected.

268
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:02,369
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

269
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:06,929
So you may find Me anywhere:

270
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,009
you are walking on the street,

271
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:13,249
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

272
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:29,849
So this is the second era we have started,

273
00:42:30,009 --> 00:42:32,289
and you should not be shocked

274
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,129
if you see Me sitting on your bed

275
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:41,049
and putting My hand on your head.

276
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:01,129
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

277
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:04,329
walking into your room,

278
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:12,089
or as Shri Rama.

279
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:16,049
That has to happen,

280
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:19,249
so you should be prepared.

281
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:29,809
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

282
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:33,049
but on a grosser level.

283
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,929
We have seen the light coming on My head,

284
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:45,849
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

285
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,889
But many things will happen,

286
00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:00,009
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

287
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:11,569
This has to happen, just to convince you

288
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:17,169
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

289
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:23,409
in the new area of Pragyalok.

290
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,009
Because this is a new state into which

291
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:40,129
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

292
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:55,049
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

293
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:11,849
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

294
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:18,609
The asking will disappear,

295
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:24,929
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

296
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:33,929
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

297
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:47,289
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

298
00:45:55,169 --> 00:46:05,209
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

299
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:15,369
Now the new work of compassion,

300
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:21,689
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

301
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,849
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

302
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:44,929
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

303
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:57,889
So you become the giver of compassion.

304
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:05,369
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

305
00:47:05,529 --> 00:47:10,689
I have requested you how to do tapah.

306
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:15,889
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

307
00:47:27,369 --> 00:47:34,569
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

308
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:40,409
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

309
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:00,089
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

310
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:02,689
that you have to do, because I am told

311
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:08,689
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

312
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:11,289
and you people suffered a little bit

313
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:15,449
on your way for the pilgrimage.

314
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:34,449
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

315
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:38,009
where the devils dare not go.

316
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,569
Fun: no word!

317
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:49,809
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

318
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:09,569
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

319
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:12,929
discomforts, then you should know

320
00:49:13,089 --> 00:49:15,209
you are on the right lights.

321
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:32,969
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

322
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:36,969
you should know you are progressing well.

323
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:46,329
As you become more peaceful and your temper

324
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:50,449
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

325
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:56,609
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

326
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:23,849
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

327
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:28,769
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

328
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:32,369
then know that you are progressing.

329
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:43,409
No amount ….

330
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:52,809
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

331
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:56,809
then know that you are progressing.

332
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:13,729
No amount of material well-being in others

333
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:18,769
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

334
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:22,889
then know that you are progressing well.

335
00:51:32,729 --> 00:51:37,529
No amount of

336
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,369
labor or

337
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:58,529
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

338
00:51:58,689 --> 00:52:03,089
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

339
00:52:03,249 --> 00:52:09,289
while you have got it without any effort.

340
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:13,329
So you are something special.

341
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:26,329
So this, once you understand that you are special,

342
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:30,489
you will become humble about it.

343
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:41,649
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

344
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:44,449
when you see you have achieved something,

345
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,689
that you have some powers,

346
00:52:46,849 --> 00:52:52,609
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

347
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:57,329
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

348
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:01,569
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

349
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:04,969
then you should believe

350
00:53:05,129 --> 00:53:10,009
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

351
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:35,649
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

352
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:45,289
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

353
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:02,609
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

354
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:05,729
you will be in meditation;

355
00:54:11,129 --> 00:54:16,689
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

356
00:54:25,049 --> 00:54:33,569
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

357
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:39,489
This is what you are in for;

358
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:45,689
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

359
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,889
on this great day of Sahasrara.

360
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:04,169
May God bless you all.
