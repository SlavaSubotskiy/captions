1
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:27,250
I am sorry, I was dealing with some newspaper people, journalists,

2
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,999
and they came very late,

3
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,500
whatever it is.

4
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,625
I found them to be very sensible

5
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,417
and very understanding.

6
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,458
All of us have come to Aurangabad now,

7
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:13,125
and it seems this place is full of vibrations.

8
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:19,917
Maybe here Shalivahana has ruled in this area,

9
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,333
but also there have been many saints

10
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:34,834
who were born on this side of Maharashtra,

11
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:40,458
and they perpetuated Dharma.

12
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,959
They always talked about self-realization.

13
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,834
Dharma gives you the balance.

14
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,458
It gives you the establishment

15
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:59,458
into proper behaviour,

16
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,917
proper understanding,

17
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,625
proper living,

18
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:16,208
but it doesn't give you the completion of your journey.

19
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:23,250
It doesn't give you the satisfaction of reaching the destination.

20
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,041
And your personality is still incomplete.

21
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:34,542
So, one has to have the experience of the spirit.

22
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,208
As I was discussing with them today,

23
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:45,834
I told them that those who do not have ...

24
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,667
the experience of the spirit ...

25
00:04:55,834 --> 00:05:00,458
are not only incomplete, but are limited people.

26
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,792
So whatever they see, or whatever they know,

27
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:09,792
or whatever they criticize, is limited.

28
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:16,041
As in English we say that "hate the sin and not the sinner".

29
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,041
Like many people who find something wrong with Christianity

30
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,291
start blaming Christ.

31
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,792
Christ did not created Christianity, first of all.

32
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,583
He did not create Christianity.

33
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,625
He did not create Christians.

34
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,917
So there is no relationship between the two.

35
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,917
As you know, recently, they have found out

36
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,750
the books written by Thomas,

37
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,375
the disciple of Christ who was coming to India.

38
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,500
On his way he went to Egypt,

39
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,208
and there he wrote these treatise

40
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:59,583
and had put them in a big earthen vessel,

41
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:04,458
or perhaps it was a metallic thing,

42
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:10,208
and it was discovered fourty-two years back.

43
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,333
The people ...

44
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,208
whom he considers to be ...

45
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:24,709
authorized Christians, he calls them as Gnostic.

46
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,667
"Gne", "gne" in Sanskrit language means, "to know".

47
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,709
"Gne" means "to know".

48
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:38,166
And he has written that to know,

49
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,458
and to have the personal experience

50
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,458
is the only way to follow Christ.

51
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,875
Clearly.

52
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,166
Not only that,

53
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,959
it's said that God Allmighty who is so kind,

54
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,542
why will He ask you to suffer?

55
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,834
So it challenges all the Christian principles of suffering.

56
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,333
In the same way, in all religions,

57
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,083
people have diverted from the right path,

58
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,792
and have come to the wrong path,

59
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,792
and are indulging

60
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,458
into self-created religions,

61
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,792
which has no relationship with reality,

62
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,667
or with the incarnations,

63
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,500
those who started those religions

64
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,542
or who gave the ideas of the religion.

65
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,583
I hope you won't do that to Me,

66
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,333
because you are gnostic people.

67
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,291
You are the ones who know,

68
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,250
who have had self-realization.

69
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:49,417
Without self-realization you cannot have a complete personality.

70
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,875
But as you see in Sahaja Yoga,

71
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,125
you don't have to go to Himalayas,

72
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,333
to give up your families;

73
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:01,792
you don't have to be away from the society

74
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,291
to get your realization.

75
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,917
You get your realization in the circumstances where you are born.

76
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:13,166
In the same society, in the same family-life.

77
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:17,125
But, you rise higher then them,

78
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:24,041
and try to pull them out of the mire in which they are existing.

79
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,500
This mire of ignorance has to be crossed,

80
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:32,750
and some of you have to do it.

81
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,083
And when you realize that,

82
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,709
then you should know that you all have to be very strong people.

83
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,208
You all have to be extremely strong.

84
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,625
If you are not strong enough,

85
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,792
how can you pull out the rest of them?

86
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,500
People who are mediocre

87
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,583
think that gradually they'll be allright,

88
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,750
and that they'll come up.

89
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,917
But I would suggest that you should make all-out-effort

90
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,125
to become strong Sahaja Yogis.

91
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,291
To become strong Sahaja Yogis is not difficult.

92
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,625
Because you have all the powers within yourselves.

93
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,083
You have the Kundalini within yourselves.

94
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,834
And you know the way, how to become a realized soul.

95
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,125
The problems are of you being dragged into your ego

96
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,583
or into your conditioning.

97
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,208
Only two problems,

98
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,500
not more.

99
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,959
Like somebody asked, "How many turns there are in London?"

100
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,208
Only two, left or right.

101
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,959
So either you go to the left or to the right.

102
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,375
All the permutations and combinations of this left and right

103
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,417
starts working and then you get into trouble.

104
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,166
And then you get into problems.

105
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:08,000
But actually it is a very simple thing.

106
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,542
To get out of your ego should be the simplest

107
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:20,834
and that is where you try to understand yourself.

108
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,709
You see yourself. How you are reacting.

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,792
Where is your attention?

110
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,542
What are you doing?

111
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,500
What is your attitude towards Sahaja Yoga?

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,208
So many people think that "this is my house,

113
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,792
this is my family, this is my car,

114
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,125
this is my horse, this is my dog.

115
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,999
I don't know how far it goes - "my, my, my, my, my".

116
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,166
But nothing is yours.

117
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,959
Yesterday, as Kabira has said it,

118
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,500
that "some cheat", that is the death, "will come

119
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,417
and take away everything that is not yours".

120
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,583
Then "my family" ...

121
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
then "my children" ...

122
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,041
All this is a nonsense,

123
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,917
and so, when you start getting attached to this word "my",

124
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,625
there where you fail completely

125
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,542
into your own understanding of your ego,

126
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:31,750
you're completely blinded by this ego.

127
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,500
First of all you should say that "nothing is mine".

128
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:44,375
Kabira has said that when the goat is living

129
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,792
she goes on saying "Mei, mei, mei ..."

130
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:51,166
means "I, I, I ..." in Hindi language.

131
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,667
Made a pun on the word "my".

132
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,917
And when she dies, and her intestines are taken out,

133
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:08,291
and are made into something that spins the ... cotton,

134
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,542
they go on the street, these people,

135
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
telling people that they are around,

136
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,917
they go on playing on that string

137
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,583
which is made from the intestines

138
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:24,999
of these goats,

139
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,750
it says, "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ..."

140
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,750
meaning "You are, you are, you are ..."

141
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,333
So one need not be like a goat,

142
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,250
that till you leave you go on saying "I, I, my, my ..."

143
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,542
When you die then your intestines have to be taken out

144
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:46,583
and put on that thing

145
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:51,166
just to make the sound "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi ..."

146
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,834
So this sound of "I, I, I ..."

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,750
is made only by egoistical human beings,

148
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:04,291
but this ego is so much identified with you,

149
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,583
that you think that "I am this ego

150
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,125
and ego is me".

151
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:19,208
And in that ego you start doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

152
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,917
This ego takes you nowhere,

153
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,333
it takes you nowhere

154
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:30,667
but into a complete mire of ignorance about yourself.

155
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,583
Ultimately you become stupid,

156
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,000
others can tell you that you are stupid,

157
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,542
or you become idiotic,

158
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,458
or you get a bad name,

159
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:46,083
and everybody knows that you are doing all wrong things,

160
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,166
but nobody there tell you,

161
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:52,000
because you are to be reached with a barge pole.

162
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,834
Such a hot-tempered personality you become,

163
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,375
nobody dare come you and say that this is wrong,

164
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,875
it should not be done, it's stupid, idiotic,

165
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:06,208
and you, yourself, in that idiocity and stupidity

166
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,625
think no end of yourself.

167
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,166
This is the extreme of your ego.

168
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:15,834
But it's nice, we have people like Hitler to see.

169
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,959
So if you put Hitler as the ideal egoist

170
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,999
then you will not go on that road.

171
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,875
Because it's a very slippery road

172
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,291
and maybe  one day you land up there.

173
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,291
The second side of ours,

174
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,000
which is a very, looks very morbid

175
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,083
and very mild, is the left side.

176
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,583
The movement on the left side is the emotional side.

177
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:49,375
You develope habits with the left side.

178
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:53,959
Now, some people have very dangerous habits,

179
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,166
some have simple habits.

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,667
Like I have a bad habit, or a good habit, you may say,

181
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,959
that i must put my right hand under my foot,

182
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,458
because it's all the time working, so I want to controll it.

183
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:11,166
So, I put it under my head like this, while sleeping

184
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,291
and sometimes under my foot,

185
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,959
just to make it little bit stop working, it works too hard.

186
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,667
Just to give it rest.

187
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,542
So under my pillow I put it and sleep.

188
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,166
But I discovered once, I hurt myself,

189
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,000
that I now cannot put it under my head.

190
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,083
I said, "It's a very funny habbit I have got."

191
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,041
But it's not such a dangerous one. It's quite good.

192
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,542
So I am continuing with it.

193
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,250
But I can get rid of it. It's very simple.

194
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,291
But when I get rid of it

195
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,792
I think the people become overactive

196
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,667
so I put it again, under my pillow.

197
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,959
So as Sahaja Yogis all your habbits should be under your control.

198
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,458
Now the ...

199
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,709
habits we have formed through drugs,

200
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,875
from drinking, from anything, are very dangerous habbits.

201
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:12,208
Also, people have their attention being all the time around.

202
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,166
All the time is attention here, there and there,

203
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,542
attracting people, looking after them,

204
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,125
not looking after yourself.

205
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,834
This attention has to be brought under control. Is very important.

206
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,625
That's very simple, that whenever it happens,

207
00:16:30,834 --> 00:16:33,750
you just put down your eyes.

208
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,750
Keep your eyes down.

209
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,417
That's one of the ways we ...

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,083
allow our attentiion to fritter away,

211
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:47,500
and also our growth becomes stunted.

212
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,875
This is a very very dangerous thing

213
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,083
which in the West specially we have developed.

214
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,333
Here, also, people must read every shop's name.

215
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,792
Indians have a bad habit,

216
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:03,792
because they have just now started reading,

217
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,917
so they want to read everything that they find, anything.

218
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:11,166
So on the road if there is a road of shops,

219
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,875
they read every name of every shop,

220
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:18,291
turn round again and see if they have missed anything.

221
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,959
It sounds stupid. But they all do it.

222
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,458
And all the time they are doing it.

223
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,709
So the attention, wherevever it goes,

224
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,959
has to be under our control.

225
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:36,583
We have to keep it, all the time under our control.

226
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,333
As Namadeva has said very clearly,

227
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,291
in Guru Grant Sahib has written,

228
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,542
that when a little child is flying the kite,

229
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,000
he's talking  to everyone,

230
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,125
he's playing in a way,

231
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,417
but his attention is on the kite.

232
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:04,834
And when a housewife is carring her duties,

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,166
putting her child on her waiste and working,

234
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,000
then she's doing all kinds of work,

235
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,041
but her attention is on the child.

236
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,709
The Ladies who are carrying

237
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:25,250
three-four earthen pots on their heads,

238
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:29,834
water filled up to the brim,

239
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,792
are walking, talking to each other,

240
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,208
having mirth and enjoyment,

241
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:41,417
but the attention is on the earthen pot, on their heads.

242
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:45,208
In the same way, whatever adventure you are into,

243
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:50,083
whatever you are doing, your attention should be on your spirit.

244
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,709
Then everything is under control,

245
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,166
and you can never get enveloped

246
00:18:55,458 --> 00:19:00,417
into anything where attention should not be lost.

247
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
So, these two problems we have,

248
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:08,458
and those problems even after realization people have it.

249
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:12,667
So please try, when you are not meditating,

250
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:16,583
to keep your attention on your spirit.

251
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:22,999
Now, the person who is left-sided or right-sided,

252
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:28,875
he has developed a mechanism within himself to justify himself.

253
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,583
Through his intellect,

254
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,834
or maybe if they are ladies they have water power,

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,792
they'll start crying.

256
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
And you just don't know what to say to them.

257
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,750
If you tell them anything, first thing they'll do is to cry,

258
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:44,333
means sometimes I feel there are thousand arrows on My head

259
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,083
when they start crying.

260
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,208
It is impossible to say anything to them.

261
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,208
And if you talk to some men

262
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:51,667
the'lll give so many explanations

263
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:56,166
that you would feel like, just, going off to sleep.

264
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,417
It's so boring.

265
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,125
It''s easy to read some book like "War and Peace"

266
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,333
than to listen to the arguments of such people.

267
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,917
But they don't want to see

268
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,542
that this is all ego, which is talking,

269
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,792
It is not, they are talking,

270
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,583
it is not their spirit.

271
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,875
And if the spirit has to evolve

272
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:27,709
we have to be extremely wittnessing, in a full way,

273
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,166
very alert, extremely alert

274
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,792
and wittnessing ourselves, what are we doing.

275
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:38,917
Then only we reach the completion of our realization.

276
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,750
Unless and until you reach the completion of your realization,

277
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,458
you can never be masters of your attention,

278
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,999
and you can never be the enjoyer of your joy,

279
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,750
and you can never know the truth fully.

280
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:06,709
Achieve this Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa

281
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:09,792
you have to be extremely careful

282
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:13,542
about the instrument that God has given you,

283
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:19,458
this body, mind and emotions.

284
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,750
You have to keep them in check,

285
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,834
because wherever your habits are

286
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,542
they can never be joy giving, it's a joyless pursuit.

287
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:35,625
and wherever your ego is, it's a destructive effort.

288
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,125
So both things are detrimental to your growth,

289
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:44,917
apart from that, they are extremely dangerous thing for yogis.

290
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,542
So, as you are, in whatever conditions you are,

291
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,083
in whatever situations you are,

292
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:57,458
whatever may be the surroundings,

293
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:06,583
like a dirty mire full of creatures and filth,

294
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,625
you can become like lotuses.

295
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,917
When you become like lotuses

296
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,750
all that is filth, all that is horrible, can become fragrant.

297
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,417
And this is what we have to achieve.

298
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:26,250
When people will see the lotuses they'll come to you,

299
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,125
not to see the worms and to see the filth,

300
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,959
but to see the lotuses.

301
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:38,041
So please, this time, correct yourself,

302
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,542
you don't need anybody to correct you,

303
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,500
you just correct yourself,

304
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,709
watch out for yourself, and see for yourself.

305
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:48,458
If something doesn't work out just give up.

306
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,375
Don't go to extrems for anything.

307
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,999
Must learn to give up at a point

308
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,000
and be happy about it.

309
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,875
If you are contained within yourself,

310
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,417
if your hand is attached to your body,

311
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,208
then you reach up to a point and then leave it,

312
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:08,333
but if it is not attached, if it is disintegrated

313
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,709
then it goes all round and round and round

314
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:13,792
and comes back without anything.

315
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:18,291
That understanding has to be there in you people

316
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,291
because you're standing in the central part,

317
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,500
and you're attached to the central part, not only,

318
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,625
but you are identified with it.

319
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,750
So you cannot go too far to the left,

320
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,583
cannot go too far to the right,

321
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,875
if you do that you get lost.

322
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,709
Then you are no more a Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:39,959
and then no use having you here artificially or superficially

324
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,333
because it will be hypocrisy.

325
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:53,000
Whatever is needed to put you back into right frame you must accept.

326
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,041
And whatever is needed to understand Sahaja Yoga you have to do.

327
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,125
As I have said, please try to learn English language.

328
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:04,083
I cannot learn fourteen languages.

329
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,999
Very difficult.

330
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,917
It's surprising how I have learned this English language also.

331
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,875
So now to learn fourteen languages

332
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:15,208
I've to take fourteen Avataras again.

333
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:17,333
I don't ask you to learn Marathi.

334
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,250
Because that's the best language for Me to speak.

335
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,750
But at least try to learn Engllish.

336
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:27,375
aA d then we can see if you can learn Marathi or Hindi.

337
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,417
[VON 24:28 bis 41:15 TALK IN HINDI OR MARATHI]

338
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:15,208
May God bless you all.

339
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,999
Now We should read the translation in English,

340
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:35,041
because I have told you that Ganesha-principle came as Jesus Christ.

341
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,041
So let Us see the singularity

342
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,083
between the two principles

343
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:46,709
of Shri Ganesha and of Christ.

344
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,333
It's not cleare at all, it's not cleare at all,

345
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:09,999
it's not cleare at all. Will you please adjust it properly

346
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,750
and speak properly. Or get somebody else to speak,

347
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,875
but you must be very clearecut,

348
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,125
Whatever you are saying,

349
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:17,875
you should be able to hear everybody must take.

350
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:20,583
Put your mouth a little away from it, they can't hear it.

351
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,000
It's getting confused.

352
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:26,041
Read it again, please have.

353
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:33,000
Not yet cleare. Can somebody come and read it?

354
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,709
Brian! Come along!

355
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:42,041
See little bit the english language should be understood by Indians.

356
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:46,333
