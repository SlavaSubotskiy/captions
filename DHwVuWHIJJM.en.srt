1
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:14,291
I'm really a proud Mother to see so many Sahaja yogis.

2
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,999
And one must understand

3
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,834
that even if you get few people as newcomers,

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,000
they may be few,

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:34,917
but one has to realize that each one of you

6
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,417
is now a realized soul.

7
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,583
Each one of you have grown so much

8
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:50,041
that you can create a nucleus yourself.

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:57,792
And after growing in a collective way together,

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:09,333
now individually the seedlings have become strong shoots now

11
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:17,792
and they can definitely be transferred into different places

12
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,709
and work it out,

13
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,333
because each one of you is a prophet.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,542
I wonder if you realize it or not.

15
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,917
Of course you have got the joy of realization,

16
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,750
the bliss everything you have got;

17
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:35,959
you have grown up to that.

18
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,875
Slow and steady you have achieved it

19
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,208
and as you have grown as a tree now,

20
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:53,166
every one of you is so important and so powerful.

21
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,875
I know that few people come in, in a collective way,

22
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:01,458
and you find it difficult in the beginning

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,917
how to deal with them.

24
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,208
Because they are still not grown enough;

25
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:11,959
they are still not up to the point

26
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:17,041
where they really realize their own importance.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,125
But you should all understand your own importance

28
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,834
and your own quality that you have achieved.

29
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,000
In any other so-called, fake organizations,

30
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,917
for example say take a church:

31
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,166
there’s only one priest.

32
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,625
In the whole locality there is one priest,

33
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,417
though he doesn’t know anything about it, doesn’t matter.

34
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,750
But still there’s only one person

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,999
who is authorized even by church.

36
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:55,625
Everyone has to listen to one person.

37
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,999
But here, now you all are dynamic people;

38
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:06,291
each one of you is capable of giving a good lecture.

39
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,750
Of course all of you can give realization very well,

40
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,583
no doubt about it.

41
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,166
In all your groups you must try

42
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:20,625
standing on your own legs.

43
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,375
Try in your own groups.

44
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,583
Think of all the dimensions into which you can shoot off.

45
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,291
Because now you are ready;

46
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:34,000
you are now the prophets.

47
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,000
You don’t have to depend on anyone as such,

48
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,999
or you don’t have to depend on

49
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,291
your fellow beings also for that.

50
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,000
Individually you can do it.

51
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,959
Though you are connected with each other,

52
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,999
you all understand the same language,

53
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,959
you have got the truth together and you are all together;

54
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,917
But the dynamism must come individually into you

55
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,458
and every one of you in your own sphere,

56
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,959
in your own line can work it out,

57
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,999
because you know all about Sahaja Yog.

58
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,458
Now those who are half-baked may not know.

59
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,375
They still are rationalizing maybe something,

60
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,583
doesn’t matter, they will also be all right.

61
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,166
But as far as you all are concerned,

62
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,917
you are all prophets

63
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,041
and as prophets you must stand up.

64
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,583
Wherever you go, you talk of Sahaja Yoga,

65
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,875
tell them that, “This has come to us, this is the light.

66
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,166
We know everything.”

67
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,500
I mean you don’t have any doubts about it, isn’t it?

68
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:40,458
But the trouble is, that you feel

69
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,542
that the others may not understand,

70
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,583
they are stupid people, they are foolish people

71
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,000
or they are ego oriented or they’re aggressive

72
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,583
or they’ll do this to you or do that to you.

73
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:59,750
It’s true, but you must know that

74
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,667
there’s not only one person who’s fighting it out,

75
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,834
there are thousands all over the world

76
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,000
who know your language, who know your thing, and

77
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,333
they all know the same thing.

78
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,834
So you are not alone fighting it out.

79
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,041
Once you know that, then you will be amazed

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,999
how much power will start flowing into you.

81
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,999
The more you think about it,

82
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,959
meditate upon your Self now I would say

83
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,041
and know that you yourself you are prophets.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,917
And then you'll see the dimensions into which -

85
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,667
so many are My dimensions sitting here I can see that.

86
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,333
So in every field, in every walk of life,

87
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:47,875
wherever you move,

88
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,834
you have to talk about it and tell people.

89
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:57,291
Now there are certain things, we have made

90
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,208
certain rules and regulations for Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
That is just to see how many are really half-baked

92
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,750
and how many are full-baked.

93
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:13,583
That’s how we have made certain rules and regulations,

94
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,542
because those who are really full-baked

95
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,999
will accept them without any difficulties,

96
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,959
they are absolutely there.

97
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,583
Now as it is we know,

98
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:29,083
there are many categories of people who come to us.

99
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,250
The people who are top class get into Sahaja Yoga

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,875
without any difficulties, they are top class people.

101
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,500
They achieve their powers, they assume their powers,

102
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,542
they start asserting their powers,

103
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,542
they just become that.

104
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:50,500
Like we say we have the complete pattern of the ring with us,

105
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,291
and only we have to put the diamond there.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,709
And you find the diamond all right.

107
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,166
They'll just settle down with it.

108
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,750
But some people, even after realization,

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,917
go a little bit this side, that side,

110
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,208
Doesn’t matter, they’ll all come round.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,417
But those who are top-class people are still,

112
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,250
I must say, are quite a lot.

113
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,500
I mean, I can tell you I know so many gurus

114
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,125
who are real gurus, not these these unreal you forget,

115
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,333
and the fake you forget, but the real ones also,

116
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,709
they haven’t got a single one like that,

117
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,792
not even a single person.

118
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,999
Like Gagangar Maharaj, he told Me very frankly;

119
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,999
I said, “Why don’t you give realization to them?”

120
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,500
He said, “Who gave me realization?

121
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,625
I had to work very hard.” This, that…

122
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,834
“All right,” I said, “You had a guru who gave you realization,

123
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,375
so as a guru it’s your duty to give.”

124
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,583
And he said, “I’ve given it to one person.

125
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,750
I worked on him for twenty five years.

126
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,583
I cleared his Agnya, I cleared everything,

127
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,041
gave him realization.” “And what is he doing now?”

128
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,500
He said, “Now you’ll meet him, Mother, some time.

129
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,291
You must see this fellow, he is horrible

130
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,041
and he’s the one who is now making money,

131
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,750
running after women.”

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,458
After realization, after twenty five years of his work!

133
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,917
He said, “I have nothing to do with this man.”

134
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,125
Now this fellow was called as Anna Maharaj.

135
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,208
I said, “All right, I’ll have a look at him

136
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,959
if he comes to Bombay.”

137
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,792
So he came to Bombay and one of My disciples

138
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,917
had invited him to his house.

139
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,542
She’s quite a rich lady

140
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,750
and she said, “Mother, Anna Maharaj has come

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,458
and You had told that You would like to meet this man

142
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,500
so he’s come here. Would You come?”

143
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,458
Went there, he of course touched My feet all right and that,

144
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,166
but he was smoking in My presence, just imagine.

145
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,375
He touched My feet and sat down.

146
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,458
He said, he started talking ill of his guru, first of all,

147
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:45,999
the one who worked on him for twenty five years,

148
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,125
can you imagine?

149
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,542
I mean you are very kind people; you don’t talk ill of Me.

150
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,458
I’ve not worked for twenty five years on you

151
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,458
and look at him, he was talking ill of his guru.

152
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:58,166
And he said that, “You see, my guru,

153
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,500
why should he go to, why should he go to Bombay?

154
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,041
Now, what is the need?”

155
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,667
Because this fellow was making money in Bombay,

156
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,041
so he didn’t want his guru to go there, to tell against him.

157
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,834
“And why should he go to Bombay?

158
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,208
He should not leave his place?

159
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,542
He was all right on the, on top of the mountain.

160
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,667
What was the need for him to come down?”

161
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,709
and all sorts of things he was talking there.

162
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,166
I said, “Really?

163
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,166
That is your guru, you are not to talk ill of him.”

164
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,375
He said, “But this is true.

165
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,166
He need not have left the place, you see?”

166
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,667
And he was still smoking here.

167
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,041
I said, “All right, now I have to go.”

168
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,709
With so many women around him

169
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,417
pressing his feet, this that,

170
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,709
taking a lot of milk and enjoying himself and smoking

171
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,999
and talking in a very condescending manner

172
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
to his, so-called disciples.

173
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,083
Poor things, they were simple people you know.

174
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,709
I said, “All right, I have to go now.

175
00:09:53,875 --> 00:10:00,375
So you just put some,

176
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:07,667
I’ll give you some kumkum on your forehead.”

177
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,625
So I took some kumkum and put it on his forehead.

178
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,208
So his Agnya was just burning, oh,

179
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,417
absolutely My finger went like this!

180
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,667
I said, “That’s it.” “Now,”

181
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,417
I said, “All right now can you I’m going now,

182
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,333
you put some on My forehead.”

183
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,000
And I sucked his finger inside, he couldn’t move it.

184
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,250
Just like that, it was all …

185
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:34,917
And he said, “Leave me, leave me,

186
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,959
Mother, I’m sorry, I am sorry!” I said,

187
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,250
“Now! You just promise you’ll not talk ill of your guru,

188
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,792
then only I’ll leave you.”

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,333
He said, “All right, all right, all right!

190
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,041
Please leave me!”

191
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,999
So I left the finger.

192
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:53,500
But see now, the Sahaja yogini lady who was there,

193
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,125
who has been saved from so many problems

194
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,125
because she was a clairvoyant person,

195
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,250
to her he told a lie, is complete lie.

196
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,959
He said, “I was giving power to Mother.”

197
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,792
You see they saw it from a distance.

198
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,417
“So I was shaking because I was giving power” -

199
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,625
you know, means this shaking was giving Me power!

200
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,999
But this lady should have understood that when you shake

201
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,208
it means there’s something wrong with you.

202
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,667
And you know she said that, “Now I will give you

203
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,999
also such powers as came to Mother.”

204
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,125
That time it was just the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

205
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,125
I should say, quite the beginning.

206
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:34,333
“So now you better have a Yagya. Hom.

207
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,458
For that all of you must bring

208
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,208
one and a quarter tola of gold” -

209
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,792
that’s about 10 grams.

210
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,959
“and give it to me.”

211
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,625
That was the beginning of the end.

212
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
Now all their money, all their property,

213
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,250
everything he sucked in somehow.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,834
And her sister met Me when I was traveling

215
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,041
once from Delhi to Bombay

216
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,166
and she just fell at My feet and started crying.

217
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,417
I said, “What’s the matter?”

218
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,000
She said, “Mother this fellow has looted us.” I said, “Who?”

219
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,999
“The Anna Maharaj.” I said, “How?

220
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,500
But that day you saw him shaking.

221
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,041
That’s the thing.”

222
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:17,166
So how she was befooled by this fellow

223
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,583
who told her a complete lie?

224
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,166
If she had seen the vibrations of this man

225
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,750
it would have been all right

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,500
and this is what Sahaja yogis forget.

227
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,375
They are prophets, they have their powers

228
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,583
but their power is their Spirit, is their vibrations

229
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,959
and they forget it all the time that,

230
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,792
“We have got a new awareness, vibratory awareness.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
We have to judge everything on vibrations,”

232
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,458
and that’s the only failing point of all the prophets.

233
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,291
If it is untruth -

234
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:57,000
I am very innocent you know, I’m very simple minded,

235
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,208
I just don’t understand things at all.

236
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,041
You see I don’t know the crookery of man

237
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,750
how he goes round and tells lies and this,

238
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,333
but on vibrations I know what it is like - absolutely.

239
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,000
You may tell Me any stories:

240
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,750
with all your crookery, with all your intelligence

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,417
and all your special sharpness.

242
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,417
I know what you are up to,

243
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,834
because only I know it with vibrations.

244
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,875
But otherwise I am very simple,

245
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,125
I can’t rationally or anything I can understand,

246
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,375
but by vibrations I know where you are.

247
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,417
In the same way you develop your vibratory awareness,

248
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,125
its sensitivity and try to understand things

249
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,083
through vibratory awareness.

250
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:44,417
If you can do that then you will be perfect prophets.

251
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,291
You’ll be perfect prophets.

252
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:52,375
Now among ourselves also you’ll find there are people

253
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:55,166
who are not up to the point.

254
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,667
Such people should never be trusted,

255
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,625
should never be trusted because they are half-baked,

256
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,291
they might become negative, they might become positive.

257
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,959
So they should not be trusted

258
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,041
and they should be treated with little reserve.

259
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,959
Once they become all right

260
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:16,834
then you can take them into your own fold.

261
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,250
For example recently a girl married

262
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,125
somebody who is a great Sahaja yogi.

263
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,375
Now because he said he loved her and all that nonsense,

264
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,208
so I said, “All right baba you marry her.”

265
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,917
But I knew that this one is no good, but what to say?

266
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:36,542
And then this lady tried, actually she travelled with Me

267
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,792
and she tried even to clutch My heart

268
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,500
with the bhoots she had, absolutely.

269
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,917
Twice she did it.

270
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,709
So cunning, the spirits are so cunning in her,

271
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,166
that when she went back to Australia, you see,

272
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,792
she put up a show in such a way that,

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,250
“Oh, she is so insecured

274
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,458
and her husband doesn’t care for her and this and that.

275
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,000
And the whole of that Ashram,

276
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,208
just imagine, would have been lost.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,500
But I knew something was happening so I trunk called.

278
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:15,000
Immediately I found out. I told them, now,

279
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,208
"see her vibrations!”

280
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,166
They said, “Mother we don’t find anything wrong with her.”

281
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,999
That means they never saw her vibration to begin with.

282
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,041
Because what happens once vibrations are lost,

283
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,792
you can’t feel anything.

284
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,959
She has engulfed all of them so much

285
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,500
that they couldn’t feel anything about her.

286
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,125
Can you imagine?

287
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,999
Then rationally I asked a question,

288
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:48,999
“Can you replace Warren for his wife?”

289
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,458
And they got a fright.

290
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,959
So, one has to be very, very alert about it,

291
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,750
extremely alert as to these people who are half-baked.

292
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,667
They will always try to pull you down.

293
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,000
Half-baked people will always try to pull you down,

294
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,625
unless and until you are firm enough to pull them up.

295
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:15,500
Because they are not doing it, they are not aware of it,

296
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:21,083
but they are under the possession of these people,

297
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:22,959
and when they do something,

298
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,083
they try to do all anti-God activities.

299
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:31,417
Another one I’ll tell you was in

300
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,291
Geneva.

301
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,375
In the beginning I don’t tell openly about a person.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,291
As far as possible I don’t tell openly

303
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:49,667
because it’s not proper.

304
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,208
Give them a chance, they’ll come up,

305
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,333
it will work out, doesn’t matter.

306
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:56,834
I can manage it.

307
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,959
But when the nuisance becomes a collective thing,

308
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,375
then one has to talk about it openly;

309
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,834
you see, because these people will go to one person,

310
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,999
say something, another person something,

311
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,166
third person something.

312
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,125
So you have to be very alert.

313
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,709
And they are not aware of it -

314
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,208
that’s the best part of it,

315
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,999
they are not aware of what they are doing.

316
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,125
Like this lady in Geneva would go on asking everyone,

317
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,000
“What do you think about Mr. X or Mr. Y?”

318
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,667
All right, so you would say something, if you are negative,

319
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,500
she would catch hold of that.

320
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,583
Day before yesterday I was very happy when Ray told Me

321
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:39,875
something good about Pamela.

322
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,625
He said, “Pamela is a very artistic Lady.”

323
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,291
When you start seeing good points in others

324
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,709
it gives Me pleasure,

325
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,166
it gives Me happiness, it gives Me joy.

326
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,166
But if you start seeing bad points in another

327
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
then I don’t like it.

328
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:00,917
Sometimes of course when you - I also test you on that point.

329
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,709
Sometimes I’ll say something, you see, deliberately:

330
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,000
I’ll say, “All right something wrong with Ray” -

331
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,250
I may say.

332
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,291
I know about whether it is wrong or right,

333
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:15,000
just to judge how far you can judge that person.

334
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,542
Then if you say supporting

335
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,750
to the right thing that he’s doing,

336
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,333
then I know that you are right.

337
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,083
I like it, I appreciate you,

338
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,291
I really adore you for that.

339
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,750
That whatever is the truth you should tell Me,

340
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,792
because I know the truth,

341
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,125
but I just play around with you

342
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,417
to see what you think of another person.

343
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,750
So try to see the good point in another.

344
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,625
But on one point you should understand,

345
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,917
if a person is quarrelsome,

346
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:53,709
is trying to overpower you

347
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,458
Birmingham we have a problem like that,

348
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,709
which I have not yet exposed or said so.

349
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,625
Still I have kept a secret but I am telling people

350
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,959
that in Birmingham there’s a problem,

351
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,667
and that problem comes from one person

352
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,375
who is not aware of it.

353
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,750
I will talk to that person; tell that person

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,333
that he should get rid of this problem.

355
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,625
But if he does not then I have to tell about it openly,

356
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,500
because I don’t want Birmingham center to be lost.

357
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,166
We would have lost Geneva;

358
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,291
I tell you we would have lost it.

359
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,000
Everybody went against each other

360
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:37,125
and big problems were created, by one person.

361
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,291
Though you are full-baked,

362
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,417
still you are not so collectively aware

363
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,166
and appreciative of others, as you should be.

364
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:49,834
You are all one.

365
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,208
Not only appreciation but you can’t do without each other.

366
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,792
So slow and-steady, as the English character is,

367
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,500
which is a very good character but it can be very slow.

368
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:12,999
Slow-and-steady you must rise about, above your own shells

369
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,041
and see the beauty of another Sahaja yogi

370
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,000
and see the point that are good in that person

371
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,291
so that you imbibe.

372
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,583
Some people have certain capacities.

373
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:30,834
And surprisingly then, I talked to Pamela about Ray

374
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,999
and she praised him a lot

375
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,458
and that really made Me extremely happy,

376
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,667
though I must say Brighton may not have been

377
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:42,500
so bright yesterday in the program,

378
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,834
there were few people but doesn’t matter.

379
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,875
This is very energy giving

380
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,208
to see that Sahaja yogis appreciate each other.

381
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,166
Now somebody has a problem,

382
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,333
say left-sided people always have a problem in My lecture;

383
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,999
they go off to sleep,

384
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,583
naturally, they have to. [Laughter]

385
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,250
It doesn’t matter whatsoever,

386
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,417
I am working on them even if they are sleeping.

387
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,166
But when I work on them

388
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,625
I have to sleep Myself to go into them, see?

389
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,583
So that drag is there, it doesn’t matter it will come up.

390
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,875
There are ways and methods of how to work it out.

391
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,041
But that’s not so important to Me,

392
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
what is important is, are you sleeping

393
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,999
towards your fellow men,

394
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,458
fellow Sahaja yogis?

395
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,375
Are you alert about them?

396
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:47,083
They are just like your hands, eyes, nose, everything.

397
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,834
You are all one.

398
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,959
You cannot do without each other,

399
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,458
because you are the only people

400
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:57,291
who have now got the eyes to see.

401
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,625
You are the only people who are aware.

402
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,458
And we are not few.

403
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,667
We think that we are very few.

404
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,542
You see , maybe then the other gurus they might get

405
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,999
thousands of them, they are useless -

406
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,875
as they go, they come out.

407
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:20,792
Maybe added up, tails and horns they might have!

408
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,917
But they are not aware people.

409
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,083
And you are aware.

410
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,834
On one side you have to pull out the people

411
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,125
who are not aware so much,

412
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,458
on the other side you have to appreciate people

413
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,083
who are more aware.

414
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,583
And this is what one has to understand.

415
00:22:47,792 --> 00:22:50,166
with little less than what it is.

416
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,792
I have to tell you, you should say it with little more,

417
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,375
if you have to make the bull move you see?

418
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,000
Say little more than you can say

419
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,917
because whatever you say is not more, and

420
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,709
this is the Infinite.

421
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,875
But it should not be also so much that they can’t bear it.

422
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:17,375
Like Warren had an experience which I told him,

423
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,750
“Only tell the Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell anybody else

424
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,458
because they’ll never believe it.”

425
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,041
There was no petrol in his car

426
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,458
and he had to go for a propaganda work

427
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,917
and he went round.

428
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,917
And he did all his propaganda for eight days

429
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,250
and when they came back the petrol was not available.

430
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,458
At the petrol pump the fellow said,

431
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,250
“Your petrol is full, why do you want to have petrol in?”

432
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,208
Why not?

433
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,250
That can be done,

434
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,041
but don’t tell anybody else because they’ll just say

435
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,750
this is cock-and-bull story, you see.

436
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:02,291
You see you have heard the story of the bread and the fishes.

437
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,208
Because in the Bible it is so, we believe it.

438
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,625
Why not today?

439
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,917
You have seen so many things happening like that,

440
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:13,875
I mean so many things in your own lifetime.

441
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,667
But all these things if you tell them, they won’t believe.

442
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:22,375
So your wisdom is in believing

443
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:25,959
that you are in the realm of God and He is Almighty,

444
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,500
and that He is going to give you

445
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:31,041
everything that you want and aspire for.

446
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,166
People won’t believe it I know.

447
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:44,291
But it’s true, whatever is desired you can get it,

448
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,417
but if you tell people they won’t believe.

449
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,083
But as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

450
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,250
you have to make a statement

451
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:56,667
which is not reserved but open,

452
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,500
with confidence.

453
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,834
The diffidence that is put into it

454
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:06,291
because of this training is not good.

455
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,999
With confidence, “Yes it is so! It is so!

456
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,625
This is what it is.”

457
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:26,625
Like first when I went to India, Raul Bai,

458
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,834
you know such an elderly lady, an Indian lady

459
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,667
they feel little shy about everything.

460
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,041
She’s the one with full hand up in the air.

461
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,875
She was shouting, “Bolo Mataji Nirmala Devi!”

462
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,041
and Modi looked at her, he couldn’t raise his hand, you see.

463
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,417
He was a little shy.

464
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,959
But she went thrice and then she lifted his hand and said,

465
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,250
“What’s the matter with you, such a tall man?

466
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,250
Why God has given you height for what?

467
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,709
To raise your hands only.”

468
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,542
And poor fellow he had to raise his hand.

469
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,667
So that’s what it is.

470
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,917
Have boldness,

471
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,834
have complete confidence in your self,

472
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,959
that you are realized souls,

473
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,458
that you are prophets.

474
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:14,458
Not to be upset or worried about things

475
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:16,250
but you are prophets now.

476
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,166
Assumption!

477
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,000
In Sanskrit is said viraj.

478
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:30,542
That is the energy is permeated -

479
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:35,583
viraj: means enjoy that energy within you.

480
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:37,667
Viraj, “Ra” is energy;

481
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:42,208
“Viraj” means you enjoy that energy of that throne,

482
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,834
assume it.

483
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,500
You are the kings now, behave in that manner.

484
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:52,458
It is not arrogance at all.

485
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,834
A person who is a king is never arrogant,

486
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,083
if he’s a real king.

487
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,458
You see if they are borrowed kings then it’s different.

488
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:02,125
But if they are real kings they can never be arrogant.

489
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:09,834
So with that special type of royal behavior

490
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,250
you will attract people.

491
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,208
It’s not putting up show, is you are!

492
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,834
On the contrary this is the reservation you are having,

493
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,208
for what?

494
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:29,375
You need not dress up like beggars or like dandies,

495
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:33,166
but your dress should be such that you are a king,

496
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,999
not bothered.

497
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,999
And you’ll be amazed it will work out.

498
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:46,500
You are the people who have the greatest of My time

499
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,208
and company

500
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:52,125
and also I know your language.

501
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,792
I have given more speeches in English than in Mine own,

502
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,333
My own mother tongue or in Hindi. Can you believe it?

503
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,667
And so many Indians now,

504
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,125
who did not much care for English after independence,

505
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,999
are trying to learn English now

506
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,250
and they are afraid that one day

507
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,417
English may replace Sanskrit,

508
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,792
the way Mother knows English.

509
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:26,041
So, I have to make a very, very simple request to you,

510
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,959
that assume, assume your powers.

511
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,625
Assume.

512
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,917
You are no more slaves.

513
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,083
You are realized souls now.

514
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:46,667
With this personality

515
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:51,083
you will really enhance the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

516
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,834
Unless and until there are flowers on the tree,

517
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,458
the tree has no meaning

518
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,667
and the flowers have to be up!

519
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,041
They don’t hide,

520
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,917
have you ever seen any flower hiding itself?

521
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:10,792
They cover the whole of the body of the trees and fragrant,

522
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,625
assuming their own powers.

523
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,709
And the fragrance springs.

524
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,917
Everybody knows the flowers are up,

525
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,542
all the bees are round there.

526
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,999
That’s how you have to be.

527
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:28,333
Assume your powers - inside, outside, both.

528
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,500
Not only inside, outside and in side.

529
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,000
And they’ll be amazed at your confidence,

530
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:35,667
at your compassion,

531
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:38,917
at your capacities and the greatest of all,

532
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,250
the complete vidya,

533
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:45,083
the complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

534
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,375
the complete knowledge of Kundalini,

535
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,667
the complete the complete knowledge of Divine which you have.

536
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:57,834
All right?

537
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:24,333
Now Gavin, whichever way you want,

538
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,166
you can do the puja.

539
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,166
Gavin, come along …

540
00:30:55,709 --> 00:31:00,083
You should have names and things. And Marcus.

541
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,959
Ganesh Puja, Mother?

542
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,000
Ganesha has come!

543
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,999
So you also know Sanskrit ….

544
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,917
Both are learning Sanskrit.

545
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,083
Yogi: Should all those who haven’t done

546
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,500
Your puja before be called up?

547
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:12,834
All right, but not absolutely new people.

548
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:17,583
Not absolutely new, but those …

549
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,333
If they want to do it, it’s all right.

550
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:29,208
But you see, the problem is they’re absolutely new people.

551
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,959
But in France is worked...

552
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,542
Yogi: Some people have come from outside

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,333
and may not have had a puja.

554
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,500
Outside from where?

555
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,083
Yes, there’s a gentleman from Devon, Mother.

556
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:49,999
Is there? Good, that’s nice. And also, you see, in France

557
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,959
it really clicked there.

558
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:54,166
We had the puja next day and we called those people

559
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,999
who got realization. And they really clicked, you see,

560
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:00,000
they were very sensible because they were seekers.

561
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,583
They understood the meaning, and not only these Algerians ….

562
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:05,875
These Muslims, how good they were –

563
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,458
absolutely top-class.

564
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,166
Top-class people, you know.

565
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,458
What’s his name, that lawyer?

566
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,917
Aychala. He’s a wonderful man, isn’t it?

567
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:37,917
His wife … And he said, “This is the Resurrection Time;

568
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,667
what is there to question?”

569
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,500
And he’s a lawyer, and his wife also?

570
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,417
I tell you, he brought fourteen people by plane. Yes, he did.

571
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,458
All right.

572
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,792
So if the new people do not form any barrier,

573
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:13,291
it’s all right. They can come and wash My feet.

574
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,542
It helps always.

575
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,834
But if you have barriers, don’t do it.

576
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,583
Just don’t do it. You see, it doesn’t help Me,

577
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:24,834
it helps you. Some people think that by washing My feet,

578
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,291
I can save one washing or whatever it is!

579
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:39,750
So it’s a privilege, and if you have to do it,

580
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,750
you should do it – is good for you,

581
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,999
you’ll immediately settle down into your realization.

582
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,083
So those who are new people can come.

583
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,458
And you have to wash My feet first of all.

584
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,000
He understands so much, I tell you!

585
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:05,250
My grandchildren, they are –

586
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,542
they understand the protocol so much.

587
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,750
He took off My socks and put on top of the head of – his top!

588
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,917
They understand so much, it’s …

589
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:24,542
Nick was telling Me that we have to learn

590
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,417
from children so many protocols.

591
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,125
He took it out for Me today, she said,

592
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,959
for puja evening, and I think I’ll leave it to use.

593
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:39,291
So, those people who are new, please come.

594
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:40,667
They should do the puja.

595
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,458
They have the privilege,

596
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:45,917
not the one who … Who has come from Devon?

597
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:53,750
Great! Come along. Come along, come along. Good.

598
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,458
As from Brighton who are the people

599
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,875
who should come and wash My feet,

600
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,542
because that’s the best way to settle you down

601
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,792
into your realization.

602
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,792
He is to be the first?

603
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,000
They understand the privileges. Very good.

604
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,417
I think Paul, I think you should wash My feet,

605
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,417
better wash My feet. Good. Aha, that’s good.

606
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,834
Better take a mantra.

607
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:47,875
By the way, whom did I give that thing

608
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,750
I had brought for you that … day?

609
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:55,625
To wash My feet? Whom did I donate it?

610
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,667
Did I give it to you people?

611
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:07,041
The big thing. No, no, recently.

612
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:12,917
Ask Marcus. Marcus, we had that silver thing, big thing?

613
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,834
Big thing like this?

614
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,750
No, no, not that.

615
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,083
It was from England only.

616
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:40,542
I think the Lane. Must be there.

617
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,999
Yogi: You gave me one at Your house, Mother,

618
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,792
to give to Nightingale Lane.

619
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:55,250
Did I? Where is it? You must bring that.

620
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:56,834
You see, that’s a very good one.

621
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,083
It’s surprising that, that I had it with Me,

622
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,917
this was from England, and I brought it back for you.

623
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,500
Made in England, can you imagine? In Sheffield!

624
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:16,041
So I brought it back to you, that you can use it.

625
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:18,542
So next time you bring that, because stainless steel is

626
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,750
not so good as that thing is, you see?

627
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,125
So now, you will say the mantras, no?

628
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,834
With Shri Ganesha’s, first of all.

629
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,291
Have you got that?

630
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,500
… So how will you do it on My feet?

631
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,291
On My feet you use the ghee with this.

632
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:53,125
Little bit of this coconut should be saved for after this ….

633
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,542
All right. Hundred-and-eight names.

634
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,458
But he has got translation, necessary too – oh, that one.

635
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:08,125
Let him read his translation of,

636
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,792
because this is for the new people.

637
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,333
This is the Shri Ganesha

638
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,583
who incarnated as our Lord Jesus Christ,

639
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:21,333
and this was written fourteen thousand years back.

640
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,500
It’s been translated, so you can see now

641
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,999
how His coming was already there,

642
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,667
and how the things that are written in here

643
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:33,291
show the complete picture of Christ – which He is,

644
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:34,875
which people do not know, you see.

645
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,458
They talk of Christ, Christ, Christ – what Christ is?

646
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,583
Let’s see.

647
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,291
Now, Gavin, can you stand up and read it?

648
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,667
No, no, that’s all right, forward it, just forward it.

649
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:50,458
Now, who will – why don’t you ask somebody to read,

650
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,959
because we have to come ….

651
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,125
Jeremy? Read it, loudly.

652
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:41,750
Let all the children to wash My feet.

653
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,667
Let the children do it first.

654
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,250
That’s better. Shona!

655
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,834
Let Olympia come in.

656
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,125
Olympia, come here.

657
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,875
Come, come.

658
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:25,917
Who else is there?

659
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,041
You’ll have to wash My feet. All right?

660
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,083
Everybody has to wash My feet. Come along.

661
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:39,709
Now sit down there.

662
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,834
Everybody’s going to wash My feet. All right?

663
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,750
That’s it. Now come along. Get the water. Amit, sit down.

664
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,208
Take out your shoes. Must take out shoes ….

665
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:59,458
Sit down, sit down …

666
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:05,709
Sit down, sit down. Sit down here, just like that.

667
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:10,875
Please sit down. Now will you sit down! Sit down!

668
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,875
Sit down. Now put the water, come along.

669
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,208
You put the water, just come along …

670
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,959
ow see everybody’s doing it. Come along.

671
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:28,375
Aha! Who will do it? Oh, oh, all right.

672
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:45,959
Give him that hand.

673
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,792
Where is that – Katie?

674
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,125
Just call her.

675
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,834
Right hand, right hand, you give the right hand.

676
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,792
No, no, no, don’t cry.

677
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,583
Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Where is Katie? Call Katie.

678
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,709
Now wash it, wash it. Come along, come along.

679
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,917
Come along, come along. She can do it.

680
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:10,625
She can do it. She’s big now. She can do it. ….

681
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:18,375
It’s all right now, see, it’s cool breeze coming.

682
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,999
Good, good, good. Come along, Katie, come along.

683
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,875
Katie has come, see?

684
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,166
ow Katie has come. Come along, Katie.

685
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,834
Come along, Katie, you do it.

686
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,125
See, everybody’s doing it.

687
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:01,333
All the children are doing it. All right.

688
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,542
You see, this is what is the point,

689
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:23,709
that when you get realization the spirit is awakened –

690
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:27,250
that is Christ – and that you listen.

691
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:31,083
“His presence in you”: with that you listen.

692
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:34,333
Means with the spirit, you see, the point is.

693
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:38,542
That’s what He said: the Comforter will come and

694
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,917
He will, or She will, whatever it is,

695
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,125
will make you comfort in such a way that you

696
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:51,542
will reside forever in My Father –

697
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:54,291
or would remember My Father forever.

698
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:56,959
That’s the spirit you remember.

699
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,083
That’s the spirit, you see? See now, hear this.

700
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:29,709
Can you imagine, he’s here!

701
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,375
You have never washed it ….

702
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:42,917
Grace, you rub with your hands in the water.

703
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,792
Just rub it. Come along. Just rub it, in the water.

704
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:48,750
Rub hard. You have to rub with your fingers.

705
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:50,458
You see, My Feet are perfectly all right.

706
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,250
Nothing happens to Them.

707
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:55,500
Rub as hard as you can.

708
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,041
Yogi: The names of the Goddess, as Shri Lalita.

709
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,625
Loudly, now, you stand up.

710
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,834
Would you do it?

711
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,291
Good idea, because … Can you put it for him?

712
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,166
All right, just stand here …

713
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:24,625
Translation, otherwise these people won’t understand.

714
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:17,542
Can you sit down, would be better.

715
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:21,083
We can … Mother Earth … vibrations.

716
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:22,875
Very loudly now.

717
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,417
Can you put “sakshat”, that would be better …

718
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,083
Not so much.

719
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,291
“Mataji Nirmala Devi” would be better ….

720
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,250
At the beginning you say.

721
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,792
Once you’ve said it, it’s all right.

722
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,333
Now you’ll be sure of it, all right?

723
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,999
May God bless you.

724
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:46,792
She’s sure of it. It’s better now.

725
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:05,125
These are all the secrets of ….

726
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
All right, but you don’t see that ….

727
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,166
All the horrifying things you have chosen there to read!

728
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:29,959
Ra, Ra-dha: is to .… means the one, “Ra” is the energy …

729
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,999
which permeates, permeates.

730
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,709
Radha is … Ra is energy of Radha.

731
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,917
Again horrifying things now!

732
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:15,000
In the beginning they’d say all horrifying things

733
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,542
to settle you down, I think, that’s why ….

734
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,917
All right.

735
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:26,834
All right, now go ahead.

736
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:43,792
Sugar-cane now!

737
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,750
She’s the causal elements.

738
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:00,125
Causal elements, you see? Causal.

739
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:06,667
Like the causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance.

740
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,917
Fragrance is the causal of the Mother Earth.

741
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:50,125
You see, the emission of vibrations through the aura

742
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,999
engulfs all the other auras into it

743
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,917
All the Mother Earth.

744
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:32,625
That means …. She’s full moon of musk.

745
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,500
She’s full moon of musk.

746
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,000
They, you see, they have tried to put

747
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,625
all poetic ideas to describe something.

748
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:47,542
You see, the thing is, it’s a difference:

749
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,417
it’s beauty and auspiciousness.

750
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,875
Auspiciousness is the face, you see,

751
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:57,667
that gives you shubha – shubha means “that brings good luck.”

752
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,041
The face you see brings you good luck.

753
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,583
That is known as auspicious.

754
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,667
Of course, I mean, modern people don’t believe

755
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,500
in such a face like that, that there could be a face.

756
01:03:08,834 --> 01:03:11,667
But there can be a face which if you see,

757
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:15,999
then it brings you good luck. Auspicious.

758
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,083
Yogi: Salutations to Her, the diamonds

759
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,834
of whose nose outshine even the stars.

760
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:06,792
That’s why I don’t wear anything there!

761
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:44,333
It’s of the joy of beauty. So the Sahaja yogis enjoy

762
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:48,458
the beauty of those flowers which She wears.

763
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,333
Because of vibrations, it’s that.

764
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:54,542
You see, it’s a simple thing is that anything

765
01:04:54,917 --> 01:04:56,792
You touch becomes vibrated,

766
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,625
and if you see that particular flower you are more happy,

767
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,208
because it’s had vibrations.

768
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,709
Vibration is the one which only gives this.

769
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:09,125
Lotus of – the lotus of love. ….

770
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,750
Which means, which comes out of the kapol.

771
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,125
It is the description.

772
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,375
Kapol is this one, so this is the part they are describing.

773
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:57,959
See, padmaraag, padmaraag is the fragrance of the lotus.

774
01:06:58,417 --> 01:07:01,917
Is the raag, means the energy of the lotus is coming out

775
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,834
of Her forehead.

776
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:08,333
No, from this, kapal and this is kapol.

777
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:12,166
Kapol is – I’m sorry: this is kapal, this is kapol, cheeks.

778
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:21,000
The energy that flows from the cheeks is the energy

779
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:26,291
of the raag, means, raag actually means love,

780
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:30,709
compassion – of a lotus.

781
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:47,583
Like the new leaves.

782
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:52,458
Vidru is “new leaves,” you see. Like the new leaves.

783
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:06,917
What is the translation?

784
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,041
It’s a very big thing, but it’s very poetic,

785
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:27,000
it’s rather embarrassing.

786
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,583
It’s rather embarrassing! All right.

787
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:45,583
Blue. Like the blue leaves, you see, of that color.

788
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:48,583
You see the color of the new leaves –

789
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,083
isn’t it pinkish-red, isn’t it?

790
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,542
So Her lips are of that color,

791
01:08:53,959 --> 01:08:57,667
which will put shame to even those blue leaves,

792
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,750
newly-born leaves, you see, pink ones.

793
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:31,667
Yes, but they are the controller of the Nirmala Vidya;

794
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:35,458
Shuddha Vidya – pure knowledge.

795
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:42,875
These are, teeth are the manifestation –

796
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:46,333
they manifest pure knowledge.

797
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:54,166
It’s the primules of all the Vidyas. Primules.

798
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,834
Camphor is to be applied. And betel is to be eaten,

799
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:29,375
– which I don’t eat, you see.

800
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:08,125
Sanlap means “auspicious.” Alap is the report, report.

801
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,291
Report. So …. You see, to be very frank,

802
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,291
it’s very embarrassing.

803
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,959
You’d better read it. ….

804
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,625
No, no, that’s what is written there:

805
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:43,542
like the music of veena, divine music of veena. Saraswati.

806
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:22,500
See, in a subtler form you must see all these things.

807
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,500
You don’t see that, all the strains, you see.

808
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,208
In a subtler form, diamonds are the things which radiate –

809
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:33,375
they radiate, you see.

810
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:38,291
So when they say the diamonds around the neck,

811
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:41,417
it’s not question of wearing it outside;

812
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:46,250
it’s a question of radiating that love.

813
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,542
So the necklace, necklace is useful.

814
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:51,542
But now, you are My diamonds in My necklace,

815
01:14:51,917 --> 01:14:55,125
so why should I wear any diamonds anymore?

816
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,291
Cosmic, that’s it.

817
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:11,999
You see, when She didn’t have Her own diamonds,

818
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:16,333
and the one that She did have, She used to wear

819
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,999
those diamonds, all right.

820
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:22,166
But now you have living diamonds, so what’s the need?

821
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:24,875
They were used to radiate Her power.

822
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,250
Now you don’t need anything;

823
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:29,625
you are the ones who are going to radiate the powers.

824
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,834
Yogi: We are the ornaments of Mataji, that’s what we should

825
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:36,792
understand and we should try to keep ourselves clean

826
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,250
that we radiant maximum...

827
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,208
Yogi: Self cleaning jewels.

828
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,417
That’s it.

829
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,291
All built-in!

830
01:16:46,999 --> 01:16:49,083
I think we’d better not translate it, better not.

831
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,083
It is more about the breast of the Mother.

832
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:55,959
Because the children are worried about the breast,

833
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:59,417
so it’s described here, so it’s better not.

834
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,458
No, no, no, better not.

835
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:13,750
You see, this is written by, for people like Markandeya,

836
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,166
and they described Mother in and out.

837
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:18,417
I don’t know how they found the Mother like that, you see,

838
01:17:18,792 --> 01:17:20,542
because they are children.

839
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,333
You see, so they were the children.

840
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:24,959
So the children know everything about the Mother in and out,

841
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:28,125
see, so described the whole birth.

842
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,583
There are three folds.

843
01:18:22,583 --> 01:18:23,959
The Mother is ...three folds.

844
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,125
That’s why it’s called as...

845
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:42,375
Very embarrassing!

846
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:18,000
Kamesha is...He’s the God of all the desires.

847
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,667
“Kama” is “desire.” That’s why He’s placed in the Heart.

848
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:45,500
Too much of an arch. Can’t wear modern shoes! ....

849
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:39,709
They took a photograph – you were there –

850
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,083
but one of the photographs where they just saw

851
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,625
the flames coming out of My feet …. Maha Shivratri.

852
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,500
You see, all this is being said because by saying

853
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,083
these things you excite these powers,

854
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,792
you see – they feel happy, they get excited.

855
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:38,959
And it is nothing special for Me because if it is Mine,

856
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:41,583
it’s nothing special. It’s just there.

857
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:45,834
But one has to know that why you get Realization so fast,

858
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:48,875
because must be something special about Me.

859
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,917
Why you got Realization so quickly?

860
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:54,542
I look like you, behave like you, everything is like you.

861
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:58,041
But there’s something very subtle with it,

862
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:00,458
which is very dynamic, and you must understand

863
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,625
the cosmic nature of the Mother.

864
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,500
That’s how it will explain how you all are getting

865
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,000
Realization, how you are giving Realization to others.

866
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:14,875
That’s why all these description are being given by the seers,

867
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:17,542
who are of a very high quality people, you see.

868
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:19,667
They are very subtler, but the subtler you grow,

869
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:24,250
the more you understand My powers, and your own powers too.

870
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:29,291
But it’s such a mutual understanding, you see;

871
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:30,999
like the more you open your eyes,

872
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:33,999
the more you see the sunlight. In the same way it is.

873
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:37,999
But there must be something about Me,

874
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:39,750
that you are getting Realization,

875
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:43,500
and that something is this description.

876
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,875
Yogi: They say that the Goddess is so great

877
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,875
that even Lord Ganesha looks only at Her feet.

878
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:54,291
He never looks up to see Her face.

879
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:57,875
But not Sahaja yogis, are all right. They are excused.

880
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:01,542
They are meant more than any other deities,

881
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,500
and they are treated like that.

882
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:06,417
First with children, you see, the deities also are very,

883
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:10,166
very good, very, very kind.

884
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:12,792
They know they are on the stage and they are

885
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,834
to be looked after, and they are therefore My favorite ones.

886
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,625
Yogi says there is another description that

887
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:23,709
the Goddess’s toenails do not need to be cut,

888
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:26,333
because they are clipped by the jewels

889
01:25:26,999 --> 01:25:29,875
of the deities’ crowns as they bow at Her feet.

890
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,041
It’s true, I seldom do that.

891
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:40,999
But sometimes I think I have to, because when you

892
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,959
people come on My Feet –

893
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:44,792
you are not Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshas –

894
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:48,792
you should not get hurt.

895
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,709
See, you don’t have any crowns!

896
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,792
See, at the right time!

897
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:24,500
Brighton married ladies.

898
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:53,125
Yogi: Salutations to Her, whose Lord is within Her power.

899
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:56,542
Hm. Just imagine!

900
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,625
Yogi: The meaning of this is that one can only

901
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:03,709
approach the Absolute through Mataji.

902
01:29:04,375 --> 01:29:09,542
That’s Her power. You see, even the, even the control

903
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:14,542
of the Shiva, Sadashiva, is in the hands

904
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,875
of the Mother is not true, to that extent.

905
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,458
Yogi: But you are His, the manifestation of His power.

906
01:29:20,959 --> 01:29:24,417
It’s true; but you see, My love is,

907
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:27,583
compassion is quite a lot, much more.

908
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:31,291
I’m not wrathful.

909
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:35,125
But if you people misbehave too much, then He’s wrathful.

910
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,291
I may not be able to control.

911
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:42,625
Then I have to witness the wrath of God.

912
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,083
He’s compassion, He’s love, He’s innocence –

913
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:51,083
everything is there, but He’s wrathful.

914
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:55,125
So be careful what you want to do.
