1
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,200
but

2
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,320
I don’t know what to say!

3
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
You are living in this house now

4
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:17,720
and it was very nice because Sahaja Yogis were living here and they enjoyed my stay here.

5
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,060
but

6
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,060
We have to change

7
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,580
and progress that’s the point is

8
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,520
With every change you must progress otherwise it has no meaning, the change has no meaning.

9
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,860
So now they are thinking that I should now be in the house here.

10
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,720
I think it’s a good idea.

11
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:07,620
Shri Mataji we’d like to thank you for coming to live here in Ealing and in this house for so long.

12
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,560
And we know that, from this house, all kinds of blessings have come out for us. and

13
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,740
And I wanted to say it was a little bit symbolic Shri Mataji when you came here this house was in complete degradation and ruin

14
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,140
and now you have built it up and reconstructed it, renovated it, into the palace that it is.

15
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:37,320
And we hope  Shri Mataji you can achieve the same marvellous transformation with us because it’s symbolic.

16
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,600
But have I not done that? I have already.

17
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,460
You see, it is your doing, your accepting is the one that has worked.

18
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,000
And I mean I must say there are so many. Very happy.

19
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,960
I have no complaints about Sahaja Yogis here, they are very good. But what we should [do is] expand now,

20
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
this joy, this peace.

21
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,680
This can be done very easily if you can get hold of Sahaja Yogis, it will be very nice.

22
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,140
But, as I told you, have some picnics.

23
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,920
With the newcomers, you can have some picnics,

24
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:26,240
along the river or Serpentine or somewhere close by, where they can come easily.

25
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,780
They did this in Australia when I told them and it has…I mean of course Australia has such a big Sahaja Yoga there.

26
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,620
Then you will become collective the more you meet, ask everyone who you are, seeing more, sort of thing.

27
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,900
It will work here Mother when they get over their cynicism.

28
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,380
So much cynicism in the people.

29
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,440
Cynicism is there, I agree,

30
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,560
but that they can only get over if they get Realisation.

31
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,060
It’s a thing like that. If they get Realisation they’ll be alright.

32
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,820
So for that, first of all, what we have to do is to humble down.

33
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,400
they are Realised-souls so it’s much better to talk to them to do all these things.

34
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,800
The thing is that they are not Realised-souls, that’s the main point is.

35
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,760
When they come, now they are getting Realisation

36
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,760
And so many are coming

37
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,840
So our hopes that it will expand

38
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,440
Once they’ll get into the sea of Realisation they’ll be alright.

39
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
No problem.

40
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,640
I am sure that, if you work it out, you see, once they are Realised-souls

41
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,000
they are different people

42
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,880
and it will work out, I am sure about it.

43
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:31,960
We have to just meet them, have collective parties and things like that. They’ll enjoy.

44
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,300
I mean that cynicism was old, age-old, now finished!

45
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,760
and not in the young people, isn’t it.

46
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Not so much. Particularly the tiny ones.

47
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,700
They are seeing how can they give Realisation in the streets, the younger children just take it immediately.

48
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,880
Younger ones?

49
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,280
Yes. And teenagers, young teenagers.

50
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,280
And also, you see, once they grow in it they can spread it also.

51
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,760
Drinking is too much in this country. That's the thing one has to control

52
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,920
There’s no need to drink. I don’t understand there’s any need

53
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,260
But sort of it’s a tradition

54
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,100
children also take to all kinds of drinking.

55
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,180
I think maximum is not here perhaps. Maybe in America. But here also it’s quite a lot.

56
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,860
Once they get Realisation I think they’ll be alright. Suddenly they become aware of themselves

57
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
then they are alright, better.

58
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,760
First they must get their Realisation.

59
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,580
They are beginning to go out into the schools, the Sahaja Yogis are going into the schools, the primary schools, to teach

60
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:01,000
or to show them Kathak dancing and to sing, and so the children are getting Realisation.

61
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,040
No but the only thing is that here the parents might have an objection.

62
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,300
They don’t really talk about Sahaja Yoga directly,

63
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,060
just to get them to feel it. And it’s in the dance and the music Mother.

64
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,260
Best is to go to little grown up people.

65
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,420
It’s better to spend money on them, time on them, than on children.

66
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,000
It’s a problematic thing here. You see if someone starts, they’ll all join together and go against us.

67
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
So better be careful

68
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
It’s a very funny country you know.

69
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,220
I don’t know what to describe it.

70
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,760
Heart, heart is closed. The heart is closed,

71
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
which has to open out.

72
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
It circulates,

73
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:21,040
the ideas circulate from here, but in this matter, in spiritual matters,

74
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,400
they are very poor.

75
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,340
Like, Bush has felt it.

76
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,960
But Tony Blair I think is a Labour or what? I don’t know.

77
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,900
He’s a Catholic I think. Or is his wife a Catholic?

78
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,340
Wife may be a Catholic but so many Catholics have come to Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,440
In Italy they are all Catholics

80
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
but they don’t care!

81
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,200
We’ll try to talk to him Mother.

82
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,880
Who?

83
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Tony Blair

84
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I don’t know.

85
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,880
then give him my book to read, maybe.

86
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
He has no time.

87
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,160
He’s very busy.

88
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Busy with nonsense!

89
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,020
So many Muslims are coming to your country. We saw so many Saudis coming to this country!

90
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,360
I mean, Saudis, if they come, they are the worst Muslims!

91
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,620
So many Saudis!

92
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,920
They have money, alright, but I don’t know their plans.

93
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,800
And they look after these people who try to bring about all the problems – the Saudis.

94
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
They are the ones who supply money,

95
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
isn’t it,

96
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,240
and all those things. In India they are running these madrasas.

97
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,100
And they don’t believe in Mohammed Sahib! They don’t believe even in Koran!

98
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,120
I must say Mohammed Sahib was very great,

99
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,660
because he’s the only one who has talked about the ascent – miraj.

100
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:48,020
He’s the only one, he said that,

101
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,300
“After Realisation your hands will speak.”

102
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
He’s the only one who has said it!

103
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
None of these incarnations, nobody, has said this.

104
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,460
He said something ... The Koran also, I don’t know if it is written by him, because the language is very harsh.

105
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
But the main essence is there.

106
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,520
Language is very harsh. I mean if you read it you would think that, “How could he say such things?” Because after all he was a great incarnation.

107
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,380
but he

108
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,980
didn’t say all this. It was really re-written by those people who were very cruel.

109
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,300
But the thought, the contents, are correct.

110
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Also he did not know how to write.

111
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,420
But he was such a great prophet I think. He was such a great man.

112
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:11,980
Muslims can never understand him because he is beyond their conception. Can never understand him.

113
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,620
Even the Christians have not understood Christ.

114
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,799
They have made such a mess out of his life.

115
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,849
I don’t know how human beings do that.

116
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,679
Anybody who is great, who is something sensible, if he says anything, you make a mess of that.

117
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,490
That’s human behaviour.

118
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,250
But he said, “I’m not a prophet. I am nothing.” That’s what he said. I also said the same thing in the beginning.

119
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,520
Because if they know somebody is saying that they will kill him.

120
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,340
It’s very

121
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,260
difficult.

122
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,940
In the beginning Sahaja Yoga was very difficult, but now it’s better.

123
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,879
But still in your country they have horrible people;

124
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,600
they are all those horrible Swiss, they have come here

125
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,720
working it out.

126
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,200
Even they went into our bank to find out the money and everything.

127
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:50,800
I don’t know why the media here is so fond of them because they give something funny about Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,180
But Saudis coming here is very dangerous.

129
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
They are settling down in London,

130
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
specially in London

131
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,659
It’s very dangerous, because they are moneyed people and they don’t believe in

132
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,528
The Prophet or anything.

133
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
They have their own

134
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
thinking

135
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
How will it

136
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
be useful?

137
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,060
But how they are given visas – is the best part.

138
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:52,760
Jai Shri Mataji. If you have money then it’s very easy to come to this country.

139
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,020
Because they said this house is sold out. I said, “I hope not to a Saudi?”

140
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,940
Because they are buying everywhere.

141
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,740
I think it would be difficult for a Saudi to live here!

142
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,560
So we have to try it. And I think you will get more people now.

143
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,980
Younger people of course you will get

144
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,760
because they have no way to work it out.
