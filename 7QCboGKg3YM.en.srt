1
00:00:11,723 --> 00:00:16,643
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

2
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:21,251
Spirit that resides in your heart.

3
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:27,745
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

4
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:32,402
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

5
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:42,837
Spirit is the one which is the diamond which shines

6
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:47,890
on this beautiful ring of your body, mind and your emotions.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,977
That’s the most important thing.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,082
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

9
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:03,825
That state should be achieved by all of you.

10
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:08,683
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

11
00:01:08,763 --> 00:01:16,097
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

12
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:21,685
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

13
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:25,535
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

14
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:30,097
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

15
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,240
I mean, I have to control myself;

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,914
the love just shoots off from the being

17
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:40,369
and just I want to give it

18
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:46,027
but I wonder whether you’ll be able to bear it,

19
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:51,370
so I have to control it a little bit

20
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,317
that flood may not be borne.

21
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:59,692
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

22
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:02,095
And the more you enrich it,

23
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:07,185
the more you make it strong, the more it will shine.

24
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:12,780
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand

25
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,717
that Spirit is love,

26
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:21,452
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

27
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:24,766
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

28
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:29,529
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

29
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:37,141
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

30
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:41,348
the inside starts shining by itself.

31
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:46,985
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

32
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:53,700
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving 
to the Spirit, you can’t imagine.

33
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,195
Try them! You will enjoy yourself.

34
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,232
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

35
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,560
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,327
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

37
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,259
because I can enjoy myself there better!

38
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:13,245
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself so much

39
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,602
when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

40
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:21,623
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

41
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,887
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

42
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:30,288
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

43
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:34,040
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,377
Sometimes you come down, you start criticizing others.

45
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,331
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees somebody

46
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:44,456
filthy, dirty, something like that.

47
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,563
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

48
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,075
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

49
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:52,521
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

50
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,609
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

51
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,995
But instead of that if you start criticizing that person,

52
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:02,582
you also become filthy in your language, 
filthy in your mind and everything,

53
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:06,144
so why [do it]? Leave it! Let that person improve by himself,

54
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:11,151
to see that he has to be clean, he has 
to be neat, he has to be sensible.

55
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,768
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

56
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:17,934
Where is your attention?

57
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:23,483
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will 
ask the children when they are standing,

58
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,368
“Where is your attention?”  “Where is my attention?” alright.

59
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,216
Then again he’s standing there, “Where is your attention?”

60
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:33,394
Again he’ll be on the watch [out], “Where is my attention gone?”

61
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,017
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

62
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:40,003
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

63
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:47,189
I hope this time we are going to achieve a lot because

64
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,142
I have a feeling that this time, in all the pujas,

65
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,799
I am really working very, very hard — very hard.

66
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,016
And if you people little bit, little bit decide

67
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:04,642
that we are not here for enjoyment, for 
buying clothes or saris or anything,

68
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,546
but we are here for our ascent.

69
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:13,509
If that is decided in your hearts, I’m sure it will work out.

70
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,432
Please try to control your attention.

71
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,243
Control it. Chitta niroda. Control it.

72
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:23,563
Where is it going? See, “Where is my attention going?

73
00:05:23,854 --> 00:05:25,843
Ask, “Where is the attention going?”

74
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:29,115
Ask yourself, “Am I there or am I out?”

75
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:34,111
Otherwise you’ll have very funny awareness,

76
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,183
very funny awareness.

77
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:43,790
But the most thing is, that in your heart, in your mind,

78
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,352
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.

79
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,435
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

80
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:53,259
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is not good, 
that man is not good.’

81
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,338
Just don’t listen to these things, just listen to yourself,

82
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,472
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’ 
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

83
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,926
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I helping others?’

84
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:09,665
‘Where is my attention?’ The attention has to be:

85
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,724
‘What am I doing with what Mother has given to me?’

86
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:18,233
Now at Vishuddhi as you know we are collective

87
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,677
and we have connections with others.

88
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:23,816
So He said all this is a ‘leela’ [play]

89
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:30,743
and in a very playful, mirthful way you should be with others

90
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:35,702
and great friendly with others and create relationships.

91
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:39,099
So this is the Vishuddhi chakra.

92
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:45,733
But the other point I tried to say that the relation with others,

93
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:50,050
anything if it does not have depth, it is superficial,

94
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,959
if it is for ego or for some conditioning 
or some calculations of the mind.

95
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,696
If at a mental level if you are friendly with anyone

96
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:03,168
or for emotional level if you are friendly with anyone,

97
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,487
without any depth in yourself,

98
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:11,275
it can be very temporary and will have no effect whatsoever.

99
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:14,296
So you have to have depth and to get to the depth,

100
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,175
you must look after your Agnya chakra.

101
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:20,770
And the Agnya chakra is nothing but your attention.

102
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:29,300
If your attention is all the time roaming 
about paying attention to 1001 thing,

103
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,920
then you cannot develop that concentrated penetration

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,500
of your attention into things and whatever you do is very superficial.

105
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,435
It’s not joy giving.

106
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:48,965
So the combination should be that you should look after your Vishuddhi

107
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:53,452
– of today for example you can have a very 
playful, mirthful time together.

108
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,691
Enjoy with each other;

109
00:07:55,945 --> 00:08:01,437
but you have to know that it has to come from your heart

110
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:04,202
or from your Spirit.

111
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:06,155
So how to touch that?

112
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,975
That depth can only be possible if your attention is on the Spirit

113
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,662
and not on frivolous things.

114
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:18,560
Because of that you’ll become thoughtlessly 
aware when you’ll be enjoying.

115
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,373
And that whatever you’ll do it will be very genuine,

116
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:27,843
it will not have artificiality.

117
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:31,911
That is why the second part is after ‘leela’;

118
00:08:31,997 --> 00:08:34,246
what you call is the ‘jana’ part

119
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:37,573
where it is the collectivity.

120
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:43,333
Higher chakra is Agnya where it is ‘tapah’ – means penance.

121
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:45,059
You have to go through the penance.

122
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,101
And now in Sahaja Yoga penance is not food,

123
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,775
is not other useless things

124
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:54,477
but what is the most important is to control your attention.

125
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,216
Where does it go?

126
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,933
Does it go to your worries, to your troubles,

127
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,697
to your past, to this, to others?

128
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:05,263
Or does it go to your Spirit?

129
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:10,530
This is important to see that your attention is on your Spirit.

130
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:15,449
If your attention is on you Spirit, then you get that depth,

131
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,647
that genuiness in your relationship with others.
