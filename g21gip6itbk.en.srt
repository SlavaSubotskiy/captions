1
01:40:23,029 --> 01:40:29,090
I bow to all those who have found the truth

2
01:40:29,741 --> 01:40:35,296
and those who are still trying to find.

3
01:40:38,153 --> 01:40:42,766
The greatest problem of human beings is,

4
01:40:43,195 --> 01:40:47,416
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

5
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,844
They don’t know what powers they have.

6
01:40:51,122 --> 01:40:54,530
They don’t know what properties they have.

7
01:40:54,704 --> 01:40:57,956
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

8
01:40:58,630 --> 01:41:03,928
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

9
01:41:04,619 --> 01:41:08,699
If you could just peep in your heart

10
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:13,865
and start thinking about the spiritual life

11
01:41:14,019 --> 01:41:19,823
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

12
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:24,736
 treasure of powers of love,

13
01:41:24,986 --> 01:41:30,886
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

14
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:38,364
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

15
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:42,925
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

16
01:41:43,076 --> 01:41:46,953
 that they do not realize what powers they have,

17
01:41:47,072 --> 01:41:52,061
 and sometimes I find they are little shy
 to talk about Sahaja Yoga

18
01:41:52,294 --> 01:41:58,612
 or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

19
01:41:59,641 --> 01:42:06,062
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

20
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:11,411
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

21
01:42:12,483 --> 01:42:14,737
Unless and until you face others

22
01:42:14,864 --> 01:42:18,573
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

23
01:42:18,843 --> 01:42:26,313
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

24
01:42:27,028 --> 01:42:32,446
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

25
01:42:33,112 --> 01:42:39,677
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

26
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:46,437
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

27
01:42:46,597 --> 01:42:49,282
 you are cleansing yourself.

28
01:42:49,438 --> 01:42:56,849
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

29
01:42:56,983 --> 01:43:03,420
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

30
01:43:03,611 --> 01:43:11,592
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

31
01:43:12,623 --> 01:43:15,994
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

32
01:43:16,217 --> 01:43:22,072
 that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

33
01:43:23,093 --> 01:43:25,888
 they all drop out.

34
01:43:26,341 --> 01:43:29,208
But we must face ourselves.

35
01:43:30,031 --> 01:43:32,902
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

36
01:43:33,235 --> 01:43:37,193
that we can become a very great people

37
01:43:37,242 --> 01:43:40,958
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

38
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:44,242
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

39
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:47,136
It’s not the outside ambition,

40
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:52,794
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

41
01:43:53,537 --> 01:43:57,560
All of you are quite intelligent

42
01:43:57,735 --> 01:44:01,552
and are experts, I should say,

43
01:44:01,655 --> 01:44:05,280
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

44
01:44:05,509 --> 01:44:08,959
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

45
01:44:09,338 --> 01:44:12,097
Do you know about yourself

46
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:16,105
what you can do, what you are capable of?

47
01:44:16,367 --> 01:44:19,440
That’s the point where we are missing.

48
01:44:19,527 --> 01:44:22,409
All right, it is the urge within

49
01:44:22,529 --> 01:44:25,735
 because you have got your self-realization.

50
01:44:26,153 --> 01:44:33,128
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

51
01:44:33,414 --> 01:44:35,975
that you know the truth.

52
01:44:36,192 --> 01:44:41,419
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

53
01:44:41,545 --> 01:44:45,303
is to spread the truth to make

54
01:44:45,335 --> 01:44:51,386
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

55
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:55,193
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

56
01:44:55,383 --> 01:45:00,521
 they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

57
01:45:00,521 --> 01:45:03,103
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

58
01:45:03,854 --> 01:45:09,431
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

59
01:45:09,566 --> 01:45:14,227
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

60
01:45:14,457 --> 01:45:17,909
 by giving realizations to others,

61
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:21,822
by making them understand what are

62
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,259
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

63
01:45:26,335 --> 01:45:28,008
What they can achieve.

64
01:45:28,218 --> 01:45:33,243
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

65
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:38,005
But this fear that we may develop ego,

66
01:45:38,156 --> 01:45:41,805
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

67
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:44,182
You cannot.

68
01:45:44,406 --> 01:45:49,063
Because the more you will meditate,
 the more you will face yourself,

69
01:45:49,274 --> 01:45:55,207
you will know that you have so many great things within you

70
01:45:55,351 --> 01:46:01,317
 just like a storehouse of jewels.

71
01:46:02,153 --> 01:46:05,073
You must respect yourself

72
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,526
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

73
01:46:09,638 --> 01:46:12,563
Not what you want to achieve outside.

74
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:17,409
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

75
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:22,222
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

76
01:46:22,411 --> 01:46:27,978
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

77
01:46:28,336 --> 01:46:31,510
of great value system within you

78
01:46:31,684 --> 01:46:34,893
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

79
01:46:35,023 --> 01:46:39,409
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

80
01:46:39,575 --> 01:46:44,339
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

81
01:46:45,735 --> 01:46:49,067
But as it is I find,

82
01:46:49,417 --> 01:46:52,513
 the people are either money oriented

83
01:46:52,648 --> 01:46:56,576
or power oriented outside.

84
01:46:57,503 --> 01:46:58,612
Not inside.

85
01:46:58,764 --> 01:47:03,238
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

86
01:47:03,421 --> 01:47:07,691
 inside everything that you can think of.

87
01:47:08,085 --> 01:47:13,006
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

88
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:16,662
Now, they have become great speakers.

89
01:47:16,868 --> 01:47:21,318
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

90
01:47:21,519 --> 01:47:27,207
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

91
01:47:27,326 --> 01:47:30,972
and that with that knowledge you change others.

92
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:34,554
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

93
01:47:34,702 --> 01:47:37,381
You have to spread out.

94
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,094
This power has been given to you

95
01:47:40,275 --> 01:47:43,943
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

96
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:46,696
and to be kind and gentle

97
01:47:46,903 --> 01:47:50,214
and talk to people in that way that they know

98
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,547
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

99
01:47:55,189 --> 01:48:00,736
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

100
01:48:00,847 --> 01:48:03,712
 but to know yourself fully,

101
01:48:03,814 --> 01:48:09,060
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

102
01:48:09,337 --> 01:48:13,898
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
 millions and millions.

103
01:48:14,135 --> 01:48:17,086
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

104
01:48:17,512 --> 01:48:20,174
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

105
01:48:20,465 --> 01:48:24,674
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

106
01:48:24,817 --> 01:48:27,682
that “there must be something in me

107
01:48:27,933 --> 01:48:30,712
 that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

108
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:33,387
and to understand the subtle system."

109
01:48:33,586 --> 01:48:35,384
It’s a very subtle system

110
01:48:35,577 --> 01:48:39,178
and it can be known only to very subtle people

111
01:48:39,281 --> 01:48:41,549
 and not to gross people.

112
01:48:41,838 --> 01:48:47,476
But if you yourself discover yourself

113
01:48:47,706 --> 01:48:51,920
 and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

114
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:53,974
because you are not ego.

115
01:48:54,512 --> 01:48:57,066
Those who have ego, as I told you,

116
01:48:57,203 --> 01:49:00,719
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

117
01:49:00,888 --> 01:49:06,891
to organize things something to promote them.

118
01:49:07,272 --> 01:49:09,785
They are on a very different level.

119
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,930
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

120
01:49:15,033 --> 01:49:18,713
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

121
01:49:19,506 --> 01:49:20,920
What am I?

122
01:49:21,193 --> 01:49:23,425
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

123
01:49:23,576 --> 01:49:26,174
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

124
01:49:26,283 --> 01:49:29,583
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

125
01:49:29,814 --> 01:49:32,644
That means you are something great.

126
01:49:32,747 --> 01:49:37,988
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

127
01:49:38,173 --> 01:49:41,866
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

128
01:49:41,993 --> 01:49:45,915
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

129
01:49:45,994 --> 01:49:48,641
But you will be an ocean of love.

130
01:49:49,483 --> 01:49:51,225
That’s what it has to be.

131
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,251
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

132
01:49:53,344 --> 01:49:56,666
I understand that these are the worst days,

133
01:49:56,753 --> 01:49:59,461
 it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

134
01:49:59,507 --> 01:50:03,654
But why are you here during this time?

135
01:50:04,137 --> 01:50:06,553
To enlighten people.

136
01:50:06,764 --> 01:50:09,320
To give them the right ideas.

137
01:50:09,467 --> 01:50:13,370
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

138
01:50:13,505 --> 01:50:16,725
 that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

139
01:50:16,951 --> 01:50:22,531
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

140
01:50:23,332 --> 01:50:29,301
He realized in very young age that he has to

141
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,939
assert on others his own value system

142
01:50:34,034 --> 01:50:36,894
 by showing his own example.

143
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:42,698
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

144
01:50:42,891 --> 01:50:47,209
still he has shown such results.

145
01:50:47,454 --> 01:50:50,325
I have read many lives of this kind.

146
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,311
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

147
01:50:53,436 --> 01:50:55,816
We had everywhere one person like that.

148
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:58,945
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

149
01:50:59,089 --> 01:51:03,472
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

150
01:51:03,607 --> 01:51:05,838
 who used to respect Me so much.

151
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,623
People would wonder why should he respect Me

152
01:51:08,758 --> 01:51:11,472
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

153
01:51:11,724 --> 01:51:14,521
 because he realized what I was.

154
01:51:14,704 --> 01:51:18,084
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

155
01:51:18,243 --> 01:51:20,141
Now, you people have a chance.

156
01:51:20,326 --> 01:51:23,286
All right, I am quite old now.

157
01:51:23,467 --> 01:51:26,879
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

158
01:51:27,196 --> 01:51:30,370
Till I live I’ll work very hard

159
01:51:30,537 --> 01:51:34,100
to convince you about your own,

160
01:51:34,933 --> 01:51:39,638
your own personality, your own self.

161
01:51:39,789 --> 01:51:42,369
That’s what I am living for.

162
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:45,437
Till you are completely convinced.

163
01:51:45,568 --> 01:51:49,172
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

164
01:51:49,252 --> 01:51:53,079
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

165
01:51:53,409 --> 01:51:55,614
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

166
01:51:55,717 --> 01:51:59,182
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

167
01:51:59,555 --> 01:52:04,994
 unless and until you find out what is your personality

168
01:52:05,248 --> 01:52:07,526
 in the real sense of the word,

169
01:52:07,876 --> 01:52:14,638
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

170
01:52:15,106 --> 01:52:17,208
Sahaja means spontaneous.

171
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:19,856
It comes spontaneously to you.

172
01:52:20,157 --> 01:52:24,433
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

173
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,583
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

174
01:52:28,853 --> 01:52:33,193
But that torsion area is there behind you,

175
01:52:33,272 --> 01:52:36,757
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

176
01:52:36,867 --> 01:52:40,171
All of you have got this, but despite that

177
01:52:40,298 --> 01:52:43,633
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

178
01:52:43,696 --> 01:52:46,692
You have that power within you.

179
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:50,361
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

180
01:52:50,603 --> 01:52:54,352
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

181
01:52:54,384 --> 01:52:56,679
I should we have lost him.

182
01:52:57,275 --> 01:53:02,282
So, one day he was going to another island

183
01:53:02,711 --> 01:53:06,988
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

184
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:14,315
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

185
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,759
So he came out and he threatened them,

186
01:53:17,902 --> 01:53:21,404
 “I am going for my Mother’s work.

187
01:53:21,638 --> 01:53:25,344
How dare you bring the rain?

188
01:53:25,509 --> 01:53:29,651
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

189
01:53:30,025 --> 01:53:31,874
And, it was surprising.

190
01:53:32,011 --> 01:53:37,069
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
 came back after five hours.

191
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,550
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

192
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:46,575
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

193
01:53:46,964 --> 01:53:48,331
It helps us.

194
01:53:48,511 --> 01:53:52,811
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

195
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:57,094
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

196
01:53:57,427 --> 01:54:01,662
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

197
01:54:01,786 --> 01:54:08,778
 but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

198
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:11,828
And that I am to be supported.

199
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:16,844
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

200
01:54:17,042 --> 01:54:21,468
that you are the people who are here to

201
01:54:21,698 --> 01:54:26,099
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

202
01:54:26,126 --> 01:54:30,372
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

203
01:54:30,475 --> 01:54:31,759
But, how can I do it?

204
01:54:31,759 --> 01:54:34,358
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

205
01:54:34,453 --> 01:54:35,985
I have to have channels.

206
01:54:36,088 --> 01:54:39,228
And, these channels who know their job,

207
01:54:39,284 --> 01:54:44,298
 they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

208
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:46,521
You are special people no doubt.

209
01:54:46,593 --> 01:54:48,853
Otherwise why are you here?

210
01:54:48,916 --> 01:54:58,398
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

211
01:54:58,588 --> 01:55:00,757
You are a wonderful conductor.

212
01:55:00,952 --> 01:55:02,553
You are an expert on that.

213
01:55:02,617 --> 01:55:04,396
It just works.

214
01:55:04,603 --> 01:55:11,497
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

215
01:55:11,902 --> 01:55:15,520
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

216
01:55:15,682 --> 01:55:20,356
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

217
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:24,769
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

218
01:55:24,817 --> 01:55:27,875
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

219
01:55:28,086 --> 01:55:30,622
I am just an ordinary housewife.

220
01:55:31,622 --> 01:55:34,382
What? It’s just My love.

221
01:55:34,587 --> 01:55:38,722
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

222
01:55:39,428 --> 01:55:43,752
 that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

223
01:55:43,975 --> 01:55:47,904
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

224
01:55:47,988 --> 01:55:51,319
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

225
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:55,143
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

226
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:59,004
The point is, I knew what I was.

227
01:55:59,157 --> 01:56:03,696
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

228
01:56:03,942 --> 01:56:06,231
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

229
01:56:06,444 --> 01:56:13,064
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

230
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:17,714
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

231
01:56:17,841 --> 01:56:22,599
 you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

232
01:56:22,774 --> 01:56:25,390
All these drop out like that.

233
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:30,609
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

234
01:56:30,874 --> 01:56:37,630
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

235
01:56:38,664 --> 01:56:41,844
And we should get concerned about that.

236
01:56:42,012 --> 01:56:45,442
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

237
01:56:45,475 --> 01:56:47,771
I went to jail, everything I did.

238
01:56:47,879 --> 01:56:53,808
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

239
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:55,366
That was different.

240
01:56:55,544 --> 01:56:58,712
But after that independence what should have happened

241
01:56:58,791 --> 01:57:03,270
is to make people realize what they are.

242
01:57:04,047 --> 01:57:08,039
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

243
01:57:08,110 --> 01:57:11,063
what is the need of that country.

244
01:57:11,245 --> 01:57:19,596
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

245
01:57:19,936 --> 01:57:24,752
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

246
01:57:24,816 --> 01:57:28,742
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

247
01:57:28,877 --> 01:57:34,763
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

248
01:57:35,264 --> 01:57:37,295
You are so empowered.

249
01:57:37,581 --> 01:57:42,573
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

250
01:57:42,646 --> 01:57:46,872
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

251
01:57:47,052 --> 01:57:50,406
But still all of you have to do it.

252
01:57:50,598 --> 01:57:55,556
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

253
01:57:55,644 --> 01:57:59,989
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

254
01:58:00,132 --> 01:58:03,567
I have not changed much because within Myself

255
01:58:03,638 --> 01:58:08,884
 I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

256
01:58:09,313 --> 01:58:12,359
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

257
01:58:12,526 --> 01:58:18,424
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

258
01:58:18,734 --> 01:58:25,650
 that nothing is important than to know what you are.

259
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:28,821
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

260
01:58:29,152 --> 01:58:30,655
Nothing matters.

261
01:58:30,792 --> 01:58:33,702
What is important is to know yourself.

262
01:58:33,933 --> 01:58:37,848
I’m surprised very little has been written

263
01:58:37,984 --> 01:58:41,348
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

264
01:58:41,554 --> 01:58:44,085
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

265
01:58:44,316 --> 01:58:49,131
 about Tao and meaning that what you are.

266
01:58:49,488 --> 01:58:52,858
Tao means what you are, and he describes

267
01:58:53,049 --> 01:58:58,509
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

268
01:58:58,715 --> 01:59:02,112
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

269
01:59:02,216 --> 01:59:05,908
 how to reach that state was not given. He only described

270
01:59:05,972 --> 01:59:10,359
 people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

271
01:59:10,462 --> 01:59:13,525
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

272
01:59:13,613 --> 01:59:17,295
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

273
01:59:17,525 --> 01:59:20,138
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

274
01:59:20,254 --> 01:59:24,523
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

275
01:59:24,763 --> 01:59:29,328
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

276
01:59:29,956 --> 01:59:32,912
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

277
01:59:32,975 --> 01:59:35,132
 he described so beautifully.

278
01:59:35,631 --> 01:59:40,000
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

279
01:59:40,222 --> 01:59:42,743
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

280
01:59:43,692 --> 01:59:47,843
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

281
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:51,363
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

282
01:59:51,553 --> 01:59:55,993
 it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

283
01:59:56,104 --> 01:59:59,631
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

284
01:59:59,835 --> 02:00:03,780
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

285
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,796
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

286
02:00:07,181 --> 02:00:09,443
 that you should be in your balance.

287
02:00:09,596 --> 02:00:12,988
Now many people say who have given up smoking

288
02:00:13,131 --> 02:00:18,039
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

289
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:20,700
That means you have lost your maryadas.

290
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:25,090
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

291
02:00:25,233 --> 02:00:28,439
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

292
02:00:28,864 --> 02:00:30,725
You must watch yourself.

293
02:00:30,843 --> 02:00:32,673
You call him, “Hello Mister.

294
02:00:32,673 --> 02:00:34,613
So now, what are you up to?”

295
02:00:34,722 --> 02:00:37,908
Then you will see how your mind is working.

296
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:41,956
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

297
02:00:42,171 --> 02:00:46,752
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

298
02:00:47,927 --> 02:00:50,394
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

299
02:00:50,593 --> 02:00:53,791
that ocean is the lowest thing.

300
02:00:54,147 --> 02:00:58,179
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

301
02:00:58,345 --> 02:01:01,752
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

302
02:01:02,134 --> 02:01:04,923
So, it keeps at the lowest.

303
02:01:05,163 --> 02:01:09,229
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

304
02:01:09,348 --> 02:01:13,846
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

305
02:01:14,203 --> 02:01:18,825
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

306
02:01:19,405 --> 02:01:22,559
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

307
02:01:22,781 --> 02:01:28,792
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

308
02:01:29,059 --> 02:01:32,730
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

309
02:01:32,895 --> 02:01:36,733
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

310
02:01:37,003 --> 02:01:41,993
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

311
02:01:42,227 --> 02:01:43,816
At the lowest point.

312
02:01:44,015 --> 02:01:47,916
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

313
02:01:48,004 --> 02:01:50,944
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

314
02:01:51,008 --> 02:01:53,558
But see that you are the lowest.

315
02:01:53,645 --> 02:01:58,793
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

316
02:01:58,928 --> 02:02:01,929
that everything will come to you.

317
02:02:02,768 --> 02:02:06,308
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

318
02:02:06,507 --> 02:02:11,179
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

319
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:14,365
that you know that you are the highest.

320
02:02:16,028 --> 02:02:18,028
You are the highest

321
02:02:18,053 --> 02:02:21,638
But you are highest because you stand at the lowest point.

322
02:02:22,764 --> 02:02:25,948
It’s true that I have tremendous love for the poor people.

323
02:02:26,756 --> 02:02:30,498
It’s true also that I have been really very much yearning to do something

324
02:02:30,531 --> 02:02:36,151
for that and that’s how we have started at least sixteen projects in India.

325
02:02:37,573 --> 02:02:44,500
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

326
02:02:44,775 --> 02:02:48,203
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

327
02:02:48,356 --> 02:02:50,766
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

328
02:02:51,235 --> 02:02:53,805
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

329
02:02:53,969 --> 02:02:56,776
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

330
02:02:57,002 --> 02:02:58,629
What is the problem there?

331
02:02:58,915 --> 02:03:02,690
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

332
02:03:02,738 --> 02:03:11,265
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

333
02:03:13,528 --> 02:03:17,937
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

334
02:03:18,421 --> 02:03:24,394
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

335
02:03:24,996 --> 02:03:30,476
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

336
02:03:30,698 --> 02:03:35,526
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

337
02:03:35,653 --> 02:03:40,013
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

338
02:03:40,926 --> 02:03:47,349
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

339
02:03:47,744 --> 02:03:48,865
And why not?

340
02:03:48,990 --> 02:03:51,971
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

341
02:03:52,348 --> 02:03:54,840
You are My children. You can do it.

342
02:03:54,989 --> 02:03:58,869
But the confidence should be there that as

343
02:03:59,092 --> 02:04:04,548
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

344
02:04:04,691 --> 02:04:08,387
 because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

345
02:04:08,602 --> 02:04:12,281
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

346
02:04:12,408 --> 02:04:15,194
which stands at the lowest point.

347
02:04:15,916 --> 02:04:17,896
In the same way, it works out.

348
02:04:18,087 --> 02:04:20,693
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

349
02:04:20,821 --> 02:04:25,975
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

350
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,339
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

351
02:04:29,466 --> 02:04:34,238
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

352
02:04:34,422 --> 02:04:39,045
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

353
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:42,143
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

354
02:04:42,309 --> 02:04:47,124
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

355
02:04:47,257 --> 02:04:50,837
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

356
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:54,373
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

357
02:04:54,548 --> 02:04:59,510
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

358
02:04:59,727 --> 02:05:03,690
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

359
02:05:03,886 --> 02:05:07,338
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

360
02:05:07,426 --> 02:05:10,195
 in case your peace is established.

361
02:05:11,086 --> 02:05:17,100
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

362
02:05:17,842 --> 02:05:23,677
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

363
02:05:23,821 --> 02:05:27,911
and findout what is lacking.

364
02:05:28,307 --> 02:05:34,386
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

365
02:05:36,455 --> 02:05:40,610
They can explode all the myths of the world.

366
02:05:40,755 --> 02:05:42,221
I know that.

367
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:47,792
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

368
02:05:47,998 --> 02:05:51,392
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

369
02:05:51,543 --> 02:05:56,046
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

370
02:05:56,236 --> 02:06:00,852
 then give Me this, that you show your confidence

371
02:06:01,027 --> 02:06:03,461
 and you work it out wherever you are.

372
02:06:03,649 --> 02:06:05,390
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

373
02:06:05,508 --> 02:06:07,111
You don’t have to change anything.

374
02:06:07,255 --> 02:06:11,571
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

375
02:06:11,651 --> 02:06:17,551
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

376
02:06:18,384 --> 02:06:22,770
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

377
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:28,040
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

378
02:06:28,183 --> 02:06:32,529
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

379
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:37,375
 subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

380
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:39,120
May God Bless you.
