1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,764
Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis of all the Yogas.

2
00:00:04,467 --> 00:00:07,571
Only thing [is] human beings have

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:10,683
 a wrong notion that they can do something about it.

4
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,795
It’s all built in them.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,037
Like any good instrument

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,110
it’s all built in and as soon as the Kundalini starts

7
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,417
She starts working it out.

8
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,918
And all these gadgets within us go into motion

9
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,287
and they create that

10
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,051
state within us by which the Kundalini rises within you.

11
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:42,951
Perhaps, we take it for granted,

12
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,319
Kundalini rising so much because

13
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:48,538
we do not see all that’s happening within.

14
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:51,527
(Talking to a mother with a child) Can you
take him out?

15
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:57,875
He’s so happy that I don’t feel [he’s]
disturbing but everybody [else] is disturbed.

16
00:00:58,702 --> 00:01:05,094
Rising of the Kundalini is the easiest for Me.

17
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:06,874
No problem.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,411
Even working out those gadgets as I called them

19
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,680
– chakras and their different movements,

20
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:20,162
constrictions and dilatation at a particular point

21
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:23,902
when Kundalini is coming up – is not difficult.

22
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,638
But there are two other channels within us,

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,162
which you know very well, which act our sympathetic nervous system.

24
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:37,374
Which can be quite in trouble

25
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,431
because of various conditionings within us.

26
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,953
For example, some people have, say,

27
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,743
a small conditioning like going to a spiritualist.

28
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:51,818
Take a position, a very simple thing like going to a spiritualist.

29
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:55,095
Now you ask the person, “Have you been to a spiritualist?”

30
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:59,468
Because if you find burning on the left Swadishthana

31
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:02,125
and the heart catching a little, it’s definitely

32
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,789
he has been to somebody like that, which is unauthorised.

33
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,300
If you do something unauthorised you can feel it on your

34
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:12,665
Swadishthana, that the person has been there.

35
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:18,251
Now see, just say that he has been there, to a spiritualist,

36
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,162
you can work it out by giving the bandhan to the spiritualist

37
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,278
whose name he might tell. Even if he doesn’t tell it can work out.

38
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:28,272
It is that subtle and it works that subtle.

39
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,956
But that much one has to say.

40
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,220
Now, the reason for all this is this:

41
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:36,414
that at this stage when you are getting Realisation,

42
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:38,364
you are human beings,

43
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,241
the highest that the Creation has created, highest.

44
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,516
And that you have the freedom to choose

45
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,739
the Good or the Bad.

46
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,563
This choice must be made by you.

47
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:55,307
If you make that willing choice,

48
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:59,602
then Kundalini is the easiest thing for Me or for anyone of you.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,926
But if there is hesitation about it, for example, a person may say,

50
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:06,060
“Oh, so what’s wrong? I went only for one day."

51
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,673
Anything like that, Kundalini goes back.

52
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:13,137
She is a sensitive thing, extremely sensitive:

53
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:17,839
any kind of refusal to Her or denial to Her She goes down.

54
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,248
And this is something if you understand that we are human beings

55
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:31,862
and we are the highest, highest in the Creation.

56
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,104
We have no self-esteem, I tell you.

57
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,728
Human beings have no self-esteem.

58
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:40,578
If they had, they would not have behaved like this.

59
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,037
The way we are torturing ourselves, torturing others,

60
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,849
I mean doing all kinds of nonsense.

61
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,043
If they had that understanding of themselves

62
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:53,717
there would have been no problem, but they do not have.

63
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:56,028
Only when it comes to Kundalini,

64
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,364
then they have all their esteem.

65
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,028
Most surprising!

66
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,429
Then they will say, “Why not?
What’s wrong?”

67
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:06,584
Anything you say that time, that’s the time they should be most

68
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,119
surrendering, that’s the time they’ll argue! It’s human nature!

69
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,209
Otherwise they will not argue,

70
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:17,531
if you ask them, “Will you come to the pub?”
“Yes, why not?”

71
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,039
They’ll never argue.

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,509
Have you heard anybody saying that?

73
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:25,623
Me even, I mean I tell you, I dare not.

74
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,500
Say, people come to My house for a party and thing,

75
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,689
My husband has to offer them drinks

76
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,352
because they won’t talk to us if you do not offer them drinks.

77
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,748
That’s the thing in England. In India I never

78
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,626
would allow anybody to even bring any bottles in the house.

79
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,001
But here they said, “English won’t talk to you

80
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,929
if you don’t have bottles in the house!

81
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,955
How can you do it, it’s not a house if there is no bottle!”

82
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:51,285
That’s the part of the culture, the base of it.

83
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,519
But I dare not say even once.

84
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,149
They will say “Why don’t you drink?

85
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,985
Is it not allowed in your religion?

86
00:04:57,086 --> 00:05:01,775
Why don’t you drink?”
But if I say, “Why do you drink?”, finished!

87
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:07,232
I have no manners.
I am most unmannerly person going round!

88
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,785
You see My point?

89
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,032
You are not supposed to say these things,

90
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,095
you are not supposed to discuss these things.

91
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,212
But if you say some sort of a dirty joke,

92
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,749
really everybody will be very happy.

93
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,628
There is nothing like indecency indecorum in those things.

94
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:26,256
But it is indecent to say something decent!

95
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,142
In the same way in Kundalini it happens

96
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:33,449
that when it comes to actual Kundalini rising,

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,987
one should be in the most humble manner, “Oh, God!”

98
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:40,536
Just see the time, the moment has come for you to get what it is.

99
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:43,509
That time they’ll be arrogantly like this, you see, sitting,

100
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:45,036
“No, it doesn’t happen to me!”

101
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:49,093
As if it’s a very great thing it’s not happening to you!
Just imagine!

102
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,973
It would be like a king sitting on a throne

103
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:56,665
and somebody is trying to put the crown on the head

104
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:00,553
and the person says, “Oh, it doesn’t fit me at all!”

105
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,223
It’s that silly, you know.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,567
But it is so.

107
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:08,234
And this is why the Kundalini,

108
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:12,089
the Kundalini doesn’t rise and She stops.

109
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:24,437
And once She is that way, little bit insulted She feels hesitant.

110
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,655
You see, like a guest who has come into your house,

111
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,240
if you put a punch on the nose,

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,272
it will take time for you to patch up the whole thing, isn’t it?

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,721
And that patching up is just so slow,

114
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:42,460
I mean people just don’t believe in patching up anything.

115
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,659
And that’s why the Kundalini is so disturbing.

116
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,992
It is so disturbing.

117
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:56,211
One should understand that She is extremely sensitive,

118
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,878
She is your self-respect.

119
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,710
Any fun you make out of Her is a waste:

120
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,059
you are wasting yourself,
you are wasting the energy of the Kundalini,

121
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,540
 you are stopping your Realisation.

122
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:21,779
It is very important to understand that She is Knowledge.

123
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,838
Whatever you have read so far is not knowledge, is Avidya.

124
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:29,085
Humility must come to you for that, very important.

125
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,121
You might have read thousands of books,

126
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,648
makes no difference to the Kundalini.
She is Knowledge.

127
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,763
That time all your knowledge will come,

128
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,601
 “Mother, I’ve read in this book this is written, that is written,”

129
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,193
Finished! [Then] your Realisation is a very difficult thing.

130
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,099
I’m here sitting down, “Oh please,

131
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,218
have your Realisation, don’t disturb Her”.

132
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,734
I’m sitting in between like a mediator, you see,

133
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,611
between Her and you, “Now, don’t disturb Her”.

134
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:00,728
Here you are, suddenly you come out with a special

135
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,915
announcement that, “I’ve read such and such book”

136
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:05,841
and that book must be from some bhoot or somebody horrible,

137
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,091
has to be.

138
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,479
And then you come out, “I’ve read that book

139
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,485
and such and such, it says so…”, finished.

140
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,449
Here we are talking of actualisation,

141
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:22,789
of gettingRealisation, not of books.

142
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:26,151
You have to forget what you have been going through.

143
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,768
You have to forget what you have been doing so far for Kundalini.

144
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:34,052
You have to forget all those things you have had

145
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,527
so far through your gurus and this and that,

146
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,950
and all other sorts of nonsense.

147
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:42,123
You have to forget all that and you have to think it’s a

148
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:45,014
very simple abode of your Mother

149
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:48,687
where you have come just to have your food.

150
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,520
Please come and be seated and have your food.

151
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:57,272
With that simplicity of heart only, the Kundalini will react.

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,628
If you are a lord of some place,

153
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,413
Kundalini will say “Alright, go and be a lord."

154
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:04,865
Kundalini is not bothered about you.

155
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,667
She knows who is arrogant, She knows who is humble,

156
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,880
She knows who wants Realisation.

157
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:13,478
She has been recording everything what you have been doing

158
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:16,063
since long, since ages, since many lives.

159
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,435
So She knows everything.

160
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,519
And if She even now finds the same thing,

161
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,571
She just refuses to rise.

162
00:09:25,518 --> 00:09:27,851
I’ve seen it’s a common experience:

163
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,564
if somebody doesn’t get Realisation,

164
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,671
he feels very proud, “Oh, I’m not mesmerised!”

165
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,187
I said, “Is it mesmerism, is it?”

166
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:41,368
If through mesmerism you could cure cancer,

167
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:44,178
then I think mesmerism is a good idea,

168
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
if it is mesmerism!

169
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:56,233
So first of all, before getting Realisation, one has to know

170
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,485
that this is what you are seeking,

171
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:02,077
this is what you have to have

172
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:06,378
and the Kundalini is the only thing that is going to transform you.

173
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,362
There’s no doubt about it.

174
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:12,901
But even when you come to that point of Kundalini,

175
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,035
people have read books on Kundalini also.

176
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,848
And everything they’ve read, already,

177
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:19,606
they have sorted out everything already!

178
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,104
So, then they ask,

179
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:27,094
“Then what about that book?
It says so…”

180
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:30,678
Now you see for yourself, why don’t you see what it is like!

181
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:33,745
But in seeing also you have to be humble.

182
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:37,723
Those people who have come to us with humility, with innocence,

183
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,075
 have got Realisation very well, and they’ve established it.

184
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:49,477
They have got it at a time, some of them, who were just dying,

185
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,428
just dying, they came to Me at the time they were in coma.

186
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,835
But they have established themselves

187
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,981
because they were true seekers.

188
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:01,674
If you have to seek the Truth, you have to be truthful also.

189
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,050
And if you are truthful you will see that this is truthful.

190
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:09,528
There is no hanky-panky in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot have.

191
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:12,932
There is no befooling or anything.

192
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:14,698
That’s not possible.

193
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,202
The Kundalini has to rise, She has to give you Realisation,

194
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,481
She has to get you alright.

195
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,772
No other certificate is needed.

196
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,611
This is the main certificate you have to have

197
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,899
– that you get your Realisation,

198
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,110
you feel your vibrations, not others.

199
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,106
Some other people can feel it.

200
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,167
The other day we had a very unique experience

201
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,133
and there was a gentleman and the Kundalini was trying to push

202
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,917
the Sahasrara and the whole Grace was flowing on him

203
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:47,242
as if like a fountain coming out of here,

204
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,169
and nothing was going into his being.

205
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:50,541
Can you imagine!

206
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:54,713
The Grace, just pouring onto that dumb fellow.

207
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,179
It was all falling on all the sides but nothing going into him!

208
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:01,825
And the fellow was very proud,

209
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:03,901
“Oh, nothing is happening to me!”you see.

210
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:05,605
I said, “Look at this man!”

211
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:09,071
The Grace has to be accepted.

212
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,546
With folded hands one has to get it. With humility.

213
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:22,185
How can we be arrogant when the Grace is coming on you?

214
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:26,385
Is it sensible, is that good manners, by any chance?

215
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,212
One has to be extremely humble.

216
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:37,458
That will show to the Kundalini that you want it,

217
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,274
that you want to have it.

218
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:48,849
At the smallest of points it has been stopped.

219
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,225
Like I would say,

220
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:56,481
if a little thing goes into the eyes, you cannot see the whole sky.

221
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:57,693
In the same way,

222
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:01,118
a very small thing, a very, very small thing

223
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,500
can stop the movement of the Kundalini.

224
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:09,748
And that small thing, if somebody says, “Ask this question.

225
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,332
Please ask and get it.

226
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,814
This is your due,” you have to just, to be humble.

227
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,694
If you cannot be humble

228
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,663
it is not going to work out.

229
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:30,181
That’s something so simple

230
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,932
but it’s difficult for people to be simple.

231
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:39,388
Seeker: The word ‘humble’ is
misunderstood in England, I think, a lot.

232
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:42,300
Does humble mean “no intellectual arrogance”?

233
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,410
No intellectual arrogance? Is a good idea, I tell you!

234
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,922
Intellectual arrogance now…

235
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,178
Can you open the windows, please?

236
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,846
Windows a little bit more.

237
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,106
That you can open.

238
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:55,133
There are so many people are here.

239
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,573
…that’s a good idea!

240
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,602
Now, let’s see intellectuals.

241
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,714
Oh, God!

242
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,411
I’ve had enough of them!

243
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:07,584
Even the name gives you heat, I tell you.

244
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,534
Now, let’s see the intellectuals, the rationality.

245
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,335
Rationality has lead us where?

246
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,987
Just think over it.

247
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:22,454
Rationality is nothing but your brain’s own imagination.

248
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,836
You can rationalise everything.

249
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,530
“What’s wrong?”

250
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,235
What’s wrong in anything?

251
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,670
People are killing their own children, “What’s wrong?

252
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:35,822
What’s wrong, tell Me? Basically, what’s wrong?”

253
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:38,909
I mean, they are their own children, they have produced it,

254
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,652
they are killing it, they can produce more, what’s wrong?

255
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:46,435
Tomorrow, you will be amazed,
there will be people coming out to say that,

256
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:50,569
“If we kill our children you have no business to say anything!”

257
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,172
People will come and fight the law

258
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:57,410
that, “If they are our children we can kill them.

259
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:58,782
We have produced them.

260
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,806
We can produce more children.
What’s wrong?”

261
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,126
You see, rationality can give all kinds of absurd ideas.

262
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,516
But it is not wisdom.

263
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:15,361
It is not wisdom, it’s not logical.

264
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:21,437
Everything has to be logical.

265
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,908
Sahaja Yoga is Absolute logic.

266
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,227
Rationality is limited, but logic is not.

267
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:38,319
When you sit down with the logic you can see

268
00:15:38,557 --> 00:15:42,205
that you have given birth to a child, he has a right to live

269
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,192
and you have no right to kill – that’s the logic.

270
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:54,483
If you have right to kill then it is also rightful to kill you,

271
00:15:58,066 --> 00:16:01,012
because you are a child of somebody else,

272
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:04,027
if your father kills you, is it all right?

273
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,159
Reverse it back.

274
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,876
That is logic.

275
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:17,900
So, the so-called intellectuals, where have they reached?

276
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,298
That’s all nonsense.

277
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,355
They’ve reached at a nonsensical point.

278
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:29,114
Take any, any realm, say take politics.

279
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,052
Of course I’ve nothing to do with it because it is absurd,

280
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,720
it’s a myth for Me.

281
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,344
They are just playing with shadows.

282
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:40,464
There’s no Reality in it!

283
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:43,248
None of the politics has any Reality in it

284
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,853
which is today existing whether it is capitalism

285
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,613
or communism or anything.

286
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,885
Because they have not yet found out the Real Laws.

287
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,161
They have not yet found out the

288
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,633
Power which governs the world.

289
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:03,819
Only it is the Kingdom of God that can have some politics

290
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,043
and is the natural politics.

291
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,910
They are fighting about communism to capitalism.

292
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:14,810
What sort of capitalism we have here

293
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,146
and what sort of communism they have here?

294
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:21,842
From fire to frying pan like that.

295
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:25,516
It’s all useless, absolutely mythical.

296
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:29,991
Man has not yet achieved that state 
where he can decide about his politics.

297
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,654
After Realisation,

298
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:35,236
you know that you have powers, you become a capitalist.

299
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,809
And you have to distribute it [so] you become a communist.

300
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:40,323
You become both, you have to be a communist

301
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:42,044
and you have to be a capitalist

302
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,527
and you are very happy that you are a capitalist

303
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,586
because you can be communist.

304
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,048
If you don’t have your own powers,

305
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,507
how are you going to distribute it?

306
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:56,294
The whole priority is changed and a big difference comes in.

307
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,723
When you do not know your powers,

308
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:04,640
when you do not know that there is All-pervading Power beyond,

309
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:07,249
then what are you discussing here?

310
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:11,102
It is something like, you have no money in the bank,

311
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,183
there is no market available

312
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:16,213
and you are just discussing here what to buy!

313
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,972
So, this intellectual business is a mythical thing,

314
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,166
is nothing but a myth.

315
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,562
It’s just a myth, believe Me.

316
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,227
It is nothing but a myth.

317
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:56,889
Intelligence which is not logical is abandonment, is abandonment.

318
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:01,799
You cannot have intelligence with arrogance, you cannot have.

319
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:04,296
If you have it, it’s not intelligence.

320
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,171
Every intelligent man knows that he should not be arrogant,

321
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:12,162
if he is really truly intelligent.

322
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:17,485
Very simple logic: if you are arrogant,

323
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:20,693
others can be arrogant with you, do you like it?

324
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,915
No one likes it.

325
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:32,765
Simple, simple equations are there.

326
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:37,966
If you are intelligent you may be anything

327
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,254
– so what does it matter?

328
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,040
“You hang yourself by the nearest tree,”

329
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:45,152
that’s what people will say, if you try to be rude to them.

330
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:50,048
If you are very rich and segmented,

331
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,865
fragmented then you do not enjoy your riches with others:

332
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:59,521
what’s the use of all the riches with you?

333
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,322
Life is so logical, it’s so logical!

334
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:07,843
But I think this logic you see after Realisation better and simple,

335
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:11,391
because you start sharing, you can feel the sharing,

336
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:13,920
you can feel it others, you can feel others Vishuddhi,

337
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,494
you can feel others Nabhi and all these chakras

338
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,364
and you know we are sharing now.

339
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:19,903
So, here we are

340
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:23,514
that we know that we are not separated, we are all one.

341
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,502
But today I have to warn a little bit, all of you,

342
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:39,741
that in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who get into Realisation,

343
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:42,974
becoming angels, really.

344
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,375
It’s the boon by which you become angels, real angel...

345
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,153
But angels should not fall.

346
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:55,849
You must have heard about an angel called Lucifer who fell down

347
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,881
and he became a Satan.

348
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:05,253
And it’s very dangerous for a Sahaja Yogi

349
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,899
not to be a Sahaja Yogi after some time.

350
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:14,397
He has to take a decision that, “I’m going

351
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:19,454
to be a righteous person, a good person and a good Sahaja Yogi."

352
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:27,183
He cannot be a policeman and a thief, he cannot do it.

353
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:30,380
You think of a policeman becoming a thief, what happens?

354
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,546
He is punished doubly.

355
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:39,711
It is just like that: a policeman cannot become a thief.

356
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:45,445
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi has to rise.

357
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:49,882
If he does not, it’s a very dangerous thing

358
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,536
and I would warn you that you’ll go out of circulation.

359
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,078
You just get out of circulation

360
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:03,790
from Sahaja Yoga, absolutely out of circulation.

361
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:06,328
I think it’s hot for the baby.

362
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,790
Take the baby out for a while, alright?

363
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,890
It’s very hot.

364
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:10,982
Yes, take it.

365
00:22:11,152 --> 00:22:12,152
It’s very hot.

366
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:15,936
Please, open the doors and windows,

367
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,399
it will be a good idea.

368
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:31,619
So, one has to understand that in Sahaja Yoga you have to grow.

369
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:33,678
All of you must grow,

370
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:37,216
allow your growth to take place, do not hinder it.

371
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:41,063
The more you’ll grow the more enjoyable it will be!

372
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,016
But as we are human beings, have coming out of some sort of a

373
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,292
falsehood into the Truth,

374
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,841
Reality, we have to hold on to the Reality

375
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:54,392
much more than to the falsehood.

376
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:58,380
But still if there is clinging, please try to shed them off.

377
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:03,392
Throw them out, do not cling onto that.

378
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,757
The growth has to take place.

379
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:10,463
Now the greatest calamity of

380
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,445
our London, England, Sahaja Yogis, we should see that

381
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:15,600
– because I know Indian Sahaja Yogis as they are,

382
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:17,809
they have their own problems, but we have one,

383
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,534
and that is inertia.

384
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:21,709
Inertia is our problem.

385
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:26,260
The whole country is set up with it, the inertia.

386
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:29,911
It’s a very serious problem for Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,548
And I would tell you, I have been to Europe,

388
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,448
I’ve been to Portugal, I’ve been to

389
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:38,512
India, of course you know very well and

390
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:43,364
also Australia – inertia is maximum in England.

391
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,960
Now what is the reason?

392
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:54,186
We must go to the root of this cause.

393
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:58,493
I have told you that England is the Heart of the Universe.

394
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,153
Seeker: Must be a joke – England is the Heart of the Universe?

395
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,497
You didn’t know that?
Seeker: The Universe, is it?

396
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:10,322
Yes.
Seeker: Don’t believe you!

397
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:13,883
Shri Mataji: That’s too much ah?

398
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:48,296
Then speaking aside about changing for a bigger
room in 5 minutes.

399
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,776
Now about this heart I will tell you

400
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:54,976
downstairs, I think, if we can move down.

401
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,277
There it will be better because it’s very hot here

402
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:00,225
and there’s a food also is to be organised in that room.

403
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:02,228
So it’s better to go now.

404
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:06,618
All right?
Go and find your seats, I’ll be just there.

405
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:14,764
And you are the people who are responsible for the heart.

406
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:19,742
Now heart is the most important organ in the body.

407
00:25:20,872 --> 00:25:23,324
If the heart fails, the whole body fails.

408
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:29,120
Supposing the brain fails, still the body will go on.

409
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:36,243
But if the heart fails, the body stops functioning.

410
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,842
So the attack is on the heart.

411
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:50,279
All the satanic forces and demonic forces and destructive forces

412
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:54,446
will try to attack the heart, naturally,

413
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:59,511
because if they attack any other place

414
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,563
then the body will be still functioning.

415
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,524
So, first they will try all their methods to attack the heart.

416
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:16,366
I’m saying this because today there are at least

417
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:18,112
80% Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

418
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:21,350
that they should understand their responsibility.

419
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,554
If this heart becomes frozen through inertia,

420
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:37,721
there is no hope for the whole world and neither for the Universe

421
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:46,338
or for this Creation, there is no hope.

422
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:51,449
That’s why I’m stationed in England.

423
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:57,368
I have been travelling and travelling in England,

424
00:26:58,548 --> 00:27:00,228
spreading vibrations.

425
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,934
But I think English Sahaja Yogis do not think

426
00:27:06,694 --> 00:27:13,156
how important it is to awaken themselves and to work it out.

427
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:22,336
The movement is extremely slow as if it is deadening.

428
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:25,817
And I am sometimes really worried about it.

429
00:27:31,211 --> 00:27:35,147
We have to see now how these negative forces work in us.

430
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:42,192
They work in us in various ways.

431
00:27:47,313 --> 00:27:48,433
First of all,

432
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:55,816
they will work in us through people who are vulnerable.

433
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:09,821
We have people among us who are weak Sahaja Yogis.

434
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:17,691
Who cannot sustain the Truth within themselves

435
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:25,229
and they are very vulnerable for all these negative forces.

436
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:35,173
These negative forces work through them.

437
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:47,750
They give you ideas as a very highly developed centre.

438
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:55,196
There were some Sahaja Yogis who are really first class,

439
00:28:56,999 --> 00:29:00,519
they were given idea by one of the such vulnerable one

440
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:04,599
that, “Why should we combine with others who are not so good?

441
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:07,196
Let’s have a separate entity."

442
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,554
Because, before this,

443
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:12,559
one person used to get very important and he used to organise,

444
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:15,516
“Do this!” and “Do that!” and used to boast.

445
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,675
Because I stopped all that, they

446
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:23,281
– these people who were really good and sensible people,

447
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:25,182
they were given this idea that,

448
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:26,997
“Let’s start our organisation separately”.

449
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:30,455
I mean, in the sense that, “Let’s have a deeper

450
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:34,488
meditation” or some sort of a thing.

451
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:41,259
To a simple person it would look really good

452
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,822
because those who are good should really go further,

453
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:47,405
why should they be, sort of, tied with others.

454
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,231
But one has to know that you cannot be segmented.

455
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,330
If this finger is sick it is more
necessary to look after that sick finger.

456
00:30:02,432 --> 00:30:03,640
I do that way.

457
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,812
If I look after someone much more,

458
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:11,132
then know that person needs My help, that’s why. To a point.

459
00:30:13,284 --> 00:30:16,263
But sometimes such people can come out to say that,

460
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:17,885
“Oh, Mother cares for me so much.

461
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,410
She has said this, She said that!”

462
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:21,356
All sorts of nonsense can work out.

463
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:24,645
It depends on your wisdom to understand.

464
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:35,924
Now, when these people said that they would like to have a another

465
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:41,241
organisation or, say, another deeper meditation thing.

466
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,382
I said, “You have not even followed the basics of Sahaja Yoga

467
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,093
though you have gone so high up.

468
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,318
How is it?”

469
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:56,425
Everyone is a part of One Whole

470
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:03,375
and we have to articulate through them this Divine life.

471
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:09,942
Nobody is to be condemned or discredited and put down.

472
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,210
Everyone is important.

473
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,117
If somebody is so sick that he should be taken out,

474
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,349
he goes out of circulation automatically.

475
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,108
It is managed that way.

476
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:24,015
You have seen so many people have gone out of circulation.

477
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,858
Then it is their lookout.

478
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,809
But you don’t worry about these things,

479
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:34,538
you have to only worry how much one you are one with others.

480
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:38,084
If one person says, “I am higher than others!” then

481
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:41,201
know that his fall is imminent.

482
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:54,482
This kind of domination is absolutely not allowed

483
00:31:55,276 --> 00:32:01,851
and such a person falls, you have seen, this happens.

484
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:11,533
So, no fragmentation is to be thought of.

485
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,729
Everybody has to grow in a tree.

486
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,417
Every bit is important.

487
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,013
In a body every part is important.

488
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:31,576
Even if there is a slightest pain in one of the fingers,

489
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:33,678
the whole body looks after it.

490
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:38,775
Does it cut out the finger because it is painful?

491
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,040
Or does anything in the body think that that is so important?

492
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,058
Even heart?

493
00:32:49,744 --> 00:32:54,095
That feeling itself is taking you away from the whole.

494
00:32:55,501 --> 00:33:00,592
Try to find your wholesomeness among your brothers and sisters,

495
00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:03,336
try to patch up.

496
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:06,741
Love each other.

497
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,485
Love each other.

498
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:12,623
Now, no question of My saying as yourself,

499
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:16,287
because you can feel it, that they all exist within you.

500
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,667
So that question doesn’t arise.

501
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:24,569
But those who try to exclude themselves

502
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,426
and keep to themselves

503
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,866
and just don’t bother about others, are not going to grow.

504
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:35,211
Neither those who try to dominate others

505
00:33:35,302 --> 00:33:38,502
and try to sit on their heads and try to show off

506
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,814
– they are going to fall.

507
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:45,763
Why I’m saying this?

508
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:50,683
Because England is very important to Me

509
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:57,166
and this is a very common failing among us.

510
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,527
When I’m talking to you, I’m talking as British, Myself.

511
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,889
All those who are also here,

512
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,233
Indians or whatsoever, they are all British

513
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,825
and they all develop these qualities.

514
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:20,566
So, no kind of aggressiveness will be permitted in Sahaja Yoga.

515
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:24,070
Such a person will have to go out of circulation.

516
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,172
One has to be very careful.

517
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,741
The another very big problem of inertia is

518
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:46,555
that people say, “Now Sahaja Yoga will do everything."

519
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:49,922
Where is Sahaja Yoga? It exists within you.

520
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:54,355
It’s in your own Kundalini, in your own hands, in your own feet.

521
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,960
Before Realisation effortlessness is alright.

522
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:00,907
After Realisation you have to be dynamic.

523
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:04,748
For example, when you have to enlighten the light,

524
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,690
the light doesn’t move here and there, 
otherwise you cannot enlighten it.

525
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:11,416
But after enlightenment, it has to give light,

526
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,409
otherwise what’s the use of enlightening it?

527
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:22,025
So, everybody has to start moving about

528
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:27,521
and trying to work out Sahaja Yoga everywhere, every place,

529
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,458
every person that you can.

530
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:34,989
Talk to them in a way that they feel convinced

531
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:36,991
that you are sensible people.

532
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:40,806
The other day I was telling them that:

533
00:35:41,203 --> 00:35:44,692
I do not say that you should dress up in a way that is aggressive,

534
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:47,931
but also not dress up in a way that is repulsive.

535
00:35:50,267 --> 00:35:53,767
Right from dressing up you go further,

536
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,159
the way you talk to people.

537
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,366
Then go deeper into it.

538
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:02,294
It’s very easy for anybody to make
out whether you are genuine or not.

539
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:05,043
And the most important is how far you have

540
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:08,899
achieved in Sahaja Yoga is the point they are going to see.

541
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,478
Not Me, they are going to see you.

542
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,657
We all have to spread Sahaja Yoga, it is very important.

543
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:26,487
And England is very important, much more than Europe or India.

544
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:35,907
And that’s why I hope you all will understand your responsibility.

545
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,925
First and foremost is to be humble, try to be humble.

546
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:46,677
Humble because so far you have not known

547
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,078
what is the Truth or the Reality is.

548
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:53,651
To know it you have to be humble,

549
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,402
because it doesn’t come to you out of arrogance.

550
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,236
It comes through,

551
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,258
it penetrates in you, it sieves through you if you are humble,

552
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,753
otherwise it does not.

553
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:07,241
I am warning you!

554
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:08,631
It does not.

555
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:10,631
It doesn’t go to arrogant people

556
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:14,041
and to aggressive people, it doesn’t work out in them,

557
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,711
it only works out among humble people.

558
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:24,045
Try to be humble in your heart.

559
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:26,653
We enjoy your humility.

560
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:29,293
You really enjoy your humility.

561
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,891
Actually humility gives you innocence.

562
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,368
Humility is the only way to achieve our lost innocence.

563
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:40,811
Even if you have all the powers of the world

564
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:43,803
and you are humble, how beautiful you look!

565
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:51,331
Any person who is in a big position and if he is humble,

566
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:55,979
people write legends after such a personality.

567
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:06,027
Try to develop a humble attitude towards life, extremely humble.

568
00:38:06,656 --> 00:38:11,424
But with humility we confuse inertia, that’s a wrong thing.

569
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:16,329
Humility never means inertia, humility means dynamism.

570
00:38:22,304 --> 00:38:26,632
And that dynamism is extremely quiet, silent and beautiful.

571
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,727
Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous thing, it’s Mahayoga.

572
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:36,969
At this stage it is Mahayoga,

573
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:41,663
because it has reached it’s highest peak now.

574
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:48,694
Never in any incarnation so many realisations were given.

575
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,152
Krishna used to do Sahaja Yog,

576
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:54,565
He used to raise Kundalini, Rama did that,

577
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:59,951
Christ did it, Buddha did it, Mahavira did it.

578
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,740
Nobody could achieve mass realisation.

579
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:09,594
Today it’s so fortunate that I am facing so many saints.

580
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,134
It’s My great faith and great fortune

581
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:19,003
that you all have got Realisation.

582
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:24,430
You don’t know, My joy has no words to express itself.

583
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:29,744
But let not this garden be ruined

584
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,778
by abandonment and by foolishness.

585
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:39,807
It is tender, newly blossoming, beautiful garden.

586
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:43,277
Look after it with that care and gentleness.

587
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,379
Otherwise it can all fritter away.

588
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:58,548
Most of the fake gurus are being exposed now.

589
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,816
They are all going to be exposed.

590
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:03,966
They’ll fritter away because they are false.

591
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:07,382
But if Sahaja Yoga fritters away, you English

592
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:09,831
Sahaja Yogis will be held responsible

593
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,387
because of your inertia or your arrogance.

594
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:14,475
When you are active you are arrogant,

595
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,511
when you are not you are lethargic.

596
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:23,636
Please, come out of these two extremes.

597
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:29,936
I request you to meditate on this about yourself

598
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:35,094
and I’m sure we are going to achieve wonders,

599
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:38,766
definitely, no doubt about it.

600
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,331
May God bless you all

601
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:49,871
Those who have come for the first time,

602
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:52,026
I would request them to come in front

603
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:54,640
so that we can see them, all of them.
