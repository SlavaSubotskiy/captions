1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,920
Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis of all the Yogas.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:10,950
Only thing [is] human beings have a wrong
notion that they can do something about it.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,540
It’s all built in them.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,480
Like any good instrument it’s all built
in and as soon as the Kundalini starts She

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,689
starts working it out.

6
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:32,619
And all these gadgets within us go into motion
and they create that state within us by which

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:37,400
the Kundalini rises within you.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:48,510
Perhaps, we take it for granted, Kundalini
rising so much because we do not see all that’s

9
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,660
happening within.

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,580
(Talking to a mother with a child) Can you
take him out?

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,150
He’s so happy that I don’t feel [he’s]
disturbing but everybody [else] is disturbed.

12
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,519
Rising of the Kundalini is the easiest for
Me.

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,170
No problem.

14
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:16,810
Even working out those gadgets as I called
them – chakras and their different movements,

15
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,740
constrictions and dilatation at a particular
point when Kundalini is coming up – is not

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,140
difficult.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:32,840
But there are two other channels within us,
which you know very well, which act our sympathetic

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,249
nervous system.

19
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:41,719
Which can be quite in trouble because of various
conditionings within us.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:49,289
For example, some people have, say, a small
conditioning like going to a spiritualist.

21
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:54,649
Take a position, a very simple thing like
going to a spiritualist.

22
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:55,689
Now you ask the person, “Have you been to
a spiritualist?”

23
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:02,319
Because if you find burning on the left Swadishthana
and the heart catching a little, it’s definitely

24
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,789
he has been to somebody like that, which is
unauthorised.

25
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:11,500
If you do something unauthorised you can feel
it on your Swadishthana, that the person has

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
been there.

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,740
Now see, just say that he has been there,
to a spiritualist, you can work it out by

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,340
giving the bandhan to the spiritualist whose
name he might tell.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,430
Even if he doesn’t tell it can work out.

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,980
It is that subtle and it works that subtle.

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,490
But that much one has to say.

32
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,780
Now, the reason for all this is this: that
at this stage when you are getting Realisation,

33
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,720
you are human beings, the highest that the
Creation has created, highest.

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,900
And that you have the freedom to choose the
Good or the Bad.

35
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,810
This choice must be made by you.

36
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,260
If you make that willing choice, then Kundalini
is the easiest thing for Me or for anyone

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,880
of you.

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,320
But if there is hesitation about it, for example,
a person may say, “Oh, so what’s wrong?

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,540
I went only for one day."

40
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,250
Anything like that, Kundalini goes back.

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:18,010
She is a sensitive thing, extremely sensitive:
any kind of refusal to Her or denial to Her

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,990
She goes down.

43
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:29,370
And this is something if you understand that
we are human beings and we are the highest,

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,210
highest in the Creation.

45
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,560
We have no self-esteem, I tell you.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,900
Human beings have no self-esteem.

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,750
If they had, they would not have behaved like
this.

48
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:48,030
The way we are torturing ourselves, torturing
others, I mean doing all kinds of nonsense.

49
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,390
If they had that understanding of themselves
there would have been no problem, but they

50
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,390
do not have.

51
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,160
Only when it comes to Kundalini, then they
have all their esteem.

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
Most surprising!

53
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,950
Then they will say, “Why not?

54
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,150
What’s wrong?”

55
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,910
Anything you say that time, that’s the time
they should be most surrendering, that’s

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,910
the time they’ll argue!

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,910
It’s human nature!

58
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:16,519
Otherwise they will not argue, if you ask
them, “Will you come to the pub?”

59
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,980
“Yes, why not?”

60
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,440
They’ll never argue.

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,690
Have you heard anybody saying that?

62
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,170
Me even, I mean I tell you, I dare not.

63
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,610
Say, people come to My house for a party and
thing, My husband has to offer them drinks

64
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,040
because they won’t talk to us if you do
not offer them drinks.

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
That’s the thing in England.

66
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,020
In India I never would allow anybody to even
bring any bottles in the house.

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,930
But here they said, “English won’t talk
to you if you don’t have bottles in the

68
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,930
house!

69
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,510
How can you do it, it’s not a house if there
is no bottle!”

70
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,650
That’s the part of the culture, the base
of it.

71
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,170
But I dare not say even once.

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,230
They will say “Why don’t you drink?

73
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,410
Is it not allowed in your religion?

74
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,670
Why don’t you drink?”

75
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,750
But if I say, “Why do you drink?”, finished!

76
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,750
I have no manners.

77
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,750
(Laughter) I am most unmannerly person going
round!

78
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,750
You see My point?

79
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:13,370
You are not supposed to say these things,
you are not supposed to discuss these things.

80
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,150
But if you say some sort of a dirty joke,
really everybody will be very happy.

81
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,360
There is nothing like indecency indecorum
in those things.

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,320
But it is indecent to say something decent!

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,770
In the same way in Kundalini it happens that
when it comes to actual Kundalini rising,

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,910
one should be in the most humble manner, “Oh,
God!”

85
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,870
Just see the time, the moment has come for
you to get what it is.

86
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,541
That time they’ll be arrogantly like this,
you see, sitting, “No, it doesn’t happen

87
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,541
to me!”

88
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,740
As if it’s a very great thing it’s not
happening to you!

89
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Just imagine!

90
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,220
It would be like a king sitting on a throne
and somebody is trying to put the crown on

91
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,480
the head and the person says, “Oh, it doesn’t
fit me at all!”

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,460
It’s that silly, you know.

93
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,490
But it is so.

94
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:13,000
And this is why the Kundalini, the Kundalini
doesn’t rise and She stops.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:24,790
And once She is that way, little bit insulted
She feels hesitant.

96
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,390
You see, like a guest who has come into your
house, if you put a punch on the nose, it

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:36,820
will take time for you to patch up the whole
thing, isn’t it?

98
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,890
And that patching up is just so slow, I mean
people just don’t believe in patching up

99
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,890
anything.

100
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,430
And that’s why the Kundalini is so disturbing.

101
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,280
It is so disturbing.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:07:01,699
One should understand that She is extremely
sensitive, She is your self-respect.

103
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:09,550
Any fun you make out of Her is a waste: you
are wasting yourself, you are wasting the

104
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:18,040
energy of the Kundalini, you are stopping
your Realisation.

105
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,350
It is very important to understand that She
is Knowledge.

106
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,419
Whatever you have read so far is not knowledge,
is Avidya.

107
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,210
Humility must come to you for that, very important.

108
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,090
You might have read thousands of books, makes
no difference to the Kundalini.

109
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,729
She is Knowledge.

110
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,900
That time all your knowledge will come, “Mother,
I’ve read in this book this is written,

111
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,020
that is written,” Finished!

112
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,770
[Then] your Realisation is a very difficult
thing.

113
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,310
I’m here sitting down, “Oh please, have
your Realisation, don’t disturb Her”.

114
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,070
I’m sitting in between like a mediator,
you see, between Her and you, “Now, don’t

115
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,070
disturb Her”.

116
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,240
Here you are, suddenly you come out with a
special announcement that, “I’ve read

117
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,370
such and such book” and that book must be
from some bhoot or somebody horrible, has

118
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,380
to be.

119
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,870
And then you come out, “I’ve read that
book and such and such, it says so…”,

120
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,979
finished.

121
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:23,840
Here we are talking of actualisation, of getting
Realisation, not of books.

122
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,380
You have to forget what you have been going
through.

123
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,009
You have to forget what you have been doing
so far for Kundalini.

124
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:36,890
You have to forget all those things you have
had so far through your gurus and this and

125
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,310
that, and all other sorts of nonsense.

126
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,630
You have to forget all that and you have to
think it’s a very simple abode of your Mother

127
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,110
where you have come just to have your food.

128
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,160
Please come and be seated and have your food.

129
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,670
With that simplicity of heart only, the Kundalini
will react.

130
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,540
If you are a lord of some place, Kundalini
will say “Alright, go and be a lord."

131
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,360
Kundalini is not bothered about you.

132
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,510
She knows who is arrogant, She knows who is
humble, She knows who wants Realisation.

133
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,170
She has been recording everything what you
have been doing since long, since ages, since

134
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,540
many lives.

135
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
So She knows everything.

136
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,890
And if She even now finds the same thing,
She just refuses to rise.

137
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,890
I’ve seen it’s a common experience: if
somebody doesn’t get Realisation, he feels

138
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,230
very proud, “Oh, I’m not mesmerised!”

139
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,290
I said, “Is it mesmerism, is it?”

140
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:48,839
If through mesmerism you could cure cancer,
then I think mesmerism is a good idea, if

141
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,279
it is mesmerism! (laughing)

142
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,779
So first of all, before getting Realisation,
one has to know that this is what you are

143
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:05,450
seeking, this is what you have to have and
the Kundalini is the only thing that is going

144
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,480
to transform you.

145
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,820
There’s no doubt about it.

146
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:15,150
But even when you come to that point of Kundalini,
people have read books on Kundalini also.

147
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,740
And everything they’ve read, already, they
have sorted out everything already!

148
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,660
So, then they ask, “Then what about that
book?

149
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
It says so…”

150
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,110
Now you see for yourself, why don’t you
see what it is like!

151
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,050
But in seeing also you have to be humble.

152
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,220
Those people who have come to us with humility,
with innocence, have got Realisation very

153
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,820
well, and they’ve established it.

154
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:48,730
They have got it at a time, some of them,
who were just dying, just dying, they came

155
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,850
to Me at the time they were in coma.

156
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,140
But they have established themselves because
they were true seekers.

157
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,320
If you have to seek the Truth, you have to
be truthful also.

158
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,050
And if you are truthful you will see that
this is truthful.

159
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,850
There is no hanky-panky in Sahaja Yoga, you
cannot have.

160
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,250
There is no befooling or anything.

161
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,259
That’s not possible.

162
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:21,980
The Kundalini has to rise, She has to give
you Realisation, She has to get you alright.

163
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,000
No other certificate is needed.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,770
This is the main certificate you have to have
– that you get your Realisation, you feel

165
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,290
your vibrations, not others.

166
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,290
Some other people can feel it.

167
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,400
The other day we had a very unique experience
and there was a gentleman and the Kundalini

168
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,830
was trying to push the Sahasrara and the whole
Grace was flowing on him as if like a fountain

169
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,530
coming out of here, and nothing was going
into his being.

170
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,110
Can you imagine!

171
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,860
The Grace, just pouring onto that dumb fellow.

172
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,600
It was all falling on all the sides but nothing
going into him!

173
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,750
And the fellow was very proud, “Oh, nothing
is happening to me!”you see.

174
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,269
I said, “Look at this man!”

175
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,240
The Grace has to be accepted.

176
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,880
With folded hands one has to get it.

177
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,410
With humility.

178
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:23,190
How can we be arrogant when the Grace is coming
on you?

179
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,970
Is it sensible, is that good manners, by any
chance?

180
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,000
One has to be extremely humble.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,100
That will show to the Kundalini that you want
it, that you want to have it.

182
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:50,050
At the smallest of points it has been stopped.

183
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:56,899
Like I would say, if a little thing goes into
the eyes, you cannot see the whole sky.

184
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:03,310
In the same way, a very small thing, a very,
very small thing can stop the movement of

185
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,190
the Kundalini.

186
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,089
And that small thing, if somebody says, “Ask
this question.

187
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,300
Please ask and get it.

188
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:21,880
This is your due,” you have to just, to
be humble.

189
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,410
If you cannot be humble it is not going to
work out.

190
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:36,750
That’s something so simple but it’s difficult
for people to be simple.

191
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:45,340
Seeker: The word ‘humble’ is misunderstood
in England, I think, a lot.

192
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,161
Does humble mean “no intellectual arrogance”?

193
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,161
Shri Mataji: No intellectual arrogance?

194
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,161
Is a good idea, I tell you!

195
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,161
Intellectual arrogance now…

196
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,161
Can you open the windows, please?

197
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:52,161
Windows a little bit more.

198
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:53,240
That you can open.

199
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,390
There are so many people are here.

200
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,120
…that’s a good idea!

201
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,850
Now, let’s see intellectuals.

202
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,850
Oh, God!

203
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,270
I’ve had enough of them!

204
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,800
(laughing) Even the name gives you heat, I
tell you.

205
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,370
Now, let’s see the intellectuals, the rationality.

206
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,630
Rationality has lead us where?

207
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,240
Just think over it.

208
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,670
Rationality is nothing but your brain’s
own imagination.

209
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,640
You can rationalise everything.

210
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,120
“What’s wrong?”

211
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,089
What’s wrong in anything?

212
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:33,149
People are killing their own children, “What’s
wrong?

213
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,829
What’s wrong, tell Me?

214
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,089
Basically, what’s wrong?”

215
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,040
I mean, they are their own children, they
have produced it, they are killing it, they

216
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,560
can produce more, what’s wrong?

217
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,740
Tomorrow, you will be amazed, there will be
people coming out to say that, “If we kill

218
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,860
our children you have no business to say anything!”

219
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:57,630
People will come and fight the law that, “If
they are our children we can kill them.

220
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,850
We have produced them.

221
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,850
We can produce more children.

222
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,959
What’s wrong?”

223
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:08,570
You see, rationality can give all kinds of
absurd ideas.

224
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,870
But it is not wisdom.

225
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,610
It is not wisdom, it’s not logical.

226
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,370
Everything has to be logical.

227
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,420
Sahaja Yoga is Absolute logic.

228
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,149
Rationality is limited, but logic is not.

229
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:40,910
When you sit down with the logic you can see
that you have given birth to a child, he has

230
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:49,579
a right to live and you have no right to kill
– that’s the logic.

231
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:59,620
If you have right to kill then it is also
rightful to kill you, because you are a child

232
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,730
of somebody else, if your father kills you,
is it all right?

233
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,660
Reverse it back.

234
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,130
That is logic.

235
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:18,880
So, the so-called intellectuals, where have
they reached?

236
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,130
That’s all nonsense.

237
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,639
They’ve reached at a nonsensical point.

238
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,960
Take any, any realm, say take politics.

239
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,760
Of course I’ve nothing to do with it because
it is absurd, it’s a myth for Me.

240
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,010
They are just playing with shadows.

241
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,260
There’s no Reality in it!

242
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,090
None of the politics has any Reality in it
which is today existing whether it is capitalism

243
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,240
or communism or anything.

244
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,260
Because they have not yet found out the Real
Laws.

245
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,300
They have not yet found out the Power which
governs the world.

246
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:07,780
Only it is the Kingdom of God that can have
some politics and is the natural politics.

247
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,100
They are fighting about communism to capitalism.

248
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,850
What sort of capitalism we have here and what
sort of communism they have here?

249
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,900
From fire to frying pan like that.

250
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,890
It’s all useless, absolutely mythical.

251
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,809
Man has not yet achieved that state where
he can decide about his politics.

252
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,110
After Realisation, you know that you have
powers, you become a capitalist.

253
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,990
And you have to distribute it [so] you become
a communist.

254
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,510
You become both, you have to be a communist
and you have to be a capitalist and you are

255
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,650
very happy that you are a capitalist because
you can be communist.

256
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,360
If you don’t have your own powers, how are
you going to distribute it?

257
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,350
The whole priority is changed and a big difference
comes in.

258
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,220
When you do not know your powers, when you
do not know that there is All-pervading Power

259
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,410
beyond, then what are you discussing here?

260
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,200
It is something like, you have no money in
the bank, there is no market available and

261
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,270
you are just discussing here what to buy!

262
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:29,270
So, this intellectual business is a mythical
thing, is nothing but a myth.

263
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,210
It’s just a myth, believe Me.

264
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,500
It is nothing but a myth.

265
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:58,510
Intelligence which is not logical is abandonment,
is abandonment.

266
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,010
You cannot have intelligence with arrogance,
you cannot have.

267
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,410
If you have it, it’s not intelligence.

268
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:12,580
Every intelligent man knows that he should
not be arrogant, if he is really truly intelligent.

269
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,920
Very simple logic: if you are arrogant, others
can be arrogant with you, do you like it?

270
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,500
No one likes it.

271
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,480
Simple, simple equations are there.

272
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,370
If you are intelligent you may be anything
– so what does it matter?

273
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,940
“You hang yourself by the nearest tree,”
that’s what people will say, if you try

274
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,650
to be rude to them.

275
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:55,530
If you are very rich and segmented, fragmented
then you do not enjoy your riches with others:

276
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,810
what’s the use of all the riches with you?

277
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,309
Life is so logical, it’s so logical!

278
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:10,000
But I think this logic you see after Realisation
better and simple, because you start sharing,

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,140
you can feel the sharing, you can feel it
others, you can feel others Vishuddhi, you

280
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,230
can feel others Nabhi and all these chakras
and you know we are sharing now.

281
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:27,240
So, here we are that we know that we are not
separated, we are all one.

282
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:38,320
But today I have to warn a little bit, all
of you, that in Sahaja Yoga, we have people

283
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,980
who get into Realisation, becoming angels,
really.

284
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,170
It’s the boon by which you become angels,
real angels.

285
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,940
But angels should not fall.

286
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:01,470
You must have heard about an angel called
Lucifer who fell down and he became a Satan.

287
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:10,360
And it’s very dangerous for a Sahaja Yogi
not to be a Sahaja Yogi after some time.

288
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,440
He has to take a decision that, “I’m going
to be a righteous person, a good person and

289
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,670
a good Sahaja Yogi."

290
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,950
He cannot be a policeman and a thief, he cannot
do it.

291
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,700
You think of a policeman becoming a thief,
what happens?

292
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,260
He is punished doubly.

293
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:40,810
It is just like that: a policeman cannot become
a thief.

294
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:48,690
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi has to rise.

295
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,740
If he does not, it’s a very dangerous thing
and I would warn you that you’ll go out

296
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
of circulation.

297
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,240
You just get out of circulation from Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely out of circulation.

298
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,690
(baby is crying a lot)

299
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,740
I think it’s hot for the baby.

300
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,980
Take the baby out for a while, alright?

301
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,980
It’s very hot.

302
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
Yes, take it.

303
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
It’s very hot.

304
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:25,669
Please, open the doors and windows, it will
be a good idea.

305
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:31,789
So, one has to understand that in Sahaja Yoga
you have to grow.

306
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:37,790
All of you must grow, allow your growth to
take place, do not hinder it.

307
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,450
The more you’ll grow the more enjoyable
it will be!

308
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,440
But as we are human beings, have coming out
of some sort of a falsehood into the Truth,

309
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,559
Reality, we have to hold on to the Reality
much more than to the falsehood.

310
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:59,000
But still if there is clinging, please try
to shed them off.

311
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,230
Throw them out, do not cling onto that.

312
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,340
The growth has to take place.

313
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:13,789
Now the greatest calamity of our London, England,
Sahaja Yogis, we should see that – because

314
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:18,110
I know Indian Sahaja Yogis as they are, they
have their own problems, but we have one,

315
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,450
and that is inertia.

316
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,220
Inertia is our problem.

317
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,550
The whole country is set up with it, the inertia.

318
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:29,420
It’s a very serious problem for Sahaja Yoga.

319
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:37,080
And I would tell you, I have been to Europe,
I’ve been to Portugal, I’ve been to India,

320
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:44,049
of course you know very well and also Australia
– inertia is maximum in England.

321
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:49,429
Now what is the reason?

322
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:54,120
We must go to the root of this cause.

323
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:03,150
I have told you that England is the Heart
of 

324
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,690
the Universe.

325
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:22,770
Seeker: Must be a joke – England is the
Heart of the Universe?

326
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,460
Shri Mataji: You didn’t know that?

327
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,590
Seeker: The Universe, is it?

328
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,070
Shri Mataji: Yes.

329
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,380
Seeker: Don’t believe you!

330
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,340
Shri Mataji: That’s too much ah?

331
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
(laughing)

332
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:51,090
Then speaking aside about changing for a bigger
room in 5 minutes.

333
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:55,000
Now about this heart I will tell you downstairs,
I think, if we can move down.

334
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,919
There it will be better because it’s very
hot here and there’s a food also is to be

335
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,650
organised in that room.

336
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,309
So it’s better to go now.

337
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,530
All right?

338
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:11,010
Go and find your seats, I’ll be just there.

339
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,340
And you are the people who are responsible
for the heart.

340
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:21,520
Now heart is the most important organ in the
body.

341
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
If the heart fails, the whole body fails.

342
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,600
Supposing the brain fails, still the body
will go on.

343
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,700
But if the heart fails, the body stops functioning.

344
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,760
So the attack is on the heart.

345
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,350
All the satanic forces and demonic forces
and destructive forces will try to attack

346
00:25:51,350 --> 00:26:06,970
the heart, naturally, because if they attack
any other place then the body will be still

347
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,970
functioning.

348
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,730
So, first they will try all their methods
to attack the heart.

349
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,510
I’m saying this because today there are
at least 80% Sahaja Yogis sitting here, that

350
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:27,260
they should understand their responsibility.

351
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:36,550
If this heart becomes frozen through inertia,
there is no hope for the whole world and neither

352
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:46,940
for the Universe or for this Creation, there
is no hope.

353
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,880
That’s why I’m stationed in England.

354
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:02,830
I have been travelling and travelling in England,
spreading vibrations.

355
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:12,070
But I think English Sahaja Yogis do not think
how important it is to awaken themselves and

356
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,400
to work it out.

357
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:23,240
The movement is extremely slow as if it is
deadening.

358
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,950
And I am sometimes really worried about it.

359
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,409
We have to see now how these negative forces
work in us.

360
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:41,580
They work in us in various ways.

361
00:27:41,580 --> 00:28:06,140
First of all, they will work in us through
people who are vulnerable.

362
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:13,310
We have people among us who are weak Sahaja
Yogis.

363
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:24,200
Who cannot sustain the Truth within themselves
and they are very vulnerable for all these

364
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,660
negative forces.

365
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,090
These negative forces work through them.

366
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:48,450
They give you ideas as a very highly developed
centre.

367
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:58,710
There were some Sahaja Yogis who are really
first class, they were given idea by one of

368
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:04,929
the such vulnerable one that, “Why should
we combine with others who are not so good?

369
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:08,049
Let’s have a separate entity."

370
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:13,400
Because, before this, one person used to get
very important and he used to organise, “Do

371
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,410
this!” and “Do that!” and used to boast.

372
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,830
Because I stopped all that, they – these
people who were really good and sensible people,

373
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,380
they were given this idea that, “Let’s
start our organisation separately”.

374
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:35,539
I mean, in the sense that, “Let’s have
a deeper meditation” or some sort of a thing.

375
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:43,289
To a simple person it would look really good
because those who are good should really go

376
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:49,150
further, why should they be, sort of, tied
with others.

377
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,940
But one has to know that you cannot be segmented.

378
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:02,720
If this finger is sick it is more necessary
to look after that sick finger.

379
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I do that way.

380
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,890
If I look after someone much more, then know
that person needs My help, that’s why.

381
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,340
To a point.

382
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,000
But sometimes such people can come out to
say that, “Oh, Mother cares for me so much.

383
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
She has said this, She said that!”

384
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,190
All sorts of nonsense can work out.

385
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:28,160
It depends on your wisdom to understand.

386
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:38,659
Now, when these people said that they would
like to have a another organisation or, say,

387
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:42,279
another deeper meditation thing.

388
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,450
I said, “You have not even followed the
basics of Sahaja Yoga though you have gone

389
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,770
so high up.

390
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,090
How is it?”

391
00:30:52,090 --> 00:31:05,930
Everyone is a part of One Whole and we have
to articulate through them this Divine life.

392
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:11,070
Nobody is to be condemned or discredited and
put down.

393
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,570
Everyone is important.

394
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,660
If somebody is so sick that he should be taken
out, he goes out of circulation automatically.

395
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,720
It is managed that way.

396
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,010
You have seen so many people have gone out
of circulation.

397
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,010
Then it is their lookout.

398
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:33,340
But you don’t worry about these things,
you have to only worry how much one you are

399
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,340
one with others.

400
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:45,279
If one person says, “I am higher than others!”
then know that his fall is imminent.

401
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:57,420
This kind of domination is absolutely not
allowed and such a person falls, you have

402
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:04,620
seen, this happens.

403
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:14,279
So, no fragmentation is to be thought of.

404
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:19,390
Everybody has to grow in a tree.

405
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,929
Every bit is important.

406
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:29,130
In a body every part is important.

407
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,740
Even if there is a slightest pain in one of
the fingers, the whole body looks after it.

408
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,020
Does it cut out the finger because it is painful?

409
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,149
Or does anything in the body think that that
is so important?

410
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:50,130
Even heart?

411
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,740
That feeling itself is taking you away from
the whole.

412
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:04,429
Try to find your wholesomeness among your
brothers and sisters, try to patch up.

413
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:07,059
Love each other.

414
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,679
Love each other.

415
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,610
Now, no question of My saying as yourself,
because you can feel it, that they all exist

416
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,020
within you.

417
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,940
So that question doesn’t arise.

418
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,890
But those who try to exclude themselves and
keep to themselves and just don’t bother

419
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,140
about others, are not going to grow.

420
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:47,779
Neither those who try to dominate others and
try to sit on their heads and try to show

421
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:49,940
off – they are going to fall.

422
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Why I’m saying this?

423
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,620
Because England is very important to Me and
this is a very common failing among us.

424
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:04,620
When I’m talking to you, I’m talking as
British, Myself.

425
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:12,700
All those who are also here, Indians or whatsoever,
they are all British and they all develop

426
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,799
these qualities.

427
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:20,619
So, no kind of aggressiveness will be permitted
in Sahaja Yoga.

428
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:30,259
Such a person will have to go out of circulation.

429
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:35,759
One has to be very careful.

430
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:46,299
The another very big problem of inertia is
that people say, “Now Sahaja Yoga will do

431
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,299
everything."

432
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:48,619
Where is Sahaja Yoga?

433
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,479
It exists within you.

434
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:56,469
It’s in your own Kundalini, in your own
hands, in your own feet.

435
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,979
Before Realisation effortlessness is alright.

436
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:01,259
After Realisation you have to be dynamic.

437
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:06,709
For example, when you have to enlighten the
light, the light doesn’t move here and there,

438
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,690
otherwise you cannot enlighten it.

439
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,910
But after enlightenment, it has to give light,
otherwise what’s the use of enlightening

440
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,329
it?

441
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:27,459
So, everybody has to start moving about and
trying to work out Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

442
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,829
every place, every person that you can.

443
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:37,930
Talk to them in a way that they feel convinced
that you are sensible people.

444
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:43,510
The other day I was telling them that: I do
not say that you should dress up in a way

445
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:50,709
that is aggressive, but also not dress up
in a way that is repulsive.

446
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:57,200
Right from dressing up you go further, the
way you talk to people.

447
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,650
Then go deeper into it.

448
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,529
It’s very easy for anybody to make out whether
you are genuine or not.

449
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:07,980
And the most important is how far you have
achieved in Sahaja Yoga is the point they

450
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,220
are going to see.

451
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,229
Not Me, they are going to see you.

452
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:21,310
We all have to spread Sahaja Yoga, it is very
important.

453
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:31,839
And England is very important, much more than
Europe or India.

454
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,380
And that’s why I hope you all will understand
your responsibility.

455
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:44,029
First and foremost is to be humble, try to
be humble.

456
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:50,540
Humble because so far you have not known what
is the Truth or the Reality is.

457
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:58,490
To know it you have to be humble, because
it doesn’t come to you out of arrogance.

458
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:04,979
It comes through, it penetrates in you, it
sieves through you if you are humble, otherwise

459
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:05,979
it does not.

460
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:06,979
I am warning you!

461
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:08,349
It does not.

462
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:13,670
It doesn’t go to arrogant people and to
aggressive people, it doesn’t work out in

463
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:21,769
them, it only works out among humble people.

464
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:25,309
Try to be humble in your heart.

465
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,809
We enjoy your humility.

466
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:30,359
You really enjoy your humility.

467
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,049
Actually humility gives you innocence.

468
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:38,729
Humility is the only way to achieve our lost
innocence.

469
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:47,559
Even if you have all the powers of the world
and you are humble, how beautiful you look!

470
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:56,380
Any person who is in a big position and if
he is humble, people write legends after such

471
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,660
a personality.

472
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:07,019
Try to develop a humble attitude towards life,
extremely humble.

473
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:13,219
But with humility we confuse inertia, that’s
a wrong thing.

474
00:38:13,219 --> 00:38:22,599
Humility never means inertia, humility means
dynamism.

475
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,650
And that dynamism is extremely quiet, silent
and beautiful.

476
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:33,710
Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous thing, it’s
Mahayoga.

477
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:44,299
At this stage it is Mahayoga, because it has
reached it’s highest peak now.

478
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:48,599
Never in any incarnation so many realisations
were given.

479
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:56,859
Krishna used to do Sahaja Yog, He used to
raise Kundalini, Rama did that, Christ did

480
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:00,799
it, Buddha did it, Mahavira did it.

481
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,069
Nobody could achieve mass realisation.

482
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:11,579
Today it’s so fortunate that I am facing
so many saints.

483
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,930
It’s My great faith and great fortune that
you all have got Realisation.

484
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,700
You don’t know, My joy has no words to express
itself.

485
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:36,479
But let not this garden be ruined by abandonment
and by foolishness.

486
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:39,469
It is tender, newly blossoming, beautiful
garden.

487
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:45,650
Look after it with that care and gentleness.

488
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:55,650
Otherwise it can all fritter away.

489
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:58,869
Most of the fake gurus are being exposed now.

490
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,470
They are all going to be exposed.

491
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,609
They’ll fritter away because they are false.

492
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:10,170
But if Sahaja Yoga fritters away, you English
Sahaja Yogis will be held responsible because

493
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,569
of your inertia or your arrogance.

494
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:18,729
When you are active you are arrogant, when
you are not you are lethargic.

495
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:24,170
Please, come out of these two extremes.

496
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:35,299
I request you to meditate on this about yourself
and I’m sure we are going to achieve wonders,

497
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,670
definitely, no doubt about it.

498
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,279
May God bless you all

499
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:51,289
Those who have come for the first time, I
would request them to come in front so that

500
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,960
we can see them, all of them.
