2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:31,830
today we are going to worship Raja

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:36,960
Lakshmi the goddess which rules the

4
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:40,170
Kings it's a very important thing today

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:46,860
to understand that something has

6
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:55,769
basically gone wrong in the working of

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:01:04,229
our political systems and why the people

8
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:09,110
have lost their sense of justice fair

9
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:13,770
play and the benevolence of the people

10
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:19,740
well I have you gone wrong that this is

11
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:27,330
being lost it is not only in India it's

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:31,950
not only in Japan or in England or any

13
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:36,450
other place where we think there is

14
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:41,520
democracy there are people in every

15
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:47,250
country who are really a very very low

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,940
level and who are trying to look after

17
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,020
the welfare of them I should say in our

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:59,370
own country

19
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:04,740
we had great kicks very good and we had

20
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:09,299
saints who really ruled the kings but

21
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:13,459
there were real gurus they were the

22
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:17,040
people who really live their life of

23
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:23,629
saints they were real Saints inside

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,629
outside and the people

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:35,840
also accepted the Kings who had

26
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:42,040
spiritual background those who respected

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:47,950
spiritually so when the Raja Lakshmi

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:50,360
Lakshmi that is the one responsible for

29
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,340
looking after the benevolence of the

30
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:58,940
people when she acts people think that

31
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,550
they have not even think they they do it

32
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:07,160
automatically that they are there for

33
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:10,660
benevolence they don't have to tell

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,780
themselves it just that they feel that

35
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,080
it is their job this is what they have

36
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:22,030
to do is to look after the people there

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,010
to be brought to better levels of life

38
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:29,420
this is what they think they don't don't

39
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,110
think like a party politics under the

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:36,860
influence of the goddess of Lakshmi

41
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:40,640
which rules the political side we can

42
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:45,380
say the kingdoms and order first thing

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,990
is generosity when this thing happens

44
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:55,790
that you get some position if somebody

45
00:03:50,990 --> 00:04:02,300
becomes leader I don't know what happens

46
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:06,790
to him it is a myth it is ego that gets

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:11,060
bad word but this ego can be easily

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:18,290
managed if you worship the Raja Lakshmi

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:21,290
she is the giver of balance firstly she

50
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:24,920
writes on the elephant

51
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:28,010
it is not easy for a lady to climb on an

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:31,400
elephant I have done it and she stood

53
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:36,289
straight with a complete balanced

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:41,520
attitude I have blessings

55
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:51,150
are tremendous the first blessing one

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:55,770
gets the environment of dignity dignity

57
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,740
of a king dignity of a cream with her

58
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:04,759
blessing first of all you get that

59
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:09,719
dignity that dignity is full of love

60
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:13,770
love wonders that personality emits

61
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:15,139
nothing but love and benevolence for us

62
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:22,020
nothing

63
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:25,409
wherever she looks in every glance she

64
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,639
blesses people she doesn't expect

65
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:33,770
anything she's a queen what can you give

66
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:37,639
to the Queen this is the highest of all

67
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:42,779
in every way what can you give it to her

68
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:45,860
so first thing is the sign is that such

69
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:51,199
a person has a personality that just

70
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:54,449
blesses me thinks of their benevolence

71
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,710
cares for each and every person or

72
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:05,939
movers then the second blessing of the

73
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:11,310
goddess is that to develop a kind of a

74
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:17,580
temperament which is very dignified but

75
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:22,199
also very humorous and understanding

76
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:27,560
what other people are like then Raja

77
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:33,270
Lakshmi is the one who stands on Dharma

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:38,330
if there is some other me then she will

79
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:42,629
not bless that person he's a kind of a

80
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:46,459
divine discretion he should have as to

81
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:46,459
whom to be kind and whom

82
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:55,209
punishing that divine discussion should

83
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:58,689
be there in a person if a king does not

84
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:04,929
have that divine discretion then he can

85
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:07,449
punish the good and he may help the bad

86
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:10,979
people but this divine discretion

87
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,959
disappears when you are self-centered

88
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,879
that's the main point is a complete

89
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,309
detachment about the power should be

90
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,169
their complete detachment

91
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:22,869
why should Raja Lakshmi care for

92
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:26,469
anything but now there are some holy

93
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:29,259
temporary person these days and that and

94
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:33,459
then they feel haha we are on top of the

95
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:36,849
earth if you are a king you are a king

96
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:40,419
so what I mean if you are an impostor

97
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:42,689
then you might feel your ego but if you

98
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:48,809
are really the king then you won't feel

99
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:54,459
if you are under the influence of the

100
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:59,259
goddess then that is the only thing you

101
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:02,559
enjoy the rest of it is that whether you

102
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:06,180
have diamonds or you have silver or you

103
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:09,969
have anything makes no difference at all

104
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:14,469
now how people misuse the scriptures

105
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:18,519
also one should see that Raja Lakshmi is

106
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:22,419
sitting on the elephant alright so they

107
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,729
should have all very big cars she's

108
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,749
sitting on the elephant because elephant

109
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:32,019
is the highest animal it's very kind

110
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:37,979
very forgiving and has such a tremendous

111
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:41,339
memory she is not sitting there - sure

112
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,819
but she's sitting there to see around

113
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:51,519
what is happening so the person will

114
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:56,559
innately a king has the blessings of the

115
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,699
Raja Lakshmi then what does she do what

116
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:04,229
does she do to such a man

117
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:06,659
what she does is first his name is

118
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:11,149
written on the hearts of the people who

119
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:19,679
me rules she writes it with her own hand

120
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:24,289
they adore they admire and they try to

121
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:28,799
imbibe his qualities within himself the

122
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:36,839
another blessing of Raja Lakshmi is that

123
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:41,809
she grants a particular type of a body

124
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,809
which has a coefficients which gives

125
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:54,809
vibrations they may not be very selfish

126
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:56,969
people to make a big advertisement about

127
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:01,559
themselves talking about themselves is

128
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:07,019
that but the way they are wherever they

129
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:10,199
are be sure so what a politician's has

130
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:18,949
to understand that he has not to make

131
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:23,689
money he does not have to have a big

132
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:29,099
show about himself he has to remember

133
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:32,549
that I am here for the fame of a good

134
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:36,869
man he should worry about the fame he

135
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:40,669
will be living after his death so what

136
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:47,339
you have to worry is about absolute

137
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:52,729
correct character so try to make

138
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:56,669
yourself such beautiful instruments of

139
00:10:52,729 --> 00:11:00,919
Raja Lakshmi that people then they will

140
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:05,249
see you they will vote for you and

141
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:08,309
tomorrow you will rule the world I do

142
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,839
not want you to get out of politics or

143
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:13,320
be attained

144
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:17,399
but you have to first get the blessings

145
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,170
of the rajalakshmi and then only you

146
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,130
should understand what's wrong with our

147
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:27,680
country what we have to do what is the

148
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:30,720
purpose why do we want to become

149
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,829
politicians put your attention from

150
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:38,329
yourself to outside so now you have to

151
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:42,570
know that if you have to really take to

152
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:46,620
politics you have to have the blessings

153
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:50,550
of Roger and for that you have to build

154
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:55,920
up yourself with that dignity that says

155
00:11:50,550 --> 00:12:00,680
I bless you from my heart that in every

156
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,680
country such people will come up

157
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:16,740
