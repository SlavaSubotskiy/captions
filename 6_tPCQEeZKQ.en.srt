1
00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:05,976
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:17,101
It's very nice to come back to Australia for the second time.

3
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:24,685
And last time I could not come to Perth.

4
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:30,976
I did not know that it was such a beautiful city,

5
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:35,894
with such beautiful, spiritual vibrations.

6
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:45,352
What Linda has talked to you or Dr. Warren has told you,

7
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:49,685
is the knowledge of the roots.

8
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:58,685
Now what we know through science or through our human senses,

9
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:05,685
is the knowledge of the tree that we see obviously before us.

10
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:12,060
But this is the knowledge of the root

11
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:17,602
and if you have to nourish

12
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,352
the plant, you have to water the roots.

13
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:27,268
No use just plucking up some flowers,

14
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:33,644
or some leaves and treating them with something artificial.

15
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:41,018
This knowledge can only be achieved,

16
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,810
if you can somehow or other go to the roots.

17
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:49,894
For example you are paying attention to Me just now.

18
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:56,852
But if I say, " Please pay attention to yourself", you cannot do it.

19
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,934
You say, "How Mother? How to do it?"

20
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,185
So something has to happen within you,

21
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:08,852
which should attract your attention inside,

22
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,644
so that you can get your attention which is outside,

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,685
in connection with the Spirit.

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,310
And the attention then can be enlightened by the Spirit.

25
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,101
So to know the knowledge of this root,

26
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:37,852
you have to become something more than a human being.

27
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:41,185
Even Darwin, who did not believe in God,

28
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:46,602
did say very clearly, that if man has come so far,

29
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:53,602
he has to go little further to explain himself.

30
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:59,852
But as he did not try the knowledge of the roots,

31
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:07,060
whatever he said, was about what he saw apparently, outside.

32
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:18,310
To become the subtle has to be something very spontaneous.

33
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:22,602
Has to be something very spontaneous.

34
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:28,060
It cannot be done by thinking or by reading.

35
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:32,602
Some people believe, that if we read, we will go to God,

36
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:36,268
or if we think about God, we'll go to God.

37
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:40,852
It's not true. If it was so,

38
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:44,727
why did Christ say that you are to be born again?

39
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,185
Why did all of them say that

40
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,310
some transformation has to take place within you?

41
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:54,477
Even Buddha has said that you have to get your Self-realisation.

42
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:59,393
Without that He would not talk about God.

43
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:05,934
So something has to happen within us to transform us.

44
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:10,727
The other idea people have, is - beg your pardon?

45
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,560
Sorry, we have to leave early.

46
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,934
All right, you come along tomorrow. All right? May God bless you.

47
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:26,769
So something has to happen within us which is spontaneous.

48
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:34,602
Because if our spiritual ascent has been

49
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:42,644
the result of a living process,

50
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:49,894
the further movement has to be living again.

51
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,810
So we have to understand first point, logically we should understand

52
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:59,310
what we should expect about Self-realisation,

53
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:02,727
that it has to be spontaneous.

54
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,060
You cannot work it out,

55
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:13,226
you cannot become.

56
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,894
You became human beings spontaneously,

57
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,644
from amoeba stage to this stage.

58
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:24,976
And if you have to become something more it has to be

59
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,644
spontaneous by the force which resides within you.

60
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:35,352
Like the force that resides in a seed,

61
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:41,226
which spontaneously becomes

62
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:48,060
germinated when it is put in the Mother Earth.

63
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:50,935
If you read a book, you cannot do it.

64
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,477
If you stand on your head, you can't do it.

65
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,060
If you jump, you do what you like, it's not going to happen.

66
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,226
You have to put it in the womb of the Mother Earth,

67
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:05,143
so that the seed should be germinated.

68
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,060
Is the capacity of the Mother Earth,

69
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:10,560
is the quality of the Mother Earth,

70
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,935
that gives that spontaneous germination to a seed.

71
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:21,518
Now every day in life we see so many living things happening,

72
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:27,644
like a flower becoming a fruit.

73
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:31,101
But we take it for granted.

74
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:36,934
We don't understand that we cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

75
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:39,894
We cannot do anything that is living.

76
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:42,727
What we can do is the dead work.

77
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:47,268
If a tree dies, all right, so we make a beautiful furniture.

78
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:51,976
Or something dead is converted into another form of dead,

79
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:56,435
which also deaden us with habits.

80
00:06:56,934 --> 00:07:00,935
So the work of the Divine

81
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:06,101
or the All Pervading Power of Love of God,

82
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,185
is living work of the living God.

83
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,352
And that power we know it exists

84
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,769
but we are not aware of it

85
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:21,934
and we cannot feel it on the central nervous system.

86
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,435
When people talk about the All Pervading Power, it's a mystery.

87
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:34,310
They talk about the Holy Ghost. This is another mystery.

88
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,477
Everything seems to be a mystery

89
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,976
before you have got your Realisation.

90
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,894
For example this instrument is made

91
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,185
and is not connected to the mains.

92
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:49,934
It's a mystery. Nobody knows what is it for,

93
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,727
what's the purpose of this instrument is.

94
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,352
But once it is put to the mains,

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,560
you start seeing how fantastic it is, how tremendous it is.

96
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:06,101
One can't believe when they say that in Sahaja Yoga

97
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,518
you receive all these powers of your own.

98
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,268
One can't believe it, because they think, "How can it be possible?"

99
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:18,810
But for your information, you are a fantastic being made by God.

100
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,769
And this is the instrument,

101
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,477
that is lying within you in a subtle form.

102
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:29,101
Now when I'm talking to you, you have to know one more thing,

103
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,185
that you should keep an open mind to listen to Me,

104
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:36,518
like a scientist does.

105
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:40,769
It's a hypothesis for you and it's truth for Me.

106
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:44,018
All right. If it is proofed to be truth for you

107
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,352
then you should go forward with it and try to understand,

108
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:57,185
how the truth is being established  logically within you.

109
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:03,268
At the very outset I've seen people have doubts about the Divine.

110
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:06,143
They start asking, "Mother how is it possible,

111
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,769
that we can get it so easily?

112
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:12,477
How one can get realisation so easily?

113
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,268
We have to cleanse it, we have to suffer, we have to do this."

114
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:24,352
Perhaps you do not know, that when we use an electric switch,

115
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:30,185
we do not think, what has gone in the history,

116
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,976
what people have suffered in the history

117
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,185
in creating that little switch.

118
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,602
It has taken ages for this switch to come up,

119
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,185
to discover the electricity, the working of it and the whole, whole

120
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:52,769
development of electrical appliances, till we got the switch.

121
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:57,435
Now we only know we have to switch on and we get the lights.

122
00:09:57,852 --> 00:10:01,185
But when I say that you don't have to do anything else,

123
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,477
you are not to suffer,

124
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:07,101
you must know somebody has suffered for you on the cross.

125
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:10,894
Somebody has done the cleansing part of it,

126
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:17,477
and you cannot cleanse yourself unless and until you are out of it.

127
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:22,934
If you have to cleanse your car, you have to get out of it.

128
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,894
That is why first of all you must get your Self-realisation,

129
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:35,477
the light of your being, the purpose of your life, the absolute.

130
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,644
She has already explained to you the chart,

131
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:43,935
that is the instrument, the subtle instrument that is within you.

132
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,226
Now here the chart is showing you all the different centers,

133
00:10:48,435 --> 00:10:55,602
but these centers are manifested also in the gross as plexuses.

134
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:59,935
We have first of all the Mooladhara chakra.

135
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:06,060
This chakra is the center which controls actually the pelvic plexus,

136
00:11:06,352 --> 00:11:09,934
through which all our excretion takes place.

137
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:13,435
It's a very important center, Mooladhara,

138
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:16,602
means the support of the root.

139
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:19,727
Is the support of the root, is the center

140
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:22,894
of the support of the root.

141
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:26,226
Is a very, very important center, because

142
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,268
this represents our innocence.

143
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:34,310
In the subtle it is the innocence in us,

144
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,185
which looks after this center.

145
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:44,226
Through our ignorance or through our naiveness,

146
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,310
we loose our innocence.

147
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:49,101
But actually innocence can never be lost,

148
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,602
only it is tarnished or covered by our stupidity maybe,

149
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,352
by our wrong doings to ourselves.

150
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,727
It exists all the time,

151
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:04,226
and when the Kundalini rises which is above that,

152
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:08,185
which is coiled up into three and a half coils,

153
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,226
this chakra becomes aware of itself.

154
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:15,727
The deity of innocence within it gets awakened

155
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:22,560
and one starts feeling the innocence within one's personality.

156
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:28,226
The Kundalini itself, this residual power of desire,

157
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,352
is placed in the triangular bone.

158
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:36,435
The triangular bone is the bone called as sacrum.

159
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,268
It's a Greek word, meaning sacred.

160
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:43,894
So the Greek knew that this

161
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,226
triangular bone contained something sacred.

162
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,226
And when I went to Greece and asked them,

163
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,060
"How is it you call it sacrum?",

164
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,393
they said, "There has been a report, Indo-Aryan report,

165
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:59,560
much before Alexander, where we came to know about this bone,

166
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,477
that it is a sacred bone and it has a special power within it."

167
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:11,018
Now this Kundalini is a power which is the pure desire,

168
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:14,060
is the power of pure desire.

169
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:17,352
While the other, if you see the blue line,

170
00:13:17,644 --> 00:13:21,310
the left side power within us,

171
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:25,934
which starts from the right at the back and goes to the left,

172
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:30,018
is the power of desire.

173
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,310
But not pure desire, because this can be made impured.

174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,810
And all other desires but the desire to be one with the Divine,

175
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:46,810
are corruptible, can be wrong, can be confusing.

176
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,226
As you know in economics it is said, that

177
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:54,310
no desire is satiable in general,

178
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,644
because you want to buy a house, you want to buy a car,

179
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:59,185
then you want to buy that and you buy another thing.

180
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,769
You are never satisfied with matter.

181
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:06,268
So this desire which is lying in the sacrum bone

182
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,644
absolutely in its pure form,

183
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:11,727
the pure desire to be one with the Divine,

184
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:17,143
is the one that gives you ultimate satisfaction and joy.

185
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:21,602
It is so spontaneous, that if people ask Me, "How You do it?",

186
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,060
is going to be difficult to explain at this level how it is done.

187
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:29,894
As you cannot explain how a seed germinates

188
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,018
and how it becomes a tree.

189
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,644
All living things cannot be explained,

190
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:39,769
only to be seen and to be felt within yourself.

191
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:45,268
I will be able to tell you tomorrow more about these centers,

192
00:14:45,477 --> 00:14:48,268
what are these centers and what are they related to you.

193
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,018
In any case I hope you have the books now and

194
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:56,518
when you go, you can take these books with you and read them at home

195
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,143
and see for yourself, if you can understand,

196
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:02,143
what's written in those books.

197
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:06,185
But here today as an introduction, I would like to tell you

198
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:09,185
certain questions all these people have in their mind.

199
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:13,518
For example there have been many fake gurus coming from India

200
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,894
and they have been enticing many people abroad.

201
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:20,226
And most of the newspaper people ask Me about them.

202
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:26,685
So I have to tell that you of course can blame these fake gurus,

203
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,644
no doubt, that they are sinister, they have been devilish,

204
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,894
they have been money oriented, I agree.

205
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,185
But also that a seeker has to use his brains

206
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,934
and must understand, what he is seeking.

207
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:43,894
If we just blind folded go to these gurus, then

208
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:48,185
what can one do about it? It's very sad, because they are so naive,

209
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:52,060
they must understand what we are seeking, what we are expecting,

210
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:55,518
and what should happen to us.

211
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Now, some people don't understand that you cannot pay for God.

212
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,602
You have not paid anything for becoming a human being.

213
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:11,268
He doesn't understand money.

214
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,101
Money is created only by human beings.

215
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:17,935
God has not created money. He doesn't understand money at all.

216
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,310
You cannot purchase God, you cannot purchase this knowledge,

217
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,518
you cannot purchase your realisation.

218
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,435
None of the things that are related with God,

219
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,769
can be purchased with money.

220
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:33,101
Anybody who tries to take money from you,

221
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,393
in the name of God, is a parasite.

222
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:40,935
Not only a parasite,

223
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:47,268
but I would say a person who is anti-God.

224
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,352
Because that is how he is maligning the name of God.

225
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:57,894
It cannot be purchased, it cannot be sold, it cannot be organised,

226
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,934
it cannot be manoeuvred.

227
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,560
We cannot have aa organisation of God.

228
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:09,268
We cannot organise Him. He is the way He is.

229
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:12,810
We cannot tell Him now, "You come along every Sunday to our church".

230
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:17,268
He won't. It is His desire, if He wants to do it

231
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,268
or if He doesn't want to do it.

232
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:25,685
The only thing that binds God is love, dedication and truthfulness.

233
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,560
If you are truthful, if you are dedicated,

234
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:30,518
then God is interested in you.

235
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:34,143
If you are not, He is not at all interested in people,

236
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:38,060
who are seeking not God but something else.

237
00:17:38,352 --> 00:17:42,934
But what is most unfortunate, that the people who are mislaid,

238
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:45,477
are all seekers of God.

239
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,810
They are all seekers of truth, they are true people,

240
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,934
they are honest, they are dedicated and they are exploited.

241
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:57,810
So again I would say, anybody who takes money in the name of God,

242
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,185
please see that, that is not God, please!

243
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:04,310
As a Mother I'm warning you, that one has to understand,

244
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,602
any saint who takes money in the name of God is

245
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,934
not a person, who is to be regarded as a divine personality,

246
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:16,185
by no chance a saint.

247
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:19,976
Now secondly, as I told you, you cannot put in an effort,

248
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:22,769
it is a spontaneous happening.

249
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,018
Now one of the arguments people have, that in such and such book,

250
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,435
X, Y, Z this is written.

251
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:33,602
In the other book so and so, this is written.

252
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:38,934
Another fellow who was such and such has said so.

253
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:43,935
It's very easy to dwell upon such sayings and on such books.

254
00:18:44,226 --> 00:18:49,185
I would request you to be here at this moment with Me,

255
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,435
to understand what I have to say.

256
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:52,894
If you bring in other people,

257
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,310
I'll have to tell you the facts about them,

258
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,852
which you may not like, which will not be palatable.

259
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,185
We'll create a controversy for nothing at all.

260
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:03,560
Because we are not here to create any controversies.

261
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,685
We are here to achieve our goal of Self-realisation

262
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,894
for our betterment.

263
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:13,894
Once you understand this, that the main interest is of the Divine

264
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,018
and that is, that you all should get your Self-realisation.

265
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:22,310
We have known that we have become human beings.

266
00:19:22,518 --> 00:19:25,727
But we have never asked a question, no scientist has asked a question:

267
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,268
Why have we become a human being?

268
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:30,810
Why are we on this earth moving

269
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:33,101
with these two legs and two feet in this fashion?

270
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,477
What is the speciality, why God has made us

271
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:41,101
in such a beautiful way, that we are called as human beings?

272
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,352
If you ask this question to yourself, you won't be able to say

273
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,352
that there is any purpose in what God has done to us.

274
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,435
But I say, there is a purpose!

275
00:19:50,644 --> 00:19:54,018
The purpose is that you have to become the instrument of God.

276
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:00,352
You have to become the carrier of His power.

277
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:05,934
When the Kundalini rises and breaks through your seventh chakra here,

278
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:09,644
then it is amazing how you feel this All Pervading Power

279
00:20:09,852 --> 00:20:13,018
as cool breeze in your hands. But that's not sufficient.

280
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:15,894
If you feel the cool breeze, supposing I give you a car

281
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,143
or any instrument and I don't tell you how to drive, it is useless.

282
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:25,602
But if you learn the complete decoding of this feeling

283
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,685
of this All Pervading Power, you can do great things,

284
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:33,310
because God has put these powers within you,

285
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:35,935
only the light has to come in.

286
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,934
Without the light as you cannot see anything properly,

287
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,727
you cannot integrate anything, correlate anything.

288
00:20:41,934 --> 00:20:45,727
In the same way, when there is no light within yourself,

289
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:52,352
you are not integrated within, nor you understand absolute things.

290
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:55,352
What you understand are relative things.

291
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,185
With our mind projection whatever we do is all relative.

292
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:03,060
That's why we are having problems about our politics,

293
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:08,934
about our economics, about our every sort of thing that we are doing.

294
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,976
Our development also has been very one-sided in the sense,

295
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,934
that our material development has taken place

296
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:19,101
without the Spirit in it.

297
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:22,685
Anything without the Spirit is something like a tree

298
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:27,393
growing, outgrowing it's size much more than the roots

299
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:32,143
and that's how sometimes we always are worried and shocked

300
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:38,185
at the destruction, that is facing us from within and without.

301
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:42,101
We see diseases like cancer and other horrible diseases,

302
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:43,810
which we cannot combat.

303
00:21:43,976 --> 00:21:49,268
We see the problems of the nations and political, economic crises,

304
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:53,602
and we don't understand how to control it on individual basis.

305
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:58,226
All these things can only be solved if you become the Spirit.

306
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:03,310
The Spirit is within you the link with the whole.

307
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:07,934
Like the microcosm, the whole, you are a part and parcel of that.

308
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:10,644
Like my finger is part and parcel of the whole.

309
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,935
Now, if there is pain in my finger, I can feel the whole.

310
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:18,226
In the same way once I become aware of My Spirit,

311
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:22,352
I can feel the whole, I become collectively conscious.

312
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,727
I do not talk about it, I do not say that

313
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:29,477
'You are now brothers and sisters', but it just happens that

314
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:33,310
on your fingertips you start feeling others, very clearly,

315
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,976
their centres, their problems, your problems

316
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:40,185
and also you know methods how to clear it out.

317
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,143
Compassion people talk of, of giving compassion,

318
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:45,769
looking after people and doing good to them.

319
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:50,143
But this compassion talks, it doesn't solve the problem.

320
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:54,393
But the compassion that flows from you, works. It works out.

321
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:58,644
It helps people in a way that they are not aware of it.

322
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:01,852
For example in India we had one Indian,

323
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,685
who got realisation in a village.

324
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:05,935
He was a farmer, he went back,

325
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:10,518
and he gave realisation to so many people, and it is unbelievable,

326
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:17,226
how he could manage such a lot of population to come to Sahaja Yoga.

327
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,602
But he told Me that certain incidents

328
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:26,018
like, 'A man came to me and he was an alcoholic,

329
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:29,352
and he came to me and he was about to beat me.

330
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,810
But I was very quiet. I just told him,

331
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:34,060
"Now don't beat me, you sit down for a while".

332
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,976
He sat down and after some time, I awakened his Kundalini.

333
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:40,852
Overnight he gave up alcohol!

334
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,727
Overnight he gave it up.

335
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:44,810
He became like a king. He said, "What?

336
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:46,685
I'm not going to drink anymore".'

337
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:52,310
It's not mental, but just he achieved his supreme thing,

338
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:59,435
the highest thing, his purpose and the whole being got glorified.

339
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:03,268
So you start feeling your own powers.

340
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:06,810
Actually when you go to any guru, you must also find out

341
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:10,894
from the disciples, if they have achieved any powers or not.

342
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,769
It is not important if a guru says, "I am such and such".

343
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:18,644
For example, the lady who came to interview Me, she said,

344
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:22,143
"Do You think you are the highest saint of India?" and all that.

345
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:26,352
I said, "I never said so. But the saints in India do say so."

346
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,226
All right. If you believe in it or not makes no difference.

347
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:32,226
It is for you to find out. But leave alone Me,

348
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:35,352
why not find out about yourself, what happens to you.

349
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,143
Supposing you become the saint, supposing you have the powers,

350
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:43,310
supposing you manifest that compassion which I am talking of,

351
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:46,727
then you have to believe that there is something about yourself.

352
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,435
First of all you all must have faith in yourselves,

353
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:53,352
that you are capable of becoming that Self,

354
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,226
which is collectively conscious to begin with,

355
00:24:57,602 --> 00:25:02,852
which is the source of all the joy, health, wealth

356
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:05,769
and all kinds of satisfaction,

357
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:10,393
and the one which is the witness of the play of Divine,

358
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:16,685
the one that allows you to transmit this Divine power to others.

359
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:20,185
After realisation, for example Dr. Warren himself

360
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,685
was very reluctant in the beginning.

361
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,143
He was a difficult person to begin with.

362
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:27,018
Then he got his realisation

363
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,060
and after realisation he was quite satisfied.

364
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:32,060
Because he had been to so many gurus.

365
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:34,060
There's no guru he had not been.

366
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:41,101
And he was so angry and aggressive when he came to Sahaja Yoga.

367
00:25:41,352 --> 00:25:46,393
When he got into realisation, he just felt that he has found it.

368
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:50,560
Now, through him in Australia we have established

369
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:54,101
so many centres, and so many people have got realisation.

370
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,894
It's a surprising thing that one man,

371
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,976
who reluctantly came to Me on a telephone number,

372
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:04,769
has suddenly become such an enlightened person,

373
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:08,560
that he has given realisation to so many people,

374
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,852
and to whom he has given realisation, have

375
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:14,685
also given Realisation to so many others.

376
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:18,810
Apart from that they have cured diseases like cancer

377
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:23,477
and all kinds of serious diseases we talk about. It's a fact.

378
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:27,185
For this you cannot pay. That's one thing for sure.

379
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:29,393
You cannot pay for it. It's all free.

380
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:32,934
As this nature is free to give you everything

381
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,727
that is essential and vital within you.

382
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:41,060
In the same way this knowledge has to be without any effort.

383
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,018
Supposing if we have to learn about breathing,

384
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:49,018
going to a library, how many of us would survive?

385
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:53,018
It is so vital that it has to be the easiest, the simplest

386
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:56,185
and everything that is living is so simple,

387
00:26:56,393 --> 00:27:00,185
that we don't also bother to think about it.

388
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:04,435
We take all this for granted.

389
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:08,602
The subject is very wide.

390
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,435
It has many aspects and dimensions.

391
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:15,976
First when the Kundalini rises, it crosses through this center,

392
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:18,727
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

393
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:23,518
which is the chakra of our Lord Jesus Christ.

394
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,226
Tomorrow I'll be telling you the names of all the deities,

395
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,435
who reside on these centers.

396
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:31,060
Now it is difficult for a scientist to accept,

397
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:35,310
that there are deities who are sitting on these chakras.

398
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:39,727
But Socrates and Confucius who were such ancient people,

399
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:43,727
have talked about these Gods, that we have to keep them pleased

400
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,810
and you have to keep them all right.

401
00:27:45,976 --> 00:27:48,518
But those realised souls perhaps you don't know.

402
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:53,310
That's not easy to convince human beings who are not realised souls

403
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:57,935
about these deities being within you.

404
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,976
And they are all just waiting there.

405
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:06,727
As soon as the Kundalini rises you start manifesting your grandeur,

406
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:09,852
your great personality that awaits you.

407
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,602
This is something not fantastic to Me,

408
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,852
because I've seen thousands of people getting realisation,

409
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,644
thousands of them feeling the cool breeze,

410
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,393
thousands of them transforming.

411
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:26,644
Another thing one has to see in a person, in a guru,

412
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,976
when you go to a guru, that

413
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:32,935
'Is this the man giving any transformation to another person?'

414
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:36,352
Here they are, they are smuggling, they are telling lies,

415
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,518
they are killing people and they have a guru.

416
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:39,810
How can you have a guru,

417
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:43,101
when you are doing all these anti-God activities?

418
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,393
All kinds of anti-God activities they are doing:

419
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:51,143
They are hot-tempered, they are liars, they are intriguers,

420
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,685
all sorts of things they'll be doing

421
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,727
and they will be saying that "We have a guru".

422
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,810
What's the use of such a guru, who allows you to do these things?

423
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:02,769
It's better not to have such a guru who allows you to do that.

424
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,810
Secondly, a guru if you have a real one,

425
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:08,935
he has to look after your health, minimum of minimum.

426
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:12,310
But if you go to a guru and if you get epilepsy

427
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,644
or if you go to a guru and you get a bad head

428
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:18,101
or some sort of a headache, then he says,

429
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,976
"All right, these are your sins, you better suffer".

430
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,060
So one should ask a question to such a guru,

431
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:27,518
that, "Then why are you there? Why are we paying you for?

432
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:31,143
If you can't even look after our health,what are we paying you for?"

433
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,226
There could be a guru who can teach you something,

434
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,477
like he'll say that, "I'll make you fly".

435
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:38,810
So you must ask the guru to fly himself.

436
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,101
If the guru can fly, then you pay him.

437
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,894
What's the use of paying a guru who just says, you can fly.

438
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,769
"All right, you give me six thousand pounds, I'll make you fly."

439
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,852
Better ask the guru to fly and see that he flies.

440
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:52,477
But people are so identified with the gurus,

441
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,518
that despite they become absolutely bankrupt, finished,

442
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:59,644
gone cases, still they are sticking on to these gurus,

443
00:29:59,934 --> 00:30:00,935
because they are mesmerised.

444
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:03,935
They don't want to have their own Self-realisation,

445
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:06,185
they don't want to have their own powers,

446
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:09,810
but they want to abide by the so-called powers of their guru

447
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:13,685
and all these things. They become absolutely hopeless cases,

448
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:16,852
gone cases, good for nothing, lost people,

449
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:20,185
but still they'll stick on to these people and

450
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:24,352
will continue with it till they are perished as useless cabbages.

451
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,602
It's a very common thing, I've seen of some of the people

452
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,310
who teach that you must starve now, you must starve.

453
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:31,727
And the guru eats well,

454
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:34,518
but all the disciples are starving and suffering.

455
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,268
There's one thing more in Sahaja Yoga,

456
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:38,602
you are not supposed to suffer anymore.

457
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:42,101
There's no need to suffer.

458
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,560
Christ has suffered. He has suffered for us.

459
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,769
Now, no more suffering is needed for anyone of you.

460
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:52,518
Tomorrow I'll tell you how, when Christ is awakened,

461
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,018
you can feel

462
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:58,644
your so-called karmas and your so-called

463
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:01,101
egos and all that just are sucked in.

464
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,976
Here as you will see, ego is created with this right side power

465
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:12,393
called as the kriya shakti, is the power of action.

466
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:16,727
And when it moves further and further and touches the other side

467
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:19,393
which is the superego, then

468
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:22,435
in the center here, on the fontanel bone area,

469
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,685
a calcification takes place.

470
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:27,976
And when that happens you develop your I-ness.

471
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:33,602
You become "I", Mr." I", Mr."Second I", Mr. "Third I".

472
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:37,393
Now, this is like an egg we can say,

473
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:39,934
which has to be transformed into a bird.

474
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:45,143
In Sanskrit a realised soul is called as 'vijaha', means twice born.

475
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:48,560
And also a bird is called as twice-born.

476
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:53,810
In the same way a human being which looks so insipid, so boring,

477
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:57,185
so useless, sometimes he also condemns himself for nothing at all,

478
00:31:57,393 --> 00:32:00,602
sometimes you find him so bombastic, so egoistical,

479
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,352
so horrible, so aggressive.

480
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,518
All these people are nothing but these little eggs.

481
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:11,935
Only thing what one has to do is to transform them into the bird.

482
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:14,934
The bird, that is a free bird,

483
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,769
which understands what is wrong with you,

484
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:22,352
what is wrong with others and how to correct yourself.

485
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:25,934
Because the Spirit is the master, is the guru.

486
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:29,727
Your Spirit is your master. You are your own master.

487
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,769
You become your own master

488
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:35,477
and you start understanding everything one by one.

489
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:38,060
I am just your Mother. I'll decode for you,

490
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,810
I'll tell you what is what, what is this.

491
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:45,101
Once you understand that and you start finding it out,

492
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,393
you yourself will be amazed, that

493
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,685
not only that you can cure yourself,

494
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:51,435
you can raise your own Kundalini,

495
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:53,477
you can work it out on yourself

496
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,518
and keep your transformation moving further and further,

497
00:32:56,727 --> 00:33:00,935
but you become entitled, endowed with powers,

498
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,352
that you can give realisations to others,

499
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,644
you can do all these things by yourself,

500
00:33:06,894 --> 00:33:09,810
and it is such a remarkable thing, which must be achieved.

501
00:33:09,976 --> 00:33:13,727
Because if you see the condition of this world today,

502
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:15,310
it is in a very big mess.

503
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:19,393
I don't know if people understand it what we are facing.

504
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:23,810
We are just like the tree as I told you, which has lost his roots,

505
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:26,644
and anytime it can be destroyed.

506
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:30,769
It is very important today that all of us must seek

507
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:33,393
and find the Spirit.

508
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:37,185
Everybody who has told this, they were not liars,

509
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:39,185
they are not telling us wrong things.

510
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,393
Traditionally everyone has said the same thing.

511
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:46,101
Now these gurus can also start some untraditional stuff,

512
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,268
and people believe it, because it is something new.

513
00:33:49,518 --> 00:33:53,018
This is the higher evolution of a person

514
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:56,310
where you arrive at a point,

515
00:33:56,518 --> 00:34:00,976
where you become the witness of the play of the whole game.

516
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:03,644
For example a thought rises and falls off,

517
00:34:03,852 --> 00:34:05,934
another thought rises and falls off.

518
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:08,560
Between these thoughts there is a little space

519
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,852
and this space is the present,

520
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:14,268
while we live in the present or the past.

521
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:20,934
But - we live in the present, we don't live in the present,

522
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,560
but we live in the future or in the past.

523
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:26,644
Now the past doesn't exist, because it's over,

524
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,560
and the present (should be FUTURE) doesn't exist at all.

525
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,727
So our thoughts are all the time moving like that.

526
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:37,060
If somehow you can stop yourself at the point that is the present,

527
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:42,894
then you start enjoying the dynamics of every moment which you live.

528
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:46,477
And that's what is achieved through Kundalini awakening.

529
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:49,644
As I told you this subject matter is very great.

530
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:54,894
In an introduction I have tried to cover lots of points,

531
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,976
which people have been asking Me all over the world.

532
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:00,268
And if you have any new points to ask Me,

533
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,894
I'll be very happy to answer you.

534
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,935
Tomorrow I'll tell you actually

535
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:07,435
what happens, when the Kundalini rises.

536
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:10,018
I would like you to
ask Me questions

537
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:14,018
and after that we will have the session of realisation,

538
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:16,727
which may take hardly ten to fifteen minutes.

539
00:35:17,018 --> 00:35:19,810
May God bless you all.

540
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:24,644
Can I have questions from you?

541
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:42,060
You have a question? Anyone with questions...

542
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:45,644
This is the best way to openly talk.

543
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:49,685
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

544
00:35:49,934 --> 00:35:51,810
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

545
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:54,352
No, tomorrow I'll tell you the difference,

546
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,685
but if you want I tell you mind and Spirit are two different things.

547
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:08,018
In English language what we call mind it's a confusing thing.

548
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:12,393
But it's simple to understand.

549
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:18,143
Now here you see is an institution,

550
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:23,310
which looks like a blue balloon in the head.

551
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,560
That is the mind.

552
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:33,852
It is created by the action of the power of desire.

553
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:37,894
which we call in psychology as superego,

554
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:41,934
which is the result of all our conditionings, is the mind.

555
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:45,560
You can call it manasa. In Sanskrit language is manasa.

556
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:51,852
Now on the right side, the yellow coloured line, you see,

557
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:56,644
ends up into another yellow coloured institution,

558
00:36:56,852 --> 00:37:02,976
is a result or a by-product of our activity,

559
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:09,602
physical and through our brain, which we call as mental.

560
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,060
This creates an institution called ego.

561
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:18,101
So we have got superego as well as ego.

562
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:21,226
Supposing you tell somebody, "Don't do like this.

563
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:24,935
It is not to be done. You have to be disciplined like that."

564
00:37:25,185 --> 00:37:27,226
Then, if you go too much with it,

565
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:29,644
then conditioning takes place in a person.

566
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:34,976
And these conditionings are expressed as a balloon there,

567
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:38,518
which is a by-product of conditionings.

568
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:43,435
And the another one is the by-product of our activity,

569
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,143
which is mental as well as physical.

570
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:52,852
So we have two things, one is the manasa, is mana.

571
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,644
I don't know, in English it is called as mind,

572
00:37:56,852 --> 00:38:02,101
but it is confusion, because they call a mental case to a mad man and

573
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:05,894
when you work through your brain, you call it a mental activity.

574
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,310
So I would suggest, that if the confusion has to be understood,

575
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,644
has to be understood properly.

576
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:18,810
What happens to a man who works through his brain too much,

577
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,560
gets a heart attack.

578
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,976
It's surprising, he should get something wrong there -

579
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,185
but no, he gets a heart attack.

580
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:30,644
A man, who works for the future through his mental capacity,

581
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,310
gets a heart attack, means a balance.

582
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:38,685
And then a man, who works with his emotions too much,

583
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:44,393
gets this brain which is degenerated, so you call it mental.

584
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:48,769
So because of this the confusion is there, because of the balance.

585
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:51,268
It's surprising, that in a mental hospital

586
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:55,185
you don't need anything to find out about heart,

587
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,393
electrocardiogram and all that is not needed,

588
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:01,143
because a mental case never gets a heart attack normally.

589
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:04,477
So because of this confusion people call a mental case

590
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:08,602
to a person who actually uses his emotional side.

591
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:15,185
So for all our purposes we use a pure word called superego and ego.

592
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,685
Now apart from that we have got the Spirit

593
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:22,143
and the Spirit is in the heart.

594
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,018
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

595
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:29,810
Another thing we have got down below, is the Kundalini.

596
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,602
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

597
00:39:33,852 --> 00:39:38,560
And Holy Ghost is the All Pervading Power of God's Love.

598
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,518
So that's how we have these four things separated.

599
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,352
Another thing we have got, which is the attention,

600
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,852
which is sustained by our liver.

601
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:51,769
So now you understand we have a heart, we have an ego and superego,

602
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:55,268
and we have got that power which is sleeping,

603
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,101
which is to be awakened within us, which is called as Kundalini.

604
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:01,852
In the Bible also it is said that,

605
00:40:02,018 --> 00:40:05,477
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

606
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:09,310
And what you see is, are these centres, when they are enlightened,

607
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:11,644
they look like tongues of flames of different colours,

608
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:13,268
as shown you the picture.

609
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:18,935
But ultimately the thousand petaled lotus here

610
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:23,727
has many colours, all the seven colours of the rainbow.

611
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,560
I hope it is clear to the subject.

612
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:33,769
So far our Spirit has not come into our attention.

613
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,727
Yes, speak.

614
00:40:43,935 --> 00:40:47,477
Is there any danger in Kundalini path being awakened too quickly?

615
00:40:47,685 --> 00:40:50,101
I'm sorry I should have tackled this question everybody ask,

616
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,268
it is true. Because so many books have been written about Kundalini,

617
00:40:53,477 --> 00:40:57,976
which are horrifying things and there is no danger at all.

618
00:40:58,185 --> 00:41:00,976
Kundalini is your own Mother.

619
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:04,352
She bears all the things, She bears all the problems for you.

620
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,769
She is your own Mother.

621
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:09,393
She's just waiting for the moment to give you realisation,

622
00:41:09,602 --> 00:41:12,477
so there is somebody who knows the job!

623
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:15,518
But those people who have written about Kundalini -

624
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:19,560
I've seen one book which was written, I was amazed how these people,

625
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,435
could write about Kundalini, all this nonsense

626
00:41:22,644 --> 00:41:25,060
in such a big book and selling it,

627
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:28,852
which has no relevance at all to the state of Kundalini,

628
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:32,268
to the nature of Kundalini, even to the seat of Kundalini.

629
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:37,143
They are so confused, but the realm of God,

630
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:40,435
everybody tries to handle, is the sad part,

631
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:42,934
that everyone tries to handle that realm

632
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,852
and they can say whatever they like.

633
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:46,685
There is no danger at all,

634
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:50,560
we have given realisation to thousands and thousands of people.

635
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:52,935
Of course, when the Kundalini is rising,

636
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,018
if you have any opposition within yourself

637
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:57,185
due to a disease or trouble

638
00:41:57,393 --> 00:42:00,477
maybe little bit, you might feel hot in the hand.

639
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,310
But nothing more than that, or less than that.

640
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:06,934
It is a very beautiful experience, very pleasant

641
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,685
and great pleasure to Me.

642
00:42:11,518 --> 00:42:12,310
Yes.

643
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:19,018
Is this Kundalini energy active at birth?

644
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,810
Is it there at birth?

645
00:42:22,435 --> 00:42:25,101
Is the Kundalini energy present at birth?

646
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:31,268
Yes! About two months or so, when you are in a foetus,

647
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:35,060
it enters into your being, which is present there throughout.

648
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,518
Is it present before birth?

649
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,644
No, not before birth, how can it be present?

650
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:49,644
You see, in the sense that in the womb it is present.

651
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:53,185
It is in the womb of the mother, as the foetus it does, but

652
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:55,352
before the foetus is formed, how can it be present,

653
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,976
there has to be something to be present in.

654
00:42:58,185 --> 00:43:01,435
So it is there when the foetus is about two months of age,

655
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:08,060
it starts expressing itself there, it is there. All right?

656
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,226
Should we do any practice for tomorrow?

657
00:43:13,435 --> 00:43:14,018
For?

658
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:16,268
Should we practice anything?

659
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:17,935
Should we practice anything...?

660
00:43:18,268 --> 00:43:20,644
For tomorrow at this level.

661
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:21,477
I see.

662
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,685
Should they practice anything for tomorrow?

663
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,185
Could I make an announcement about the workshop?

664
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:27,894
All right.

665
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:32,185
We haven't told you but tomorrow during the day we've got a workshop

666
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:33,934
for those who would like can come along.

667
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,976
May be a little inconvenient but

668
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:39,268
for those who would like to come along, there's a place for your coming.

669
00:43:39,477 --> 00:43:41,060
Today we'll work it out also.

670
00:43:41,268 --> 00:43:42,560
You can come along but

671
00:43:42,769 --> 00:43:44,435
we'll make an announcement at the end of the program,

672
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:46,477
and the answer is yes.

673
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:49,602
But Mataji will show you at the end of the lecture

674
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:53,185
after you have the experience.

675
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,602
He seems to be a great seeker.

676
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,685
Is there any other question please?

677
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:24,852
Is this spontaneous awakening, as opposed to the more dangerous

678
00:44:25,393 --> 00:44:29,852
awakening that occurs some,  by some people,

679
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:32,935
due to Your Power?

680
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:38,477
It's very embarrassing.

681
00:44:39,101 --> 00:44:41,852
It is not due to Us at all, that's all I can say,

682
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:43,727
but you have got your own power.

683
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,435
Now say for example if there is a light,

684
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:49,018
a candle that is enlightened, all right,

685
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,934
and if it has to enlighten another light -

686
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:56,602
is it the power of this candle that you will say that has enlightened?

687
00:44:57,018 --> 00:45:01,018
Because the candle itself is ready, this candle is enlightened,

688
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,976
it just touches the other candle

689
00:45:03,185 --> 00:45:05,560
and that candle gets enlightened by itself,

690
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,518
because it is just ready.

691
00:45:09,602 --> 00:45:12,310
I understand, from the nature I think that

692
00:45:12,518 --> 00:45:16,976
You have so many of the yoga teachings.

693
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:19,185
What's it?

694
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:22,185
Periods of starving and endeavour

695
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:25,685
hopefully with Kundalini (...)

696
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:29,727
and sometimes, it's told, it will be in the next life.

697
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,934
He said, from the reading and traditionally it's said that

698
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:39,352
Kundalini rises slowly and it has to be the result of certain things

699
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,518
and I think he's a little puzzled, how it can be now

700
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,727
in Your presence.

701
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:48,268
Have you read Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya?

702
00:45:48,477 --> 00:45:50,435
He's the master of this, all right?

703
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:55,352
What he says that, "Mother can do it",  that's it.

704
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:58,060
You have to find out about Myself.

705
00:45:58,268 --> 00:46:00,101
All right? I'll better not tell you.

706
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,435
To be tactful, one should not talk about oneself.

707
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:04,018
It's a dangerous thing.

708
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,143
Christ has said, "I'm the life, I'm the path",

709
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:08,101
and people crucified Him.

710
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:11,393
Just see! You dare not say anything about yourself.

711
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,060
If you say, they will just trouble you.

712
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:15,435
It's better to keep quiet.

713
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:18,976
I'll do what I have to do, then you find out about Me. All right?

714
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:23,060
I don't want to say anything, because if I say anything, you feel hurt.

715
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:28,101
But please, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not questioning You.

716
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:29,185
I cannot...

717
00:46:29,393 --> 00:46:31,435
I'm trying to find out the balance,

718
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,976
thinking that spontaneous comes to me.

719
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:37,185
I personally am endeavoured to the Kriya Yoga.

720
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:38,143
Yoga?

721
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:39,018
Kriya Yoga.

722
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:45,185
All right. All right. I understand you.

723
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:51,518
Now, I'll tell you about. Kriya Yoga is against spontaneous.

724
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:53,727
(...)  completely.

725
00:46:53,934 --> 00:46:56,769
And by Kriya Yoga you cannot get  realisation.

726
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:58,435
There is no Kriya Yoga.

727
00:46:58,644 --> 00:47:01,226
In no traditional book it is there, no traditional.

728
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,644
This is a new thing started by people,

729
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:06,393
they used to even cut the tongues of people,

730
00:47:06,602 --> 00:47:09,393
say that you put it back here, put the tracheae,

731
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:12,143
do all kinds of things. There are many people in India who have

732
00:47:12,352 --> 00:47:17,727
their tongues waving like dogs, who have been to Kriya.

733
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:20,268
There's no such things needed at all.

734
00:47:20,477 --> 00:47:22,143
It is spontaneous, it is within you,

735
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,602
you don't have to do anything about it. That is what it is!

736
00:47:25,852 --> 00:47:27,018
Absolutely!

737
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:29,602
You don't have to do anything, you don't have to stand on your head,

738
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,185
or nothing at all. It's just simple.

739
00:47:32,393 --> 00:47:34,976
So Kriya Yoga is not sahaja.

740
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,644
'Is not sahaja' means

741
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:40,226
'saha' means 'with' and 'ja' is 'born'. It's spontaneous.

742
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:43,518
It is a spontaneous thing, you don't have to do anything about it.

743
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,143
Nothing.

744
00:47:47,018 --> 00:47:51,810
But once you get it, once you get it, you can give it to others.

745
00:47:51,976 --> 00:47:54,560
It's like if you know how to swim

746
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:58,226
and if there's somebody who does not know and he is getting drowned.

747
00:47:58,435 --> 00:47:59,769
What you tell that person, that

748
00:47:59,935 --> 00:48:02,518
"You keep quiet just now, I'll take you to the shore".

749
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:04,101
Then you are brought to the shore

750
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:07,894
and you teach him how to swim, and then he can save others also.

751
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,935
But the one who does not know how to swim,

752
00:48:10,143 --> 00:48:14,852
has to do nothing for the time being, just to get his realisation,

753
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:18,018
mature in it and then give realisation to others.

754
00:48:18,226 --> 00:48:21,310
No Kriya is needed at all in Sahaja Yoga.

755
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:23,226
Actually it is not at all traditional.

756
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:25,644
It is a very recent stuff that has come out.

757
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:28,810
If you read from the past, if you read Adi Shankaracharya,

758
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:31,644
the sixth century, if you read other people, Markandeya like,

759
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:34,477
fourteenth century, you'll be amazed, that

760
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:38,143
they have said the same thing what I am saying; this is traditional.

761
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:42,226
But these new gurus came up, they started talking about this and that,

762
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:43,894
but it is not so.

763
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:46,934
Nobody can achieve realisation by Kriya Yoga.

764
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:50,185
I've not met one. On the contrary they come to Me as patients.

765
00:48:50,477 --> 00:48:53,352
I must say, I'm sorry to say, but it is so.

766
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,185
People have spent so much money,

767
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:59,310
from India they have gone all the way to America to do Kriya Yoga

768
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,435
and they are just suffering. Nobody has achieved anything.

769
00:49:02,644 --> 00:49:04,769
So now whatever you have done, it's finished.

770
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:07,685
Now you be interested in yourself and in your seeking.

771
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:09,976
Just forget it whatever you have done.

772
00:49:10,185 --> 00:49:11,560
Now what you have to do is,

773
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:14,560
to just get your realisation and work it out.

774
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:17,310
Forget it whatever you have been doing,

775
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:19,560
because you have not yet achieved the result.

776
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:20,644
So forget it!

777
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:24,644
And see for yourself without any Kriya you receive it or not.

778
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:26,810
It is all described but the trouble is,

779
00:49:26,976 --> 00:49:30,976
all the Sanskrit books which are authentic are not being translated.

780
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:33,560
So it's not traditional at all.

781
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:37,393
Christ never said you have to do anything like that.

782
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:41,060
Nobody has said it. Everybody has talked of spontaneous happening.

783
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,560
Even Martin Luther, when he tried to change people from Catholicism,

784
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,477
he talked of spontaneity.

785
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:50,268
He was also a realised soul, but later on his followers

786
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:52,268
tried to make a mess of everything.

787
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,018
In the same way Christ also talked of the same thing.

788
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:57,518
Did they say that you have to stand on your head, cut your tongues,

789
00:49:57,727 --> 00:49:59,352
put them back, push it back?

790
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,143
All these things are absolutely not to be done.

791
00:50:02,352 --> 00:50:05,602
It's very harmful, one should never do it.

792
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,685
So let us have now the experiment, all right?

793
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:18,268
All of you are seekers.

794
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:21,852
Now forget what you have been doing, what is done, forget it.

795
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,435
Because you have been -

796
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:26,769
you have to be kind to yourself, to be truthful to yourself,

797
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,185
you have to be your Self.

798
00:50:28,435 --> 00:50:31,769
I'm the only person who'll say that you have to get to it.

799
00:50:31,935 --> 00:50:34,435
If you don't get it, I will not rest and you should not rest.

800
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:37,477
If I have patience for you, you should also have patience for you.

801
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,644
Don't be angry with anyone, don't be angry with yourself,

802
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:42,060
don't be angry with your gurus,

803
00:50:42,268 --> 00:50:44,685
whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

804
00:50:44,894 --> 00:50:49,810
You'll be amazed, I Myself get surprised the way Divine is working.

805
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:53,894
Whatever you may do it, whatever may be the problems, it works,

806
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,644
it works, really it works.

807
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,602
It's something so amazing.

808
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,852
It is better that you see to it, that you get it.

809
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,852
Because you are seekers of ages.

810
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:05,560
This is not a life you are wasting, you have been seeking for ages.

811
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:09,602
And today the time has come, that's why you are here to get it.

812
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:12,727
So please just get your realisation. Forget the past.

813
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:17,518
May God bless you all.

814
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:35,560
I would request you for a simple thing:

815
00:51:35,769 --> 00:51:36,852
we have to take out our shoes,

816
00:51:37,018 --> 00:51:39,310
because the Mother Earth also takes away our problems.

817
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:41,518
She's very helpful. Even the light is helpful.

818
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:44,226
Now some people ask, "Why the light?" Even this little light

819
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,852
is so helpful, if it is there. Just take out your shoes.

820
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:52,852
Just to take help from the Mother Earth. It's very simple.

821
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:56,935
Now you have to put your both the hands towards Me like this

822
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:58,310
in a very simple way.

823
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,101
First of all you should be comfortably seated.

824
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,934
There should be no discomfort,

825
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,685
so that when it is happening you again get distracted.

826
00:52:04,894 --> 00:52:08,185
Just to sit comfortably, have easy sitting,

827
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:16,310
no, no tightening in the neck or in the -

828
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:18,894
I mean uncomfortable tightening.

829
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,769
It's all right, if you can feel comfortable.
