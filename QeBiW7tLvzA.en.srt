1
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,799
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:07,000
As it is, today, a question has been put forward before Me

3
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:14,527
that why our attention gets lost; in the modern times,

4
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:19,300
why our attention is not towards God.

5
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,097
And that, in modern times,

6
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:28,965
why a human being has gone down in his quality of humanity.

7
00:48:31,032 --> 00:48:35,024
These questions point out to one single fact

8
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:43,225
that our attention has been challenged by modern times.

9
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:02,200
This attention has been challenged

10
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:05,715
by all that we call modern today.

11
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:12,165
I do not say that we have to be primitive people.

12
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:21,445
In this great country of ours, India, which was Bharatvarsh,

13
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:24,810
we had such a great quality of humanity,

14
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:31,771
such a great quality of administration,

15
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:39,625
quality of kings, queens; all that was not a myth.

16
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:45,445
It was a fact that we had Rama, Krishna

17
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:52,630
the benevolent king and a great diplomat of the divine force.

18
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:58,818
But today we find all these things sound like mythical

19
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:04,355
because at what level we are, we see that as the truth,

20
00:50:04,556 --> 00:50:08,230
as the reality - but it is not.

21
00:50:08,988 --> 00:50:13,335
All this is created by human beings.

22
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:18,440
How this is created, and why it has happened,

23
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:22,039
I would like to explain to you.

24
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:29,927
When our attention was created before, in a way

25
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:36,182
that we were living with very few things in this country,

26
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:46,147
everyone knew that you have to have your self-realization.

27
00:50:46,348 --> 00:50:48,981
Nobody bothered their heads about

28
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:53,701
how much wealth you are going to acquire,
how many things we are going to have,

29
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:58,202
except for the kings who acquired wealth

30
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:02,369
for the betterment of the society and also

31
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:08,257
who acquired the power for the protection of the society.

32
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:14,410
Then we became slaves of two cultures

33
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:19,712
One the Islamic, another the British culture,

34
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:21,313
the English culture.

35
00:51:22,257 --> 00:51:24,038
And I think the real downfall came

36
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:27,186
when this English culture came upon us.

37
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:30,803
Because, though they were Muslims they believed in God.

38
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:32,412
Whatever wrong they did,

39
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:36,116
they did it in the name of God and they believed it.

40
00:51:36,317 --> 00:51:39,720
But the attention was not, still, in acquiring things.

41
00:51:39,921 --> 00:51:42,592
We say that Aurangazeb was a very bad king, no doubt.

42
00:51:42,793 --> 00:51:46,386
He killed so many Hindus because he believed

43
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:49,201
that Islam is the only religion.

44
00:51:49,402 --> 00:51:51,370
That was his stupidity I should say.

45
00:51:51,571 --> 00:51:54,242
He was ignorant; he was so violent.

46
00:51:54,454 --> 00:52:00,276
But he himself was an extremely frugal person.

47
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,442
He used to make his own caps,

48
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:04,775
sell them in the market and live on that.

49
00:52:04,976 --> 00:52:10,775
And he would not touch any money of the public.

50
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:15,453
But then the English, when they started ruling in this country,

51
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:18,292
this language English came upon us

52
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:22,837
as not a blessing but a curse, I think.

53
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:29,335
Because the whole literature is full with ideas

54
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:33,965
which are contrary to the culture of God,

55
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,390
contrary to the culture of Christ.

56
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:40,940
They believed that Christ was born in England.

57
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:44,751
Many Christians still believe that you become a sahab

58
00:52:44,952 --> 00:52:46,891
when you become Christians.

59
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,767
This culture of the English which was forced on us,

60
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,070
this language which was forced on us,

61
00:52:55,304 --> 00:53:01,455
gave us a absolutely a different direction

62
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:04,437
which we should not have accepted.

63
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,765
But as it is, we were three hundred years already in the slavery,

64
00:53:08,984 --> 00:53:12,617
people had to accept it blindfolded.

65
00:53:13,672 --> 00:53:16,221
Shri Krishna has clearly said

66
00:53:16,422 --> 00:53:21,029
that the awareness grows downward

67
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:27,406
while the roots are in the brain of a person;

68
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:33,085
and the awareness, which is growing downwards,

69
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:39,050
forms the tree. And this western culture is the one,

70
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:43,368
which makes you grow downwards towards materialism;

71
00:53:43,603 --> 00:53:47,999
whether it is communism or it is socialism or democracy

72
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,616
that makes no difference.

73
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:57,301
The whole thing is that you have to attend to the material side.

74
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:03,077
So the first object of the western culture

75
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:08,449
or the western science was, first to capture the matter,

76
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,809
the five elements in such a way

77
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:13,636
that it can be used for the comfort of human beings,

78
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:18,410
for the physical comfort of human beings.

79
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:22,941
But as the culture is just to move forward

80
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:25,845
without any control over yourself,

81
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:29,131
like a kite flying in the air

82
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:34,603
without having any control of a finger on it,

83
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,731
the whole thing drifted into various

84
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:46,350
directions and various fields, where it got lost.

85
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:52,918
When we pay attention to something, if the attention is pure,

86
00:54:53,127 --> 00:55:00,435
it will purify the matter and will come back to us as a pure attention.

87
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:03,661
But when the attention is filled with these ideas

88
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:08,634
that you have to use all the matter for your comfort,

89
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:11,272
then it gets lost in the matter.

90
00:55:11,473 --> 00:55:15,194
It gets involved in the matter. It gets spoilt in the matter,

91
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:21,309
and then what comes back to us is the thought, “How to possess it”.

92
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:27,086
To possess the matter, to use the matter,

93
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:31,223
to sit on top of the matter was the first mistake.

94
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:34,746
Matter is your slave, in any case.

95
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:39,472
In any case it is your slave, and this you would have got it

96
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:42,064
without paying so much attention to it.

97
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:46,324
To think that science was discovered by scientists is egoistical.

98
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:48,438
Its only your ego, says that.

99
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,230
You cannot discover anything unless and until

100
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,774
the God’s grace is upon you.

101
00:55:54,189 --> 00:55:56,789
It’s the God’s grace that brings forth

102
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:02,186
the exposition of His powers.

103
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:06,572
Even a person like Einstein has said that.

104
00:56:06,773 --> 00:56:11,617
Even the person like Newton has said that.

105
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:16,735
Einstein has clearly said that “I was fed up and I was tired;

106
00:56:16,936 --> 00:56:20,052
I couldn’t find the theory of relativity;

107
00:56:20,272 --> 00:56:25,188
I was just resting in my garden playing with soap bubbles,

108
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:28,372
and from somewhere unknown

109
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:32,474
the theory of relativity dawned upon me”.

110
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:36,921
But we Indians living, three hundred years

111
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,775
in the slavish mentality, accepted it blindfolded

112
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:44,464
without knowing how much knowledge and science we had.

113
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,464
We had aeroplanes in our country.

114
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:48,659
We had pilotless bombs in our country.

115
00:56:48,878 --> 00:56:51,745
We had all kinds of things in our country.

116
00:56:53,003 --> 00:57:00,008
But, why did we accept this without going into the roots

117
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:03,914
to find out how did we have these things?

118
00:57:04,115 --> 00:57:07,316
We started doubting all that was the past in India,

119
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:09,556
and we would not go into the past of it

120
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:14,624
but we started moving downward with this western culture.

121
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:18,525
And that’s the downfall of our country.

122
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,579
That has brought all this nonsense here.

123
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:26,035
When money becomes everything, the money orientation,

124
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,782
the economics of it.

125
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:32,809
This was the country of philosophers, of the seers,

126
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,749
of the saints, where now today economics is dominating

127
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:39,748
without understanding that you cannot put this western

128
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:43,682
economics in this country at all, we cannot work it out.

129
00:57:44,979 --> 00:57:47,872
This is a country of generosity.

130
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:50,574
People love to serve you, people love to do;

131
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:53,524
even today they like to do something for you.

132
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:57,004
Go to a village, even if they may not have anything with them,

133
00:57:57,205 --> 00:57:59,231
they’ll bring some milk; make you sit there.

134
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:02,064
“Please have some milk. You have come from foreign countries,

135
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:05,424
please have it.” But in the western countries:

136
00:58:05,643 --> 00:58:08,119
you may give them any amount of things,

137
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,978
they won’t even return one present to you.

138
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:13,046
Shamelessly they’ll take everything thinking

139
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:15,207
that they are the ones who should have it.

140
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:18,444
They have no subtleties.

141
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:22,647
They have no subtleties to understand generosity, they cannot.

142
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:26,204
They think we do it because we are slavish people.

143
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:31,009
Even I was surprised when the some villagers told Me

144
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:35,623
that even the animals coming from the West are stupid.

145
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:41,709
I said, “how?” He said, “Now take a hen from India

146
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:47,478
and take a leghorn or rooster from western countries.

147
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,186
If there is an attack on the little chicks,

148
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:55,919
the mother will start shouting or doing something,

149
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,619
screaming or doing something to call all her children

150
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,284
under her wings - if it’s an Indian hen.

151
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:03,958
But if it’s an English hen, she wouldn’t mind.

152
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:06,143
She would look at everything very peacefully,

153
00:59:06,323 --> 00:59:12,255
stithapragya, not bothered.” Then he said,

154
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:14,846
“Most surprising thing is that our bullocks,

155
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:18,924
if you tell them go this way, that way, they understand.

156
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:22,344
But if you tell a western bullock,

157
00:59:22,545 --> 00:59:25,310
he walks straight into the car, into the trucks;

158
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:29,329
he doesn’t know where he is walking. He has no idea.

159
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,829
You cannot leave them alone.

160
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,061
And if you tell them walk this way,

161
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:34,662
they will walk the other way round.”

162
00:59:34,981 --> 00:59:37,280
So what is in this culture?

163
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:46,360
What is in this whole upbringing that makes you so gross?

164
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,013
The attention is on the matter and not on the spirit.

165
00:59:51,248 --> 00:59:56,826
All the time the matter is trying to overpower the spirit.

166
00:59:57,647 --> 01:00:01,833
Supposing there is a tree that falls off, it dies,

167
01:00:02,034 --> 01:00:05,940
then you make a chair out of it. It’s a dead from the dead.

168
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:09,950
Now you sit on the chair and you become a slave of the chair.

169
01:00:10,151 --> 01:00:12,676
You cannot sit on the ground.

170
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:15,447
Then you have to carry chairs with you.

171
01:00:16,932 --> 01:00:19,066
If you start moving in a car,

172
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:24,754
you become so useless that you cannot walk with your legs.

173
01:00:25,817 --> 01:00:28,417
Tomorrow you start having calculators…

174
01:00:28,676 --> 01:00:30,030
you’ll be surprised, I live in London

175
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,018
I am amazed at the people.

176
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:36,414
Even if they have to do two plus two they want their tambaaku.

177
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,112
They want to calculate it.

178
01:00:39,323 --> 01:00:40,951
For two plus two they cannot do it,

179
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:44,066
they have no brains left because computers have come.

180
01:00:44,324 --> 01:00:46,975
So as a result of this machinery,

181
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,451
the machines that have created… We say the “machine age”

182
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:55,930
what an age it is - and the age of development.

183
01:00:56,131 --> 01:01:00,983
Without any control if the machines have

184
01:01:02,187 --> 01:01:06,189
gone up to this point, it is time that we understand

185
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,218
we should not go too much towards it,

186
01:01:09,438 --> 01:01:12,038
that we become slaves of this machine.

187
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:14,830
The machine is like a devil.

188
01:01:15,031 --> 01:01:20,993
It requires, like a devil, all the time to eat something.

189
01:01:21,236 --> 01:01:26,689
Like, you… in England it’s impossible to get fresh food.

190
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,960
You have to go to the main market to get it.

191
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:32,025
But in America, is even worse

192
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:35,908
and in most of the countries they have everything packed,

193
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,611
everything in a plastic bag, everything measured.

194
01:01:39,812 --> 01:01:43,491
You go to the shop, you get this, this, this, this… nothing fresh.

195
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:47,527
There’s no taste in the food. Now they are using chemicals.

196
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:50,879
They put chemicals in the body of the animals, which they eat;

197
01:01:51,061 --> 01:01:53,219
put chemicals in the foods that they eat;

198
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:57,873
put chemicals because the machine must have a quantity.

199
01:01:58,124 --> 01:02:00,399
To have the quantity they have to do all this.

200
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,608
So what you are taking is all this chemicals.

201
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:03,746
As a result of that,

202
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:08,155
what you are developing is nothing else but your destruction

203
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:12,605
So all this attention outside, into the matter,

204
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:16,426
builds up your destructions gradually.

205
01:02:17,512 --> 01:02:21,157
The attention gets fragmented.

206
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,855
For example, you are talking to someone…

207
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,292
this is a very modern stuff, I have seen many.

208
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:29,081
You are talking to someone and this person is looking somewhere else.

209
01:02:29,290 --> 01:02:30,195
“Where are you looking?”

210
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:36,198
“Oh, I was looking at that picture or something.

211
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:37,627
I think I should buy that.”

212
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:41,515
But I am talking to you here - doesn’t go into the head. Nothing.

213
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:44,586
He is looking at something, or at some woman,

214
01:02:44,766 --> 01:02:48,699
or at some man - which is joyless pursuit.

215
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:54,009
We have nothing to do with it and there is no alertness,

216
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:57,477
which picks up things at the right moment.

217
01:02:57,678 --> 01:02:59,704
Then another thing a gentleman told Me,

218
01:02:59,905 --> 01:03:01,818
whose four children are in an English school

219
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:04,339
and one child in an Indian school.

220
01:03:04,506 --> 01:03:08,297
He says these four children don’t talk much.

221
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:11,688
They think no end of themselves and they don’t know.

222
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:17,633
You ask them how many roads there are to your house?

223
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:19,029
They wouldn’t know.

224
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:24,011
They just go like a blinkers of a horse around their heads.

225
01:03:24,212 --> 01:03:26,490
They walk like that. They don’t know anything.

226
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:28,294
They don’t read newspapers;

227
01:03:28,495 --> 01:03:30,162
they have no ideas as to what things we have.

228
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:34,089
The youngest child, who is brought up in an Indian way

229
01:03:34,262 --> 01:03:37,105
and in an Indian school, has got a little parrot,

230
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:41,490
has got a little doggy, has… looks after all the cows.

231
01:03:41,691 --> 01:03:47,060
He gives all the news about all the animals in the house.

232
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,245
He gives all the news about the relations.

233
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:52,146
He knows who are the relations, who are suffering,

234
01:03:52,347 --> 01:03:55,511
what is the problem. What in the kitchen is needed?

235
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:58,443
He is so alert, his attention is so alert

236
01:03:58,644 --> 01:04:00,456
because it is not fragmented.

237
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,357
Now with any convenience,

238
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:08,550
we want to put our children into English schools.

239
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:11,427
I tell you, you’ll have it.

240
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:13,703
If they don’t beat you when they grow up,

241
01:04:13,904 --> 01:04:15,930
you shouldn’t be surprised. I’ve seen

242
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:18,755
western children beat their parents.

243
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:21,758
They answer them back.

244
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:25,204
It was a day when the children of a good family

245
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:30,334
would always address their parents as sir or mother as a madam.

246
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:34,332
But today, I have seen them answering them back

247
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,501
saying all kinds of funny things

248
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:38,736
and knowing all the filth of the world,

249
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,871
all the filth of the world.

250
01:04:41,072 --> 01:04:43,909
They know so much of filth that you are shocked;

251
01:04:44,144 --> 01:04:45,912
you don’t know that.

252
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:49,037
And the whole attitude of all their medias,

253
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:52,120
or ours also I should say, in a way,

254
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:54,604
is to create that attitude,

255
01:04:54,805 --> 01:04:57,377
to put our children into that filth all the time,

256
01:04:57,578 --> 01:04:59,273
take them to that filth.

257
01:05:00,578 --> 01:05:03,672
Our people also - I see in the television, here also

258
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:07,145
they show all these horribly nude

259
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:08,977
funny women in the advertisement.

260
01:05:09,177 --> 01:05:12,523
Because these advertisements, and the medias also,

261
01:05:12,724 --> 01:05:16,231
work out your attention onto the gross.

262
01:05:16,443 --> 01:05:19,726
They play on your weaknesses.

263
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:23,425
That’s how they make you weak, and when you become weak,

264
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:25,354
weak, they become very powerful.

265
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:29,142
When the media is so powerful, you can’t do anything.

266
01:05:29,386 --> 01:05:34,628
There is no purity in their hearts to do benevolence,

267
01:05:34,829 --> 01:05:37,204
to do good to the people - as we call janahith.

268
01:05:37,423 --> 01:05:41,527
That’s not in their mind at all. Somehow to make money.

269
01:05:41,728 --> 01:05:43,928
What’s the harm in making money?

270
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:47,713
It’s surprising how people are compromising

271
01:05:47,914 --> 01:05:51,695
for the sake of money. Money doesn’t give you joy.

272
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,312
I have to tell you it cannot give you joy.

273
01:05:54,524 --> 01:05:56,057
Don’t run after money.

274
01:05:56,297 --> 01:06:00,479
Have a integrated attitude towards money.

275
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,156
Money is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

276
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,986
and the Lakshmi is a very beautiful woman

277
01:06:07,187 --> 01:06:13,546
who has got a very motherly attitude. She is the Mother.

278
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:18,507
A man who has money has to have motherly attitude.

279
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,492
She has got two lotuses in Her hands;

280
01:06:22,693 --> 01:06:24,990
pink shows that She is love.

281
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:28,164
She expresses Her love in two of Her hands

282
01:06:28,365 --> 01:06:31,052
which also means a lotus which is pink,

283
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:39,109
is even entertaining a thorny bhavraa, we call it

284
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,320
the black big beetle, which has got thorns

285
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:49,430
on its soft petals and gives it a place of rest.

286
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,245
How many of these rich people in this country,

287
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:56,746
and specially abroad, would entertain such an idea

288
01:06:56,981 --> 01:07:00,692
of having a place for a ashrayaa,

289
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:05,996
for a support for the persons who are like a bhavraa.

290
01:07:09,466 --> 01:07:16,648
Then, the other hand, which is like this, has to be daan.

291
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:19,294
You have to give, if you have money you must give.

292
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:21,903
How many of them know where to give money?

293
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,799
They’ll give money to places

294
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,463
where people will cheat them - like Rajneesh.

295
01:07:28,831 --> 01:07:31,841
They’ll not give money to the poor.

296
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:35,870
They’ll not develop anything for the poor in a proper way.

297
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:38,122
The other day, I was surprised, I went to Poona.

298
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:41,833
We have there a very good thing system started

299
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:45,510
of called as JanaShanti where people give food

300
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:48,781
for two rupees, very good food for one, one meal,

301
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:52,422
very very good food, excellent food they give and sufficient

302
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:57,057
for two rupees. And they said all the, President downward,

303
01:07:57,258 --> 01:08:00,086
people came here; we had to spend money on their reception.

304
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:01,966
We gave them this that, garland,

305
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:05,295
this that and everybody gave big big lectures.

306
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:10,716
And nobody is willing to even give them a place on rent.

307
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:12,143
No one wants them there

308
01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:15,034
because they think you will go into competition

309
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:18,432
with others who are making profits and will not get votes.

310
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:22,080
So the whole system is so funny

311
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,095
that you end up at a point that

312
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:26,327
they want to give money because they want to have votes.

313
01:08:26,538 --> 01:08:30,116
They want to win the election because they want to make money.

314
01:08:30,366 --> 01:08:33,211
I mean, I came to this country and everybody is saying,

315
01:08:33,412 --> 01:08:36,122
“What’s the matter, why can’t we get the plot?”

316
01:08:36,326 --> 01:08:38,240
Because the person wants to eat the money;

317
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:41,297
here everybody eats the money,

318
01:08:41,498 --> 01:08:43,999
eating the money, paishe khaato.

319
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:46,695
Te paishe khata, te paishe khata, te paishe khata.

320
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:50,796
Say, don’t they eat their food, or why are they eating money?

321
01:08:50,984 --> 01:08:53,551
This is the trouble of this country has come because money

322
01:08:53,752 --> 01:08:56,829
has become the most important thing for them.

323
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:01,402
Nothing that they think that this body, this being,

324
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:05,723
this is a collective being. This is the samoohik being.

325
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,022
It cannot be happy with this kind of a harm

326
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:10,637
we are doing to our society.

327
01:09:10,838 --> 01:09:13,053
All those who do things like this,

328
01:09:13,254 --> 01:09:16,309
their seven generations will be cursed by God.

329
01:09:16,854 --> 01:09:17,776
You must understand:

330
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,080
those who make money at the cost of the poor people,

331
01:09:21,284 --> 01:09:23,217
they will be cursed forever.

332
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:26,837
And one should not join such people,

333
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,888
even if you have to suffer.

334
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:33,190
I know it’s very hard time, people cannot afford

335
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:37,279
to live with the earnings they have. But still, if you decide,

336
01:09:37,523 --> 01:09:41,295
you can live with the satisfaction that you have done right.

337
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:44,802
When My father was…

338
01:09:47,476 --> 01:09:50,608
and My mother, both were in jail so many times.

339
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:51,585
We were eleven children.

340
01:09:51,786 --> 01:09:54,262
We were very rich people living in huts.

341
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:57,772
And we didn’t have food for days together sometimes.

342
01:09:57,973 --> 01:10:00,043
And we have… were used to very rich life.

343
01:10:00,254 --> 01:10:03,793
They sacrificed everything for the country’s freedom.

344
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:06,496
Where are such people now? You can’t think of them.

345
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:07,684
They are legendary people.

346
01:10:07,885 --> 01:10:11,739
Nobody wants to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

347
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,778
And this is the movement;

348
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:17,596
this is a new movement of swatantra.

349
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:21,369
Swaatantrya is not yet complete; you can see it clearly.

350
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,961
It is not. Your freedom is not complete.

351
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:25,961
If your freedom has to be complete,

352
01:10:26,196 --> 01:10:28,846
you must get your swatantra;

353
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:33,921
you must know the technique of your swa, of your spirit.

354
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:36,828
Unless and until you get this full freedom,

355
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,015
you are not free people. You are slaves of money.

356
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:44,970
You are slaves of powers. You are slaves of showing off.

357
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:50,033
You are slaves of everything, to Me. All kinds of bad habits.

358
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:53,851
I’ve never known so many drunkards that we find these days.

359
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,655
So we have become greater slaves of all the bad habits,

360
01:10:57,867 --> 01:11:02,326
all the bad doings. And there is nothing

361
01:11:02,527 --> 01:11:07,660
that a person in a big position can think of not doing.

362
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:10,811
Why it has happened to us?

363
01:11:11,012 --> 01:11:16,537
Why have we all collapsed into such insipid useless people?

364
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:19,659
What has happened to our countrymen? Is this:

365
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:21,628
that they have not realized

366
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:28,607
that the greatest thing is in the brain. Is the roots,

367
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:33,277
and these roots are in this country, in this Maharastra.

368
01:11:33,551 --> 01:11:38,703
These roots are here. The Kundalini has to only enlighten these roots,

369
01:11:38,907 --> 01:11:42,446
and we never bothered about it. We never cared for it.

370
01:11:42,688 --> 01:11:46,421
We are all the time worried as to how to get more money.

371
01:11:46,714 --> 01:11:48,807
So the people who are highly paid

372
01:11:49,034 --> 01:11:52,486
or who are at a higher position with less pay, also maybe,

373
01:11:52,784 --> 01:11:55,317
they are making money by eating that.

374
01:11:55,589 --> 01:11:57,443
And the others are a sort of people

375
01:11:57,644 --> 01:12:00,604
who are going on strike for everything. For what?

376
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:02,904
For money, again for money.

377
01:12:03,105 --> 01:12:06,368
This Bombay is half finished because of strikes.

378
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,439
What for strikes? I asked them. You are a drunkard?

379
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,124
Yes. You drink? All right. And you smoke? Yes.

380
01:12:12,335 --> 01:12:14,673
You eat tambaaku? Yes. You eat paan.

381
01:12:14,874 --> 01:12:16,975
That means you have money.

382
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:19,772
Otherwise how can you afford all these things?

383
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:22,756
When you ask for more money in a strike,

384
01:12:22,992 --> 01:12:25,320
better find out what sort of a man he is.

385
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:26,816
If he can drink, afford to drink,

386
01:12:27,017 --> 01:12:29,610
then you need not give him any money to drink more.

387
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:32,212
Any mother who sees her son is drinking,

388
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:33,517
will never give him any money

389
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:35,209
because he will be drinking with that money.

390
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:39,092
What else is he going to do? What good is he going to do with that?

391
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:41,365
So what happens is that this attention,

392
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,019
when it starts moving towards money,

393
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:47,275
we become so blind that we do not see why,

394
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:53,666
why are we asking for money. What is the need for money?

395
01:12:53,867 --> 01:12:55,550
I am not for these capitalists at all.

396
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:57,595
I know how horrid they are.

397
01:12:57,796 --> 01:13:01,897
But what I’m saying that why break the machinery like this.

398
01:13:02,155 --> 01:13:03,822
Now whatever you may do,

399
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:06,653
whatever you may tell them that finish this striking

400
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:10,307
and enjoy yourself now, for the God sake.

401
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:14,514
We have really poor people in the villages, not in Bombay.

402
01:13:14,838 --> 01:13:16,313
In Bombay we don’t have poor people.

403
01:13:16,514 --> 01:13:18,881
They can go to cinema; they can do all kinds of things.

404
01:13:19,147 --> 01:13:22,579
How can they be poor? But they have time.

405
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,553
They have more time. That’s why they get…

406
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:25,647
enter into such things.

407
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:29,920
And they are going to finish this Mumbai of yours

408
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,223
very soon if you allow these people to go on strike.

409
01:13:32,423 --> 01:13:34,752
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity

410
01:13:34,986 --> 01:13:39,119
and it come from the western people - it’s not from Gandhiji.

411
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:43,245
Gandhiji didn’t tell you to fight for money. Did he?

412
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:46,077
He asked you to fight for swaatantrya.

413
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:47,977
And today if he was living,

414
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:51,477
he would have talked about Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of that.

415
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:54,946
But the problem that exists with us is that

416
01:13:55,147 --> 01:14:00,037
we don’t want to see that this machinery is now shaking.

417
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:02,131
We have to have another system,

418
01:14:02,295 --> 01:14:06,294
a parallel system that will crush this stupid machinery,

419
01:14:06,495 --> 01:14:10,424
which is taking us downward and downward and downward.

420
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,658
A girl must have ten types of sarees,

421
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:16,820
ten types of clothes she must wear, like a Kashmiri girl;

422
01:14:17,021 --> 01:14:18,312
she must wear like a Punjabi girl;

423
01:14:18,513 --> 01:14:20,351
she must wear like an English girl.

424
01:14:20,552 --> 01:14:22,929
What is the need? I mean, we used to have…

425
01:14:23,138 --> 01:14:24,859
we are rich people, I should… very rich,

426
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,145
we used to have only two sarees.

427
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:28,156
And one for - thevni as they call it -

428
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:31,431
one for some special occasions. And we lived well,

429
01:14:31,632 --> 01:14:34,796
we educated well where attention was learning

430
01:14:35,018 --> 01:14:37,655
and attention was towards God.

431
01:14:39,624 --> 01:14:42,957
But the attention, when it gets lost it fritters away.

432
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:44,845
It gets lost. It gets fragmented.

433
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,436
There’s no continuity in it. It fritters away

434
01:14:47,624 --> 01:14:50,079
and a person becomes a superficial person,

435
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,178
extremely superficial. He cannot go deep.

436
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:59,033
How can he feel his spirit? The superficiality makes you,

437
01:14:59,234 --> 01:15:04,731
absolutely, a person who has sort of a crust

438
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:10,718
and nothing inside, absolutely what we call the hollowness,

439
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:15,419
kokhlapan, completely hollow. If you just break that man,

440
01:15:15,638 --> 01:15:17,906
you find out he is not a man of character.

441
01:15:18,107 --> 01:15:20,090
He is not a man to be dependant upon.

442
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,395
He is not a man who talks good of others.

443
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:26,161
He will try to pull you down. This is what happens to your attention

444
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:33,522
and you become extremely, extremely low-level human being.

445
01:15:33,723 --> 01:15:37,082
You’ll be surprised I went to four villages before coming here

446
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:42,372
and the people who were there were five times more than Bombay people.

447
01:15:42,725 --> 01:15:44,905
They came, they didn’t have cars, nothing;

448
01:15:45,163 --> 01:15:50,118
they didn’t have buses. They came walking. They came on bullock carts.

449
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:54,793
And such a big crowd and all of them got realization

450
01:15:54,994 --> 01:15:58,594
because, thank God, they don’t know English language.

451
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:04,462
And these nonsensical ideas that we have got from the western culture.

452
01:16:04,947 --> 01:16:08,743
We are not to compete with them. They have to compete with us.

453
01:16:09,056 --> 01:16:11,189
They have nothing to offer you.

454
01:16:11,962 --> 01:16:15,033
You have to stick onto your ideal. But instead of that,

455
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:16,702
we have learnt all the bad things,

456
01:16:16,913 --> 01:16:19,506
and all the bad traditions like taking dowry,

457
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:23,268
torturing our women and doing all these things,

458
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:27,416
which do not at all look civil.

459
01:16:28,706 --> 01:16:31,620
In that we are not modern. In that we are not modern;

460
01:16:31,815 --> 01:16:35,317
in that we are very very primitive.

461
01:16:35,518 --> 01:16:38,949
But it was never so before. Nobody used to torture wives.

462
01:16:39,121 --> 01:16:42,160
We never knew there was a dowry system in India.

463
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:43,342
Nobody knew it.

464
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:45,902
It is absolutely something we cannot understand

465
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:49,699
from where it came, and I discovered it came from the English only.

466
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:53,461
Because they said we should be very,

467
01:16:53,662 --> 01:16:57,391
very balanced about our children.

468
01:16:57,592 --> 01:17:01,180
And we should not give only the money to the boy.

469
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:03,873
They’ll just quarrel but we should give it to the girl also.

470
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,568
Because, you see, the whole inheritance will go to the boys,

471
01:17:07,803 --> 01:17:10,208
the land will go to the boys, you must give some money.

472
01:17:10,409 --> 01:17:13,619
That was sensible but we have gone to the extremes now,

473
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,518
and all these problems are coming before us,

474
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,661
which we call as social problems.

475
01:17:19,862 --> 01:17:21,224
Then we have problems,

476
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:25,908
which we call as emotional problems out of family problems.

477
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:29,002
Now if you want to follow them

478
01:17:29,203 --> 01:17:30,788
then I would like to give you the picture

479
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:32,851
how their family lives are.

480
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:36,275
So that you’ll understand that you just stop

481
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:39,512
having all those ideas into your heads.

482
01:17:39,762 --> 01:17:43,163
The family picture is like this:

483
01:17:43,364 --> 01:17:48,429
That a husband and wife get married, so called.

484
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:53,626
Within say a year or so, they are divorced.

485
01:17:53,827 --> 01:17:59,331
Then in one lifetime they’ll have eight husbands and eight wives, at least.

486
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:03,386
Then they all land up in the orphanage in old age.

487
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:05,440
The children are in the orphanage.

488
01:18:05,684 --> 01:18:09,827
The father is in the orphanage and the mother is also in the orphanage.

489
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:13,434
All the mothers, fathers, everybody ends up in orphanage.

490
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:20,592
There is no love. There is no feeling in England itself,

491
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:24,300
I was feeling, but it is only in London.

492
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,343
Two children are killed by their parents.

493
01:18:28,544 --> 01:18:32,054
There’s no compassion. There’s no daya.

494
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:33,599
There’s no karuna in them.

495
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:37,007
And that’s what today happening to us also.

496
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,005
Our children are going the same way.

497
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:41,663
Our parents are going the same way.

498
01:18:41,912 --> 01:18:45,724
So as My mother always used to say, “lakshya kuthe?”

499
01:18:45,925 --> 01:18:49,221
where’s your attention? Where is your attention?

500
01:18:49,956 --> 01:18:52,534
So you would say that no, my attention is nowhere.

501
01:18:52,722 --> 01:18:55,018
Nowhere means what? Should be on God.

502
01:18:55,245 --> 01:18:59,520
Where is your attention? Should be on God.

503
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:02,434
Devaa kade lakshya thevaa. Keep attention towards God.

504
01:19:02,635 --> 01:19:04,446
Where is your attention?

505
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:06,611
Even when they taught music they used to say,

506
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:11,653
“first think of God.” Anything they did, think of God.

507
01:19:11,854 --> 01:19:13,653
When you think of God,

508
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:18,856
you don’t think of other nonsensical things but sensible things.

509
01:19:19,057 --> 01:19:21,866
And that is how our… our attention frittered away

510
01:19:22,067 --> 01:19:23,998
because when the attention comes out

511
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:33,511
it attacks the modern, because there’s a challenge.

512
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:37,543
As a result of that fight the attention breaks into fragments.

513
01:19:37,744 --> 01:19:39,566
There is no... Fragmentation is there.

514
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:41,027
Your attention is not collected.

515
01:19:41,228 --> 01:19:43,033
You don’t know where you are, where you are moving.

516
01:19:43,234 --> 01:19:44,933
You can’t see anything; you don’t understand.

517
01:19:45,134 --> 01:19:46,924
You ask them one question, they don’t know.

518
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,704
They’ve forgotten. What is your father’s name?

519
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:51,678
“No, I don’t know what’s my father’s name”.

520
01:19:54,593 --> 01:19:57,923
This is the situation, which they are facing.

521
01:19:58,124 --> 01:20:03,483
You have no idea as to what hell they are living into.

522
01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:08,907
And if you want to take yourself and your children to that hell, follow them.

523
01:20:10,775 --> 01:20:13,563
But it doesn’t mean that you go to these bhajjis

524
01:20:13,778 --> 01:20:16,191
and give them money, or go to these horrible gurus.

525
01:20:16,392 --> 01:20:21,035
It doesn’t mean that either. It never means that.

526
01:20:21,236 --> 01:20:22,410
You avoid that nonsense

527
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:25,165
because your parents were stupid to go to these gurus.

528
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,743
These have started only hundred years back.

529
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:29,298
We have never known such people.

530
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:30,899
Before, these bhondoos we never knew.

531
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:33,767
Hundred years back nobody talks except for Nanaka,

532
01:20:33,986 --> 01:20:36,283
who has said it that these bhondoos must be avoided.

533
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:38,783
“Sadguru che lakshan he” and all these things

534
01:20:38,984 --> 01:20:43,111
have been written by Ramdaasa. But who reads Ramdaas?

535
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:45,556
Because he was a Brahmin, non-Brahmins won’t read.

536
01:20:45,757 --> 01:20:47,913
Who will read Tukharaama? Because he was a non-Brahmin,

537
01:20:48,114 --> 01:20:52,978
Brahmins won’t read it. If their caste is such a big thing,

538
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:56,932
that by reading something it falls off, better give it up.

539
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,799
All these caste systems

540
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:02,255
and all these are now so much settled into our heads.

541
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:04,925
So much settled; it was never so before.

542
01:21:05,245 --> 01:21:07,615
It’s very surprising.

543
01:21:07,816 --> 01:21:10,682
And in the early times there was no caste system.

544
01:21:10,925 --> 01:21:13,412
There was a caste system according to your karmas,

545
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:17,369
according to your doings, not according to where you are born.

546
01:21:17,577 --> 01:21:21,725
Otherwise, how could Valmiki be called a brahma rishi?

547
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,083
And how could Vyasa, who was an illegitimate child

548
01:21:26,284 --> 01:21:31,351
of a fisherwoman, could be called as the greatest of greatest?

549
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:37,283
All these false ideas have to fall out,

550
01:21:37,484 --> 01:21:40,007
and for that we have to start a new system.

551
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,502
And a new system has to come forward through the people

552
01:21:43,703 --> 01:21:46,213
who have achieved their yoga.

553
01:21:46,414 --> 01:21:48,510
Shri Krishna Himself has clearly said,

554
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:51,624
“yogakshema vahamyaham” - when you get your yoga,

555
01:21:51,805 --> 01:21:56,065
you will get kshema. Always He has said about yogis.

556
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:58,575
He has used the word yogis for that.

557
01:21:58,755 --> 01:22:00,528
These yogis have to come that,

558
01:22:00,729 --> 01:22:02,395
and as you have read in the Pasaydaan just now

559
01:22:02,596 --> 01:22:06,830
you have heard about it that the forests,

560
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:13,778
forests of these great people who are kalpatarus,

561
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:18,411
who are the givers of your desires, will be walking.

562
01:22:18,612 --> 01:22:21,159
These are the yogis.

563
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:26,479
And the oceans of this talking nectar

564
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:32,984
will be talking about God. These are the yogis.

565
01:22:33,185 --> 01:22:35,474
Others are all ordinary useless people,

566
01:22:35,675 --> 01:22:37,229
will be frittered away.

567
01:22:37,464 --> 01:22:40,504
Only the yogis will be respected in the kingdom of God.

568
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:43,573
And we have to bring the kingdom of God on this earth.

569
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:48,587
First in India, then everywhere. Here it is going to come.

570
01:22:48,788 --> 01:22:54,897
Now people might say Marxism, this ism, that ism.

571
01:22:55,741 --> 01:23:02,507
Tukaraama has said ava ghaachi samsaara sukha cha kari.

572
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:05,793
He said it. Same - Marx says the same.

573
01:23:05,994 --> 01:23:08,212
He says that the whole world should be so…

574
01:23:08,408 --> 01:23:11,590
such a happy place, such a happy place

575
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:15,591
that there should be no state.

576
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:20,978
How? Nobody asked him how. He talks of evolution. How?

577
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:23,878
How the evolution is going to take place? Ask him.

578
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:25,612
Ask all these communists.

579
01:23:25,808 --> 01:23:28,339
They are not becoming better people. Are they?

580
01:23:28,558 --> 01:23:30,158
Who is becoming better?

581
01:23:30,425 --> 01:23:33,706
Who is getting transformed by that Isms? None of them.

582
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,870
Somebody is a disciple of this gentleman.

583
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:37,644
Somebody is a disciple of that gentleman.

584
01:23:37,883 --> 01:23:40,910
Somebody is following this kind of a political theory.

585
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:43,853
Another following that kind of a theory. It’s a theory.

586
01:23:44,054 --> 01:23:47,446
In Marathi as they say, “bhola cha tsa baata bhola chi tsa kari”.

587
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:48,743
Whatever theories you have,

588
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:50,279
you have written down on your heads.

589
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:54,220
Are you going to get transformation with that?

590
01:23:54,421 --> 01:23:57,358
There has to, something, happen within you.

591
01:23:57,553 --> 01:24:01,196
If you have to get to that point what Marx has said,

592
01:24:01,397 --> 01:24:03,556
what Tukaraama has said.

593
01:24:03,757 --> 01:24:07,853
This parivarthan, this change, this transformation has to take place

594
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,947
and that’s only possible through the Kundalini awakening.

595
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,431
There are people who have read about Kundalini.

596
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:15,650
They come and ask Me,

597
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,142
“Mother this Kundalini that You are talking about,

598
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:20,330
people say that this Kundalini can give us madness, this that.”

599
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:24,877
Even they have said that six,

600
01:24:25,078 --> 01:24:28,484
sixth chapter of Gynaneshwari should not be read at all

601
01:24:28,711 --> 01:24:30,679
7because it deals with Kundalini.

602
01:24:30,883 --> 01:24:32,730
Naturally - because they don’t know anything about it.

603
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:34,910
So it is better not to deal with it.

604
01:24:35,129 --> 01:24:40,131
But Kundalini is the shuddha iccha, is the real icchaa,

605
01:24:40,332 --> 01:24:42,270
is the one that is going to give you

606
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:45,220
that what you are born for, is going to give you.

607
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:49,903
After that you do not want anything else.

608
01:24:50,104 --> 01:24:53,209
It’s not like the economics that you want today this,

609
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:57,326
tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general.

610
01:24:57,527 --> 01:25:00,482
It gets completely…

611
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:06,836
the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction.

612
01:25:07,037 --> 01:25:09,602
But is the movement is upward;

613
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:13,367
the Kundalini doesn’t go downward towards the gravity,

614
01:25:13,579 --> 01:25:16,063
towards the matter.

615
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:23,964
It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this

616
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:28,190
fontanelle bone area and you get your self-realization.

617
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:31,167
This is what you should ask from any guru.

618
01:25:31,368 --> 01:25:34,258
All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it?

619
01:25:34,454 --> 01:25:37,612
Can you show rupee to that Kundalini?

620
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:41,159
It’s a living process of the living evolution,

621
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,360
which has to take place.

622
01:25:42,548 --> 01:25:46,148
You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this.

623
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:47,706
How are you going to do it?

624
01:25:47,907 --> 01:25:50,953
Are you going to do it by standing on your head?

625
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:53,631
Any living process like a sprouting of a seed,

626
01:25:53,832 --> 01:25:56,740
how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth.

627
01:25:56,941 --> 01:26:00,475
And She has the power and She just sprouts it.

628
01:26:00,676 --> 01:26:03,636
In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout.

629
01:26:03,849 --> 01:26:08,490
In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously.

630
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:11,758
Sahaj. Saha – with, ja - born.

631
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:17,419
This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birthright.

632
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:21,117
Get it, and for Indians it’s a special blessing

633
01:26:21,318 --> 01:26:24,220
that they get it very fast. Just like their independence,

634
01:26:24,421 --> 01:26:27,421
without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say.

635
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:29,710
Others have struggled much more than us.

636
01:26:29,928 --> 01:26:34,634
When you get that you also loose it very fast.

637
01:26:34,835 --> 01:26:39,826
So those people who understand Kundalini

638
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:42,636
understand the essence of everything

639
01:26:42,832 --> 01:26:48,006
and they understand that all the religions are on one essence.

640
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:51,485
They are the flowers of the same tree.

641
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:53,629
Stupidly we are fighting here.

642
01:26:53,830 --> 01:27:00,446
Christ has said those who are not against us are with us.

643
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:03,094
Who are those? Christians don’t want to find out.

644
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:06,216
Now they are after Christ’s life.

645
01:27:06,443 --> 01:27:08,843
Hindus don’t want to know about it.

646
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:12,378
There is no greatness of art. I would say now,

647
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:17,875
there was a problem in Aurangabad and the people attacked.

648
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:19,883
They should not have attacked. All right.

649
01:27:20,055 --> 01:27:23,722
But we have to understand what has happened in this one,

650
01:27:23,923 --> 01:27:27,722
where we have gone wrong. We should see our mistake.

651
01:27:27,923 --> 01:27:31,297
In a masjid, whatever it is, it’s a God place.

652
01:27:31,532 --> 01:27:35,195
It’s a God’s place, and in a masjid if they are meditating,

653
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,801
you should not make noise. If you are insulting that,

654
01:27:39,002 --> 01:27:41,822
you are insulting Vittala Himself.

655
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:45,887
In the Vittala mandir you have a different type of aarti,

656
01:27:46,088 --> 01:27:49,734
all right, have it. In that aarti if somebody starts

657
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:55,195
doing discotheque dance, how will you like it?

658
01:27:56,926 --> 01:28:00,059
In the same way if that is a place of ibaadat,

659
01:28:00,312 --> 01:28:03,697
is a place where people are praying in a dhyana.

660
01:28:03,898 --> 01:28:06,991
Just now we are so quiet, we are sitting in the

661
01:28:07,202 --> 01:28:13,741
surrounding horrible noises, but everything is quiet.

662
01:28:13,942 --> 01:28:15,390
That’s why we are enjoying.

663
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:19,743
And if that is the way they want to meditate,

664
01:28:19,944 --> 01:28:21,955
must we go and disturb them

665
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:25,181
for something that some boys are troubling and all that?

666
01:28:25,354 --> 01:28:28,287
Can’t we respect it? To show our greatness,

667
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,634
khorpana, must we do that?

668
01:28:31,835 --> 01:28:34,327
Is it very important that at that time

669
01:28:34,528 --> 01:28:39,434
we should take these besura, betaala bands in front of that?

670
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:47,407
Why don’t we see that we also must respect

671
01:28:47,608 --> 01:28:50,118
whatever is God, everywhere?

672
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:51,935
This is the mistake we commit.

673
01:28:52,136 --> 01:28:55,474
In the name of religion we insult God Himself.

674
01:28:55,683 --> 01:28:58,349
When they say “Allah-O-Akbar”, they mean Virat,

675
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:01,057
means Shri Krishna Itself. If you come to Sahaja yoga,

676
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,237
you will know that they are all related to each other.

677
01:29:03,433 --> 01:29:06,833
That Mohammed Sahib was nothing (but) a maha medha.

678
01:29:07,606 --> 01:29:12,089
He was the Dattatreya Himself. This is the medha,

679
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:14,891
and He is settled down there.

680
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:18,196
I know He was given poison and He was tortured.

681
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,871
And the same thing - when we do it by saying

682
01:29:22,072 --> 01:29:24,415
that Mohammed was wrong. He was not wrong.

683
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:26,871
Who was wrong? Are the Muslims. Who was wrong?

684
01:29:27,072 --> 01:29:29,470
Is the Hindus. Who was wrong? Are the Christians.

685
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:31,665
They are all against all these prophets,

686
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:35,988
all these great incarnations and bringing bad name to them.

687
01:29:36,189 --> 01:29:41,353
Let us start understanding. Let us start respecting.

688
01:29:41,554 --> 01:29:45,592
Let us be great. Let us be noble.

689
01:29:45,818 --> 01:29:50,068
Let us be higher people of affection,

690
01:29:50,287 --> 01:29:53,412
compassion and understanding. Let us be those people.

691
01:29:53,615 --> 01:29:56,577
Let us start. Let us start a nucleus like that.

692
01:29:56,778 --> 01:29:58,357
If you can do it, we can

693
01:29:58,558 --> 01:30:02,000
make all those who have gone down also

694
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,710
pull back all of them upward.

695
01:30:05,335 --> 01:30:08,073
It was built in this country - this system.

696
01:30:08,222 --> 01:30:12,529
Whole thing was built in this country that we should ascend.

697
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:14,917
Very beautifully done longtime back

698
01:30:15,113 --> 01:30:19,474
but was lost in the deluge of modern life.

699
01:30:19,675 --> 01:30:23,336
So people should take to all the traditional things,

700
01:30:23,514 --> 01:30:26,000
which are beautiful, all the traditional games

701
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:31,706
that are beautiful, all the traditions that give respect.

702
01:30:31,907 --> 01:30:33,585
If you loose the sense of respect,

703
01:30:33,786 --> 01:30:37,848
you have lost the humanity, absolutely hundred percent.

704
01:30:38,075 --> 01:30:39,739
If you do not know how to respect,

705
01:30:39,926 --> 01:30:42,624
you are not an Indian at all. You are not an Indian.

706
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:47,744
Don’t call yourself an Indian. You must learn how to respect.

707
01:30:47,945 --> 01:30:51,774
Respect gives you greatness. It makes you humble

708
01:30:51,982 --> 01:30:56,922
like Tukharaama said,

709
01:30:57,123 --> 01:31:02,370
“anurenu uni thodkaa, tukha aakaashaye vadaa”.

710
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:04,620
When he becomes smaller than anurenu

711
01:31:04,846 --> 01:31:07,974
then he becomes aakaashaye vadaa.

712
01:31:08,175 --> 01:31:11,724
In the vadaat tree the seed is so very small,

713
01:31:11,912 --> 01:31:14,216
if you see that, it’s a extremely small

714
01:31:14,423 --> 01:31:16,623
and the biggest tree it creates.

715
01:31:17,193 --> 01:31:21,460
Once Shastriji said that even the small thing can do great job.

716
01:31:21,695 --> 01:31:24,822
And that’s what we are seeing. That a small thing,

717
01:31:25,023 --> 01:31:26,968
only when you become humble,

718
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:30,023
then the grace of God surrounds your humility,

719
01:31:30,224 --> 01:31:32,972
surrounds your personality. And you become

720
01:31:33,173 --> 01:31:38,129
really a personality that has authority of God.

721
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:42,025
That is the greatness of God - in that humility it works,

722
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:43,465
it just works.

723
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:47,286
After realization, the attention becomes enlightened.

724
01:31:47,489 --> 01:31:50,767
By that attention, looking at people

725
01:31:50,968 --> 01:31:52,296
you can raise their Kundalini.

726
01:31:52,497 --> 01:31:55,356
Only looking at people you can cure them.

727
01:31:55,575 --> 01:31:58,395
All your powers are expressed in your attention

728
01:31:58,614 --> 01:32:01,773
and you don’t get lost in the matter.

729
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,817
Then you become the Baadshah.

730
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,702
Baadshah is a person who doesn’t mind anything;

731
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:10,624
he doesn’t need anything.

732
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:14,296
As you know, I am born in a rich family and

733
01:32:14,421 --> 01:32:18,947
My in-laws are also rich. My husband is rich and all that,

734
01:32:19,148 --> 01:32:21,632
but I can live there, I can sleep there.

735
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:24,155
I have lived in the jungles. I have lived along the rivers.

736
01:32:24,356 --> 01:32:28,132
I have no problem because - why do I want anything?

737
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,672
Nothing can dominate Me. You can sleep on the stones.

738
01:32:30,873 --> 01:32:31,896
You can do what you like.

739
01:32:32,068 --> 01:32:35,177
But that’s only possible when you become the yogi.

740
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:37,177
When you become the yogi, you can do it.

741
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:39,544
These four hundred people, who have come from abroad,

742
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:42,083
come from very rich families, very good families.

743
01:32:42,284 --> 01:32:44,688
And they have got all the comforts that you can think of,

744
01:32:44,889 --> 01:32:49,378
but they want to live under the sky, near the river.

745
01:32:49,636 --> 01:32:53,292
They just don’t want to see the cement on top of their heads.

746
01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:57,532
They are so much, now, in the higher level

747
01:32:57,733 --> 01:33:00,256
that they don’t want to see anything that is gross.

748
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:03,597
They want this mud.

749
01:33:03,786 --> 01:33:08,912
They want this beautiful clay of this country.

750
01:33:09,113 --> 01:33:13,365
Kya deshachi maati bokha lagait. Tithe baslaat tumhi.

751
01:33:13,607 --> 01:33:17,340
You are sitting on top of that; and what are you doing?

752
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:24,485
Your attention, where is it? Where is your attention?

753
01:33:24,686 --> 01:33:28,279
You must keep your attention to God;

754
01:33:28,475 --> 01:33:31,719
and once that is there, you’ll become a yogi.

755
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,571
And once you become the yogi,

756
01:33:34,772 --> 01:33:41,443
you will be in the realm of God, in the kingdom of heaven.

757
01:33:41,644 --> 01:33:43,436
When you’ll be blessed with everything

758
01:33:43,637 --> 01:33:45,910
you don’t have to desire. It will just before,

759
01:33:46,111 --> 01:33:50,418
you will not know how to contain all that God has given you,

760
01:33:50,619 --> 01:33:53,095
the kshema that He gives you. Apart from that,

761
01:33:53,275 --> 01:33:57,660
your attention itself will be such a powerful

762
01:33:57,861 --> 01:34:01,578
instrument that you can change the entire universe with that.

763
01:34:01,778 --> 01:34:04,711
Why I beg of you? - Because you are Indians.

764
01:34:05,004 --> 01:34:07,835
You are born in this country because of poorva sukrutaas,

765
01:34:08,062 --> 01:34:10,795
because what you have done in last life.

766
01:34:11,054 --> 01:34:13,859
That’s why you are born in this great country.

767
01:34:14,078 --> 01:34:17,945
But it’s like those who have teeth don’t have the chanas to eat,

768
01:34:18,146 --> 01:34:21,536
and those who don’t have teeth have got the chanas.

769
01:34:21,737 --> 01:34:24,604
It’s like that. The situation is very bad.

770
01:34:24,885 --> 01:34:27,252
You are the ones who can become the greatest yogis,

771
01:34:27,464 --> 01:34:29,585
but you do not. But the western people

772
01:34:29,786 --> 01:34:33,395
who do not have any idea about holiness,

773
01:34:33,596 --> 01:34:37,051
about auspiciousness, nothing they are so ignorant

774
01:34:37,263 --> 01:34:41,210
they shoot off much faster than you can.

775
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:44,572
So I have to make a humble request to you that

776
01:34:44,753 --> 01:34:51,661
do not get enamored by this attention that goes to any matter.

777
01:34:51,862 --> 01:34:55,672
But matter itself is made by God.

778
01:34:56,954 --> 01:35:00,391
So despite the fact human beings got involved

779
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:02,662
into the material advancement,

780
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:06,539
it is today helping us in Sahaja yoga in a very great way.

781
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:11,135
For example, this mic is important,

782
01:35:11,336 --> 01:35:13,635
is also useful for carrying My vibrations.

783
01:35:13,836 --> 01:35:18,619
It carries vibrations. Camera shows all the light around Me

784
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:21,769
and shows all the kinds of forms I have.

785
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:24,550
So whatever you may try,

786
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:28,266
the Divine will sparkle through that matter also

787
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:32,532
and will establish the existence of Divinity.

788
01:35:33,642 --> 01:35:37,667
But if you cut out the Divinity out of the matter,

789
01:35:37,868 --> 01:35:41,809
you will be hit hard and you’ll be submerged

790
01:35:42,004 --> 01:35:46,199
in the greater ocean of ignorance and filth.

791
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:51,586
So keep Divinity at your heart and then deal with matter.

792
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:55,646
And then you will understand what is the use of this matter,

793
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:57,862
and what one has to do with it.

794
01:35:58,099 --> 01:36:02,147
Tomorrow, in Hindi, I will be talking about the rest of it

795
01:36:02,348 --> 01:36:10,155
about the truth because today I’ve talked about the Chit.

796
01:36:10,343 --> 01:36:12,108
Tomorrow I’ll be talking about the truth.

797
01:36:12,281 --> 01:36:16,095
Sat-Chit-Anand. And third day I’ll be talking

798
01:36:16,296 --> 01:36:19,098
about Anand to you in Marathi language.

799
01:36:19,317 --> 01:36:25,413
I hope you will sit down and meditate on what I have said.

800
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:28,959
I do not want to condemn any culture as such.

801
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,445
But I want to protect you from what has happened

802
01:36:32,646 --> 01:36:35,542
to that culture and where it has gone,

803
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:40,795
to bring you back to your own great culture,

804
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:43,507
which came to us in thousands of years.

805
01:36:43,718 --> 01:36:46,986
Their culture is very, very, very new,

806
01:36:47,187 --> 01:36:49,133
it’s very new and one day they will also have

807
01:36:49,334 --> 01:36:51,267
the same culture as we have.

808
01:36:51,584 --> 01:36:54,037
But why not we short circuit it

809
01:36:54,311 --> 01:36:57,594
and adjust ourselves to this great culture,

810
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:05,607
which is so much God oriented, not money oriented,

811
01:37:05,772 --> 01:37:09,642
ego oriented but God oriented?

812
01:37:09,843 --> 01:37:16,119
Let us all attain that state of yogi.

813
01:37:16,347 --> 01:37:18,791
I hope today it will happen to all of you

814
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:21,708
and that you’ll all get your realization.

815
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:23,471
May God bless you.
