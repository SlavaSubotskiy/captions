1
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:19,184
Today is an important day in the northern part of the world

2
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:21,311
 because the Sun travels from South to North

3
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:25,428
not because we do it every year on the same day

4
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:28,864
because the Sun (UNCLEAR)

5
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:33,915
Why do we give so much importance to it?

6
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:39,902
         What is the special reason that if the Sun comes to the North

7
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:43,787
 why does it give us such happiness?

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,516
The point is that with the help of the Sun only

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,863
 all our work gets sanctified.

10
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:58,868
When there is no light during night, we are asleep.

11
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:06,646
But when the sun rises, after that only all our work starts.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,990
So, that which influences this work is the Sun.

13
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:24,436
And that because it comes within our domain

14
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:30,439
so, we respect it too much.

15
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:33,895
The greatest thing is that

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,742
rest of the festivals are observed on the basis of the Moon.

17
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:45,271
And this is the only  festival that we observe

18
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,781
on the basis of the Sun.

19
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:54,630
In this way, in our country Surya Narayan has much reverence.

20
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,963
And people give much importance to Surya Narayan

21
00:01:57,988 --> 00:02:01,248
and go to Gangaji to take their bath

22
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:05,849
and perform many types of rituals.

23
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:11,054
But the most important of all is, this day.

24
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:20,136
Now we have to decide, what should we do on this day?

25
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:24,850
On this special day what work should we do?

26
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,607
Offer Namaskar to Surya (Sun), offer water to Surya

27
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:36,287
and express our gratitude towards Surya.

28
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:39,872
But the question is what in particular can we do?

29
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:44,273
Particularly what can Sahajyogis do?

30
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:49,473
You know that on Agnya Chakra Sun has its seat

31
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:54,984
and at Agnya Chakra you think about everything.

32
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:59,494
So it is very important to correct our Agnya Chakra

33
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:04,571
because it influences the Sun.

34
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:10,638
So for this, the importance of Agnya is that

35
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:16,752
according to the planet on our Agnya

36
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,285
we get angry with the people because of our Agnya chakra.

37
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:28,235
and our relation with them gets disturbed.

38
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:36,072
We get angry and we give up every type of belief.

39
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,247
Agnya is a very important area.

40
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:45,385
We should understand that it is the abode of Christ.

41
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:51,089
But Christ told only one thing that we should forgive everyone.

42
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,396
It is very important to forgive.

43
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:59,813
Now how to do that, many people say i have done

44
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:00,915
but it doesn't work.

45
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:06,331
To forgive it is important to have satisfaction from inside.

46
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,488
And one should think that whatever he had said he will pay for that.

47
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:12,366
What we have to do with that?

48
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:16,636
Whatever anyone had said  (Not Clear)

49
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,933
Why should you interfere in this.

50
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,539
In this way it is cheapish

51
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:26,266
and you forgive everyone, your Agnya Chakra will be alright.

52
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:29,912
The greatest problem in our Agnya chakra

53
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:37,184
which blocks our ascent, whick blocks our kundalini

54
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:43,549
is our Agnya and for that we must know how to forgive.

55
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,217
Everytime we go on thinking

56
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,900
what was the misery he caused, what was the mistake?

57
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:52,633
Instead we should think that we should forgive

58
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,227
We have forgiven him.

59
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,348
By forgiving you will be absolutely surprised

60
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:01,629
that this Kundalini will move up in no time.

61
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,770
We have to raise our own Kundalini

62
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:08,921
and for that it is necessary for us to keep our Agnya clear

63
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,138
It is man's nature to get angry.

64
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:15,363
it is not God's, it is  man's nature.

65
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:18,144
So anger should be avoided.

66
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:22,845
as against that you should say forgive, forgive, forgive

67
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,430
Saying so many times, your Agnya Chakra will be clear.

68
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,164
Blessings to all of you!
