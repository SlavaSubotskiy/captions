1
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:24,833
Now, as you know that United States
or America,

2
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:29,675
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

3
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:37,345
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi chakra.

4
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:45,138
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi
chakra is United States.

5
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:51,724
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is governed by Shri Krishna.

6
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:55,498
And His power is Radha.

7
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,530
“RA – DHA”. “RA” means energy, “DHA” is
the one who has sustained the energy.

8
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:06,111
“RA – DHA”. “dha-re-ti-saa”.

9
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:11,144
So, she’s the one who has sustained
the energy,

10
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:16,814
and so, she’s called as Radha. She’s
the power of Shri Krishna.

11
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,899
The word Krishna comes from the word –
Krishi, means –

12
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,914
the ploughing, or you can say, agriculture
is called as “Krishi”.

13
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:36,303
The one who ploughs and puts the seed
in the soil, is doing the krishi.

14
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:40,396
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:51,104
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

16
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:54,887
It is Shri Krishna who said, in Sanskrit –

17
00:01:55,088 --> 00:01:59,224
“Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah

18
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:04,801
na chainam kledayanty apo
na shoshayati marutah”

19
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,941
meaning – it cannot be, means,
the spiritual life

20
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:13,513
or you can say, the eternal life, or
the Spirit,

21
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:18,766
cannot be killed by anything, by any
weapon,

22
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:22,150
neither can be blown away by air,

23
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:27,432
nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be
destroyed.

24
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,643
So, to prove that, Christ came on this
earth,

25
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:36,595
and through His resurrection he proved,
what Shri Krishna has said.

26
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,661
And most of you sahaj yogis know
the relationship

27
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:43,032
of Christ and Shri Krishna – why he was
called Christ.

28
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:47,150
Christ word comes from the same – Krishna.

29
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:52,356
And, his first name comes from the word
Yashoda.

30
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:55,495
Yashoda is also called as Jesu or Yesu.

31
00:02:55,696 --> 00:03:05,053
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

32
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:08,169
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu,

33
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,579
because of Yashoda (the mother), the foster
mother of Shri Krishna.

34
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:18,358
Also, you know that Radha was the same
as Mahalakshmi,

35
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:26,214
so she was the same as the mother
of Christ, Mary.

36
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,438
These, all these things we can prove it
in Sahaj Yoga.

37
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,751
Because, when the Kundalini moves up
to the Vishuddhi chakra,

38
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:38,169
and if it stops there, you can ask
the question –

39
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,983
Was Jesus the son of mother Mary?

40
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:50,524
Who was the son of Ra, was the same
as Radha?”

41
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,490
And then the Kundalini moves.

42
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:58,123
So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which
proves what has been said so far.

43
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:02,433
It proves. It’s not just a cock and bull
story.

44
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,504
Because people do not believe into all
these things.

45
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,148
They think that it’s all cock and bull
story. Who was Christ?

46
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,741
Who was Krishna? Who was Radha? After all,
there was no God.

47
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:18,478
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can
prove it, that what we say is the truth.

48
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:24,010
Because, as through realisation, you get
connected to the mains,

49
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:28,423
your vibrations start flowing,

50
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:31,521
like the computer, you start working.

51
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,151
And whatever question you ask,

52
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:37,054
answer comes to you as tremendous
vibrations,

53
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:40,936
or it stops or you might get heat or you
may get blisters.

54
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:47,755
So, the whole message is communicated
to you through your fingertips.

55
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:54,443
(...) Now Vishuddhi chakra was created
on the Saturday.

56
00:04:54,644 --> 00:05:00,291
So, it is the Saturn – that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

57
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,089
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,

58
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,623
America will be in a better place to do
things.

59
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:13,289
But I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

60
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,199
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth,

61
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,040
what is their work, what they are supposed
to do,

62
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:24,190
or what is the purpose of God of creating
America.

63
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:30,270
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra
within us was that,

64
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,994
when we became human beings, we raised
our heads up like that.

65
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:37,903
When you raised your head up like that,

66
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:42,247
you have become a human being, in the sense
that now,

67
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:45,417
there is a new movement in your
consciousness.

68
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:51,867
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back

69
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:55,016
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

70
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:59,147
That the new movement was, that it is
the Father.

71
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:04,314
The advent of the Father was celebrated,
and that’s how

72
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:12,488
people developed a kind of a new instrument
within themselves, called ego.

73
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,777
When the brain was lifted like this
you see,

74
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:21,790
it expanded in a pyramidical – it’s
a pyramid – it became a pyramid.

75
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:26,295
In an animal, the brain is flat. And,
gradually it rises.

76
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,359
When the head was raised, when
the responsibility was taken

77
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:32,468
of raising the head, the brain started
growing

78
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,980
in such a way that it became a pyramid.
And when it became a pyramid,

79
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:43,414
he attention became a different attention
from that of animal.

80
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:47,938
Because, when the waves of your
consciousness

81
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:54,490
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went
into the parallelogram of forces,

82
00:06:54,691 --> 00:07:00,370
by which the resultant force –
the resultant force…

83
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:05,593
Now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that –

84
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:10,334
had two sides – one was this, another
was this.

85
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:13,512
So, the consciousness, or we can say,
the attention –

86
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,985
instead of going inside, started going
outward.

87
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,147
So, one part of the resultant was going
outside

88
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:26,746
and that’s how, when you became a human
being, your attention went outside.

89
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:31,508
Are the human beings only, who have their
attention outside.

90
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:33,574
Not that the animals don’t have,

91
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:40,207
but the attention of human beings are such
that they create reactions.

92
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:44,124
Like, you see something.

93
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:47,532
Now, I see Doctor’s house say for example,

94
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:52,433
then a reaction starts in my mind – what is
this, what does this mean,

95
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:56,367
how much it must have cost, from where
did he buy it!

96
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,386
Anything you see, it starts giving you
a reaction.

97
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,476
Not to the animals. Animals, at the most
they will say –

98
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:06,568
this I must eat, that I must eat, that
I must get.

99
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:09,650
But, they do not think about it.

100
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:12,781
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

101
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:20,273
And this reflection comes because of the
pyramid-like structure of the brain.

102
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:25,939
And this has a special reaction in
the brain itself,

103
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:30,188
that we start developing our own ego,

104
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,946
our own myths, our own mental projections.

105
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,394
And when we develop our own mental
projections,

106
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:40,985
this ego starts developing, “I know”
“what’s wrong”,

107
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,226
all these nonsensical things come.

108
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:48,072
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

109
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:51,687
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us,

110
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,889
is of the superego – as an animal.

111
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,547
And then, comes up in the centre.

112
00:08:56,748 --> 00:09:01,206
That’s how we now become normal human
beings.

113
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,417
But then we start increasing our ego.

114
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:10,669
It starts overlapping the superego,

115
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,087
and a calcification takes place, by which
we develop our I-ness.

116
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:23,613
So, it is all the happening that takes
place after we have lifted our head,

117
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:28,210
raised our head, and we are no more
like animals.

118
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,764
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part
to play

119
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:38,147
in the human evolution, that by developing
your Vishuddhi chakra,

120
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:43,138
you have become human beings, first of all.

121
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,217
Secondly, because it is the chakra
of the Father,

122
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:57,719
who becomes again, the primordial – as you
call it in…,

123
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:07,036
macrocosm. You become the macrocosm.

124
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:13,227
You are the microcosm, and the Father
is the macrocosm.

125
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:17,564
So, you become that because of
the Vishuddhi chakra,

126
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:19,987
which is governed by Shri Krishna,

127
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:24,262
who becomes that macrocosm, called
as Virat.

128
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:30,586
In the brain it is expressed in this part.
In this part of the head.

129
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:35,386
It is here that you start manifesting

130
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:41,580
your macrocosm qualities – at this point.

131
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,919
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has
a speciality – is that,

132
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,507
we always say that the responsibility
on my shoulders.

133
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,242
Always we say that – the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

134
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:58,424
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

135
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:03,053
And that’s why you know, the Americans
feel responsible for the whole world.

136
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,862
Naturally!

137
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:11,486
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

138
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:18,869
But how much they are aware of their role

139
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,640
as the responsible people, that’s
a different point.

140
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,770
But they feel they are responsible,

141
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:30,426
but their role, as responsible people,
if they understand,

142
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:34,956
then they have to be ideals. Ideals.

143
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:38,817
Because a person who is a responsible
person in a family,

144
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:41,597
has to be the ideal for others.

145
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,710
It started very well, I should say,

146
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,301
at the time of Abraham Lincoln. It started
very well.

147
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:50,456
When you started talking about democracy,
is also –

148
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:53,538
democracy is nothing but collectivity.

149
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:58,902
He started talking about collectivity
of the people, by the people.

150
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,827
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

151
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:06,271
started coming right in this Vishuddhi
chakra.

152
00:12:06,514 --> 00:12:09,841
(...) Specially for America, I’m wearing
this stone

153
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:12,376
which is called as the black sapphire.

154
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:17,451
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

155
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:20,042
Every chakra has a stone.

156
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,137
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi
chakra,

157
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:26,388
so I’m wearing this, just for coming
to America.

158
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:39,694
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country

159
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:46,984
by exciting the deities, Shri Krishna
himself, who is in charge.

160
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:52,820
By pleasing him. By making him active.
