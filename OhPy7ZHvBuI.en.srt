1
00:09:55,015 --> 00:10:01,375
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

2
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:05,345
He's created this whole thing.

3
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:09,305
The whole atmosphere is there.

4
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:13,904
The whole feeling is there of love.

5
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:21,525
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

6
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:27,695
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

7
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:32,524
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

8
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:38,085
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

9
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:45,895
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

10
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:52,614
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

11
00:10:52,614 --> 00:11:01,285
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

12
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,965
of violence since long.

13
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:15,635
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

14
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:16,735
take place.

15
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,635
There has to be complete peace.

16
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:26,985
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

17
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,855
beautiful nation.

18
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:45,155
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

19
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:52,955
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

20
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,925
He gives peace.

21
00:11:55,925 --> 00:12:02,324
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

22
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:05,345
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

23
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:08,495
You all have got your Realization.

24
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:16,565
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

25
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:23,685
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

26
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:26,194
You will create peace.

27
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:35,875
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

28
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:46,375
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

29
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:50,634
peace to others and become examples of it.

30
00:12:50,634 --> 00:13:00,205
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

31
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,565
I never expected.

32
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:16,205
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

33
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:25,345
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

34
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,345
I have faced all that.

35
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:34,444
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

36
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:48,015
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

37
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:50,985
this depth you have to develop.

38
00:13:50,985 --> 00:14:01,634
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

39
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:11,925
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

40
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,485
for you to do anything extra.

41
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:21,265
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

42
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,255
Just feel it.

43
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,225
You are a peaceful person.

44
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:32,485
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

45
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:38,008
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

46
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:39,008
You will not do that.

47
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:49,775
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

48
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:59,525
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

49
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,433
to them, they won't like it.

50
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:06,034
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

51
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:09,874
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:19,284
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

53
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:28,284
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

54
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:38,284
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

55
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:42,955
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

56
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:51,654
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

57
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:52,654
things.

58
00:15:52,654 --> 00:16:04,184
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

59
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,184
point.

60
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:11,295
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

61
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,205
He was born.

62
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,684
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

63
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:26,775
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

64
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:32,325
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

65
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,675
It's very difficult to talk to them.

66
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:44,904
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

67
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,195
Who was Babar?

68
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:52,874
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

69
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:55,864
No, it was not.

70
00:16:55,864 --> 00:17:03,964
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

71
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:05,865
call it a Babri Masjid.

72
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:13,684
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

73
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:19,654
He died, but he came from abroad.

74
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,915
He was not even an Indian.

75
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,575
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

76
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:33,265
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

77
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:41,564
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

78
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:43,874
Rama was born.

79
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:51,265
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

80
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:54,594
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

81
00:17:54,594 --> 00:18:02,255
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

82
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:09,555
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

83
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:16,394
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

84
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:29,335
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

85
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,624
Kashmir.

86
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:35,195
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

87
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:37,975
How do you know?

88
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:42,495
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

89
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:49,435
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

90
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:54,375
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

91
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,406
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

92
00:18:58,406 --> 00:18:59,406
He said, "Why?"

93
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:00,406
"Because I want to go."

94
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:07,174
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

95
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:09,145
"It doesn't matter.

96
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,465
Take it."

97
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:21,005
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

98
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:24,175
them, "What is here going on?"

99
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:29,995
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

100
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:34,535
Even the name gives you such peace.

101
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:37,965
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

102
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:45,205
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

103
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:48,385
It's very surprising.

104
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:55,965
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

105
00:19:55,965 --> 00:20:01,835
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

106
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,885
For example, they say, "Allah."

107
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,604
Who is Allah?

108
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:16,935
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

109
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,294
Ram.

110
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:26,385
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

111
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:29,205
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

112
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:34,645
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

113
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:46,755
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

114
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:54,265
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

115
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:58,065
Hindus are also not understanding.

116
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:03,885
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

117
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:07,474
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

118
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,265
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

119
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:20,705
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

120
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:22,085
They never have vibrations.

121
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:27,455
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

122
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:29,855
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

123
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,765
But they have no point to prove.

124
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:40,685
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

125
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:47,904
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

126
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,784
But they are all - what should I say?

127
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:57,115
- Absolutely blocked people.

128
00:21:57,115 --> 00:22:01,305
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

129
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:09,315
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

130
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:16,805
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

131
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:25,195
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

132
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,854
got Self Realization.

133
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:29,885
You are all Realized Souls.

134
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:39,745
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

135
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:46,995
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

136
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:53,094
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

137
00:22:53,094 --> 00:23:00,164
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

138
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:02,375
find this is the problem.

139
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:08,914
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

140
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:18,785
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

141
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:21,305
very great people.

142
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:26,724
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

143
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:32,765
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

144
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:38,164
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

145
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:39,705
They're much beyond you."

146
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:52,544
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

147
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,505
It was a very big gap before.

148
00:23:55,505 --> 00:24:02,755
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

149
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,234
kinds of things.

150
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,515
Now you are so many.

151
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:15,876
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

152
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:16,876
you.

153
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:17,876
I would request you only one thing.

154
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:27,534
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

155
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,104
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

156
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:33,875
This is a common thing.

157
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:38,555
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

158
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:39,555
He got exposed."

159
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,815
"Means, what happened?"

160
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,995
"He was exposed, Mother.

161
00:24:43,995 --> 00:24:46,714
He was put in jail."

162
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:49,445
"Aiy, this is too much.

163
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,924
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

164
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,234
So this is the problem.

165
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:58,865
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

166
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,565
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

167
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:05,484
Must try to purify yourself.

168
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,484
You have to change.

169
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:13,784
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

170
00:25:13,784 --> 00:25:14,784
out.

171
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:15,914
It won't work out.

172
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:24,234
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

173
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:28,044
Why I love children?

174
00:25:28,044 --> 00:25:30,914
Because they're innocent.

175
00:25:30,914 --> 00:25:33,085
They don't have all these things.

176
00:25:33,085 --> 00:25:44,635
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

177
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:48,854
It's not simple.

178
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:56,745
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

179
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,495
Now why?

180
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:01,995
Because they want money.

181
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,745
All right.

182
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:06,205
Then what do they do with their money?

183
00:26:06,205 --> 00:26:15,654
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

184
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:19,734
the money gets lost.

185
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,875
If not, they are caught up.

186
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:25,094
That's not so important.

187
00:26:25,094 --> 00:26:30,495
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

188
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:38,435
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

189
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,645
at least have some fear of God.

190
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:46,005
But the rich are very greedy.

191
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:49,145
They're running after this, running after
that.

192
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:52,085
There's no end to it.

193
00:26:52,085 --> 00:27:01,025
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

194
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:07,895
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

195
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:11,234
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

196
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:19,685
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

197
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:24,605
There's no place for love for the right side.

198
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:37,335
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

199
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,435
We can never progress.

200
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:45,235
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

201
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:46,235
it.

202
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:55,814
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

203
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:58,425
But that love is missing.

204
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:02,285
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

205
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:08,465
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

206
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,485
Love is not limited.

207
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:14,115
Love has to be unlimited.

208
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:19,215
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

209
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:30,125
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

210
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:37,935
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

211
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:46,385
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

212
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:55,255
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

213
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:59,415
Money is the enemy of love.

214
00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:06,865
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

215
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:08,765
I'm hopeless, I agree.

216
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:12,285
I don't know how to take interest even.

217
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:15,145
What is so interesting about it?

218
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:21,765
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

219
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:24,025
I said, "I know."

220
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:29,175
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

221
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:32,015
There's so many other things to be interested.

222
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:33,795
You see the children.

223
00:29:33,795 --> 00:29:35,814
You see nice, nice people.

224
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:42,465
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

225
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:50,064
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

226
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:58,155
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

227
00:29:58,155 --> 00:30:00,125
In India is the worst, I think.

228
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:04,985
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

229
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:09,775
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

230
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:22,995
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

231
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:34,235
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

232
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,235
- absolutely.

233
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:47,175
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

234
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:52,865
There's no interest in money.

235
00:30:52,865 --> 00:31:02,435
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

236
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:08,465
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

237
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:13,385
You have not purchased it.

238
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:15,304
Nobody has to purchase it.

239
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:18,155
It's free, flowing everywhere.

240
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:21,005
It's so joy giving.

241
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,655
What else do you want with money?

242
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:24,655
Nothing.

243
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:32,875
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

244
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:50,674
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

245
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:56,875
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

246
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,954
Nothing is dependent on money.

247
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:09,865
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

248
00:32:09,865 --> 00:32:14,745
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

249
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:21,055
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

250
00:32:21,055 --> 00:32:23,785
They commit suicides.

251
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:24,785
Why?

252
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:30,085
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

253
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:32,975
What is the gain they have?

254
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:44,785
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

255
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:52,045
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

256
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:59,285
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

257
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:05,545
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

258
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:10,025
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

259
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:16,275
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

260
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:23,085
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

261
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,225
are you doing?

262
00:33:24,225 --> 00:33:26,495
Why are you wasting your time?

263
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:34,935
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

264
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:40,055
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

265
00:33:40,055 --> 00:33:45,755
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

266
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:53,505
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

267
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:54,665
who should provide.

268
00:33:54,665 --> 00:34:00,495
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

269
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:03,335
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

270
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,184
They are not spiritual.

271
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,165
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

272
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:17,174
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

273
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:19,137
What is the social work?

274
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:22,405
Looking after the poor or something like that.

275
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:33,806
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

276
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:45,215
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

277
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:52,885
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

278
00:34:52,885 --> 00:35:01,375
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

279
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,335
First is forgiveness.

280
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,545
You have to forgive people.

281
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:07,695
They are utterly stupid.

282
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:14,095
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

283
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:17,265
So, nothing to worry about that.

284
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:26,324
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

285
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:38,814
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

286
00:35:38,814 --> 00:35:42,485
sort of a - I should say what?

287
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:43,845
- some grouping.

288
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:47,905
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

289
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,935
We are self-sufficient.

290
00:35:49,935 --> 00:35:51,684
We don't need anything.

291
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:54,915
If you are one, we are all right.

292
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:57,415
If you are many, we are all right.

293
00:35:57,415 --> 00:36:06,275
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

294
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:10,335
love, that Universal Love of God.

295
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:16,615
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

296
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:21,565
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

297
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:26,735
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

298
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:31,365
It's all something to be thought of.

299
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:34,304
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

300
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:38,285
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

301
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:40,377
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

302
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:41,377
Not possible.

303
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:47,835
You should have no interest in all these things.

304
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:56,975
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

305
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:59,145
Nobody can touch you.

306
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:05,215
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

307
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:11,625
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

308
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,975
What is your role?

309
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:14,324
What is your position?

310
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:26,174
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

311
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:27,174
you should know.

312
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:37,195
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

313
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:41,935
You're not competitive.

314
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:50,064
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

315
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:53,225
I know how the blessings work.

316
00:37:53,225 --> 00:38:01,574
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

317
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,895
Your loving nature.

318
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:15,944
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

319
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:17,684
of God.

320
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:24,814
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

321
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:32,865
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

322
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:36,235
They don't want something very extraordinary.

323
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:48,595
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

324
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:52,005
change the whole world.

325
00:38:52,005 --> 00:39:00,375
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

326
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:10,225
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

327
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:11,255
been achieved.

328
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:16,355
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

329
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:17,885
Think about it.

330
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:20,444
What you need is introspection.

331
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:21,885
What you need is understanding.

332
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:26,795
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

333
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:33,554
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

334
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:36,544
And that has to be done.

335
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:38,534
May God bless you.
