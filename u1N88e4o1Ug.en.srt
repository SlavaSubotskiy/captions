1
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:53,000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

2
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:57,626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

3
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,584
For example, today is Wednesday

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

5
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,542
because I was born on Wednesday.

6
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,259
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

7
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:17,301
we’ll be able to manage it

8
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,501
because I was born at twelve.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

10
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:28,259
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

11
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,800
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

13
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,092
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

14
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,259
that you all are ready for a Puja

15
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,967
and that we could break this rule also,

16
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,301
after such a long time,

17
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:57,800
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,426
I was trying, trying, trying

19
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:03,042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

22
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:27,334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
and I don’t know how far

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can go with the description of this great country

25
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,375
which we call as Greece.

26
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,259
and a “dweep” is a island.

29
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,384
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

30
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:07,459
and there is a temple of Athena,

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

32
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,250
jewelry, dress and everything.

33
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,050
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

34
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

35
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,259
So now, one may say that,

36
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

38
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:41,800
One may ask a question like that,

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

41
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:03,417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

42
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,375
where it was planned,

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,584
then there was something of the –

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

46
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:32,417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

48
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:48,175
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

49
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,175
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

50
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,667
and create vibrations there.

51
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:58,467
Now in the material form the Gokul was

52
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

53
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:11,209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

54
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:18,042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

55
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:22,709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

56
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

57
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,584
but She lived in this area

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

59
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:39,584
to create the universal

60
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:45,384
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

61
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:52,584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

62
00:06:54,459 --> 00:07:01,459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

63
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

66
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:20,050
But the Adi Shakti’s work

67
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

68
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:28,709
and to integrate all those qualities,

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,800
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

71
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But as it is,

73
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,050
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

74
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,092
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

75
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

76
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,175
And this is the…

77
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,584
where She created the Devaloka.

78
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:05,000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

79
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,000
Like She created Indra –

80
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,175
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

81
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:16,375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Devaloka was created on this side,

83
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:25,009
and ganas and all these people were created

84
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:29,667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

85
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

86
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:46,259
in such a condition when people were really,

87
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,050
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

88
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,092
they could not understand Him,

89
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:55,092
they could not understand Socrates at all

90
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:00,259
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

91
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:04,459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

92
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,050
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

93
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,301
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

94
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:17,000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

95
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

96
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
and they started their own theories, own styles,

97
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,800
and that’s how we find the accent from

98
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

99
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:38,134
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

100
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:42,175
So the attention was moved from philosophy

101
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,175
to economics today,

102
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:50,467
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

103
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:55,217
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

104
00:09:55,417 --> 00:10:03,092
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

105
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:09,292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

106
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,175
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

107
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,800
Abraham had different problems.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,883
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

109
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

111
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,050
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

112
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,800
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,709
and if you read Bible, in the –

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

115
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:51,301
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

116
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:56,092
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

117
00:10:56,292 --> 00:11:00,292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,626
So He did not argue, He did not say

119
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:08,301
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

120
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,342
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

121
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

122
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:21,667
that you understand this or

123
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,626
that you see the point;

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,417
He could not do that way.

125
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,009
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

127
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

128
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,417
Because the people were of that type.

129
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,925
Now then you see how gradually,

130
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,967
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

131
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,092
they were a much better people

132
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:55,292
so He could talk to them about something

133
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,050
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

134
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,050
Of so many things He talked,

135
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

138
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:19,626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

139
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:24,584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

141
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

142
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:38,667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

143
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:42,967
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

144
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,626
and the relationships were building up,

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,092
and He tried to work it on that level.

146
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:54,292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

147
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

148
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,342
So they evolved to this point

149
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:05,217
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

150
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:10,584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,134
taking their freedom, getting out from there

152
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:22,000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

153
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,384
But when they did that,

154
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:28,384
He found these people on the way –

155
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:32,175
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

156
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,375
when He came back – what He finds…

157
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

158
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:09,334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,217
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

160
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:17,259
extremely immoral character.

161
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,800
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

162
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,134
that nobody can believe that anybody

163
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:29,009
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

164
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

165
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:37,626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

166
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:46,209
Now then came the time when people were…

167
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:52,925
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

168
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,125
we can say at the time of Christ,

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,459
but they were not so immoral;

170
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,626
they also could not understand Christ.

171
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:07,217
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

172
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,925
the human awareness evolving,

173
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:16,209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

174
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,667
and you could not talk to them.

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,626
When the circumstances are such,

177
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:33,000
like at the time of, say Moses,

178
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,342
that people are extremely immoral,

179
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:39,542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

180
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

181
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:52,125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because they were so left-sided:

183
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,009
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

184
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,800
and say that, “If you do like this,

185
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

186
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
So they took to violence.

187
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

188
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:21,967
also the awareness of human beings.

189
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,167
So many things worked it out.

190
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:30,125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

191
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:39,167
her job was to create a integrated force

192
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:50,250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

193
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:58,584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

194
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:07,042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

195
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:14,292
You have to integrate people

196
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

197
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,842
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

198
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,800
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

199
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

200
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

201
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:47,092
and despite that they resisted him

202
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,292
because they were given this special capacity.

203
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,301
Something with Greeks, they went to…

204
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:57,501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

205
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:03,334
who tried to invade India,

206
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

207
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,667
You see it’s a Greek nature

208
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,375
that they can go so far and then not,

209
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,375
because they have an integrating force.

210
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:22,626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

211
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:28,167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

212
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,459
So this power of receding back

213
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:37,000
is the integrating power,

214
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,925
by you integrate within yourself

215
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:44,967
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

216
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,501
and you see now that’s alright.

217
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,342
If you have to be in the centre

218
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,542
we should go up to a point and come back.

219
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:59,417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

220
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,967
If you take their shipping,

221
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:05,384
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

222
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:07,709
extremely aggressive people,

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

224
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,800
They were not very law-abiding

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,426
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

226
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:21,301
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

227
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:26,925
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

228
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:32,167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

229
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:37,501
So perhaps, perhaps,

230
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

231
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:44,709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

232
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:48,925
Then when the shipping went down –

233
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

234
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
they sunk their ships

235
00:19:56,501 --> 00:20:00,501
and got the money out of insurance.

236
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,883
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

237
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:16,250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

238
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,009
they know that how far to go.

239
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:22,667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

240
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:25,925
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

241
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,967
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

242
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

243
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,883
but most of his property went to his daughter,

244
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

245
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:46,384
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

246
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:50,134
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

247
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,050
like Americans are.

248
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,342
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

249
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:57,384
but Greeks can never become idiots,

250
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,584
whatever you may try.

251
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

252
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:07,501
but they know how far to go with everything.

253
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

254
00:21:12,584 --> 00:21:16,259
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

255
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,459
and She created Ganesha here.

256
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:23,384
And the balance of the universe,

257
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,259
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

258
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:32,042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

259
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,134
You can find them very…

260
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:43,209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

261
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,342
One may say because they are traditional people,

262
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,542
they have long traditions.

263
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

264
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,342
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

265
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:59,417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

266
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:04,667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

267
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

269
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,334
but they are not like Indians.

270
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:25,292
So what is lacking in all these people is

271
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:30,292
the depth of awareness

272
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:37,375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

273
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:44,626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

274
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:51,301
and China rose also, afterwards,

275
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:54,501
into her own glory

276
00:22:55,042 --> 00:23:00,542
and became quite a good industrial,

277
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

278
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:11,092
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

279
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:14,042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

280
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,134
Do you know last…

281
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:19,092
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

282
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:23,092
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

283
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,883
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

284
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:33,083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

285
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,542
and you see what’s happening in China.

286
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,417
So the effects of these

287
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

288
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:55,292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

289
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:58,009
Now you may say that,

290
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:02,209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

291
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:09,042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

292
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:12,384
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

293
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,050
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

294
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,175
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

295
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:24,334
so I thought that let Greeks

296
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:29,167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

297
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

298
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

299
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:47,050
because actually, at the time

300
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,259
when Athena came here,

301
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:53,584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

302
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:59,584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

303
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

304
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:08,000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

305
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

306
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:15,584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

307
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:22,800
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

308
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,209
most unorthodox,

309
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:29,667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

310
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:37,000
So we have a problem, big problem,

311
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:40,584
how we’ll establish here.

312
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,217
The Devaloka was formed here

313
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:51,417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

314
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

315
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:02,217
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

316
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:09,501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

317
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

318
00:26:18,334 --> 00:26:24,334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

319
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

320
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:33,342
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

321
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:37,542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

322
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,925
And that is responsible for the downfall

323
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:46,167
because this part of the country

324
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:53,334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

325
00:26:54,584 --> 00:27:01,501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

326
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:08,209
we see it has become just the opposite

327
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:16,217
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

328
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:19,375
to such degrading things.

329
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:26,459
Even in the mythology also, in India

330
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:32,542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

331
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:39,209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

332
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

333
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:56,301
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

334
00:27:56,501 --> 00:28:01,842
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

335
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:07,259
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

336
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:12,501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

337
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,459
and from here Indra went down

338
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:21,501
and took away the wife.

339
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:26,501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

340
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:30,301
and Indra went down,

341
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:34,301
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

342
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:38,501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

343
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

344
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:47,967
So now the… see how the combinations are,

345
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:55,301
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

346
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

347
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:03,042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

348
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:07,709
So the Muni Shandilya told

349
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:11,800
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

350
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

351
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:25,042
who will, by his own devotion,

352
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:29,501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

353
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:36,626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

354
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,584
and He will kill this asura.

355
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:45,883
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

356
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:50,083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

357
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,467
So this Narasimha came

358
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:59,501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

359
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,259
little boy played there around and he made some

360
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:08,459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

361
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:13,584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

362
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,967
That was made by Prahlad,

363
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:19,509
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

364
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:23,042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

365
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

366
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:30,209
So see the relationship, how it is.

367
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:35,459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

368
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:43,501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

369
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:51,167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

370
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:57,426
that not any animal can kill him,

371
00:30:57,626 --> 00:31:00,134
not any human being can kill him,

372
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:04,334
not on the land or in the sky,

373
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,800
and not with any weapon –

374
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,800
all so many blessings he had taken!

375
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

376
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,083
so that nobody should kill him,

377
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

378
00:31:23,626 --> 00:31:27,467
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

379
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:31,667
is that He became the simha,

380
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:37,250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

381
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:43,667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

382
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,009
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

383
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:51,209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

384
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

385
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:58,050
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

386
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,217
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

387
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,384
pillar of stone,

388
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:07,584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

389
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

390
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,384
with long hands and claws,

391
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:19,217
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

392
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:24,667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

393
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:30,000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

394
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

395
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:37,301
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

396
00:32:37,501 --> 00:32:42,009
the people of Egypt made their…

397
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:45,584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

398
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:49,584
they were the ones who were asuras,

399
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

400
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

401
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:02,667
the other way round than Narasimha.

402
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:10,467
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

403
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:17,667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

404
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

405
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:30,259
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

406
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:33,459
because all these devas were Greeks –

407
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,967
and these devas were, like Indra,

408
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:40,167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

409
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,175
But I think there… because

410
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

411
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:54,626
they could not see the proper image of their...

412
00:33:56,209 --> 00:34:01,626
of their...faces in their meditation

413
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,842
because they perverted them

414
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,842
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

415
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:11,009
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

416
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:13,800
which was all their own imagination

417
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,967
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

418
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:24,209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

419
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:31,584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

420
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,092
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

421
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:37,426
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

422
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:42,467
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

423
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:46,667
So they made them more like…

424
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:51,217
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

425
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:54,092
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

426
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,342
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

427
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,800
like Varuna, I can tell you.

428
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,967
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

429
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,467
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

430
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:11,167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

431
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,009
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

432
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:17,334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

433
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

434
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,842
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

435
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

436
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,134
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

437
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:38,125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

438
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,092
So with such expense they gave it

439
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:46,125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

440
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,925
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

441
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:56,709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

442
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:05,209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

443
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:09,709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

444
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:16,501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

445
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,375
people had evolved we think,

446
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
but they also crucified Christ,

447
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:26,050
so what was their evolution?

448
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:33,125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

449
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:38,459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

450
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,584
there is much difference

451
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:47,375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

452
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:52,009
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

453
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:55,259
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

454
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:59,384
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

455
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,000
But still He was also killed;

456
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:07,375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

457
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:12,042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

458
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

459
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:22,501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

460
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:26,626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

461
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:32,967
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

462
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

463
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,125
500 before Christ;

464
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:45,259
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

465
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:49,167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

466
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,459
as because He was Primordial Master.

467
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:57,334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

468
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

469
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

470
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:12,301
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

471
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:16,459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

472
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:21,175
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

473
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:25,175
they would not accept any person,

474
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:28,134
they would throw away, they would beat people.

475
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:32,301
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

476
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,009
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

477
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,125
like very harsh people.

478
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,467
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

479
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,800
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

480
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

481
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,584
See, He saw the point

482
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

483
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,842
talking in that way.

484
00:38:57,042 --> 00:39:00,009
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

485
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:02,542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

486
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,301
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

487
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:09,459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

488
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,092
He’s a master of logic.

489
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:18,000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

490
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:22,092
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

491
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:26,667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

492
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:30,967
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

493
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

494
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:37,626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

495
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,042
So He talked to them in parables,

496
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,667
but still they killed Him.

497
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:49,259
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

498
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:53,667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

499
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:57,292
were very funny, and they did it.

500
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

501
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:08,542
I should give Realisation to people first,

502
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:13,709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

503
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:16,842
Now, I’m talking to you everything

504
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,883
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

505
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

506
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:28,167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

507
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,175
and one who are not.

508
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:34,342
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

509
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:38,925
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

510
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:45,134
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

511
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:49,134
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

512
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:53,175
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

513
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:56,800
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

514
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

515
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,259
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

516
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,301
where collectively you are understanding Me.

517
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,509
The situation is not so bad as that was

518
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:15,217
even at the time of Christ.

519
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,342
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

520
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,542
He was the only wise man going around.

521
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,301
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

522
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,342
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

523
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:30,501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

524
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,209
Both of them, really,

525
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,925
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

526
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,175
which were all absolutely.

527
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,134
But He talked absolutely…

528
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,426
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

529
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,626
and talked so openly.

530
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:53,417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

531
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:56,584
the Primordial Master state is that

532
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

533
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:05,459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

534
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,584
Then came Nanaka;

535
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

536
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:17,292
and the people who really follow Him are just

537
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:20,217
in the opposite direction.

538
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,800
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

539
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,009
so they are going in that way.

540
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:29,925
You find even same thing with Christ;

541
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:34,459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

542
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,925
Every religion is just the same.

543
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,925
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

544
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,542
Those who preach Gita are just…

545
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,050
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

546
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,883
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

547
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,342
going down, taking people down.

548
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,542
So it is common with all religions

549
00:42:56,501 --> 00:43:01,292
that they have always used the name of prophets

550
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:08,301
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

551
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:15,501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

552
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:18,800
So, now those who are alert about it,

553
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

554
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

555
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:30,667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

556
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

557
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,050
instead of going themselves down.

558
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:45,050
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

559
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,883
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

560
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,709
If Athena could be awakened here,

561
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:56,000
this place could be of very great help to us.

562
00:43:56,584 --> 00:44:02,009
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

563
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:06,800
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

564
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,384
also they have lots of qualities of

565
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:19,125
understanding the worthlessness of

566
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:26,050
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

567
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,259
But the immorality grew,

568
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:32,050
now, because they started copying Westerners;

569
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

570
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:40,167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

571
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,842
Before that the women were very moral,

572
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:46,501
very good women lived here,

573
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

574
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,842
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

575
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:58,175
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

576
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,800
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

577
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,800
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

578
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

579
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:12,042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

580
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,217
They may use a woman who has no character

581
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:17,426
but they respect the woman who has character

582
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:19,925
and also respect the mother.

583
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:23,259
So there are lots of qualities in this country

584
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:27,050
which are still existing,

585
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:31,626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

586
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:35,967
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

587
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:42,175
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

588
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

589
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,250
May God bless you!

590
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:08,175
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

591
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

592
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,250
He was very much respected in India, always,

593
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

594
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:35,334
and because he went away

595
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:39,042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

596
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

597
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,709
I think he got quite detached

598
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:51,175
after coming to India. Anybody who has

599
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,342
come to invade India, and has really gained something

600
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:58,667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

601
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,800
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

602
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,967
three hundred years.

603
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

604
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

605
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:14,042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

606
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,250
nothing went into their heads.

607
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:21,709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

608
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,426
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

609
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:28,626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

610
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:34,301
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

611
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:38,000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

612
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:41,217
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

613
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:45,125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

614
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:49,000
who was at the time of Alexander.

615
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:53,709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

616
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:57,134
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

617
00:47:57,334 --> 00:48:00,375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

618
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:05,626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

619
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,167
to England;

620
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,967
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

621
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:13,967
and the sign of awareness is this, that

622
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:17,501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

623
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:22,334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

624
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:27,092
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

625
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:30,259
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

626
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:34,092
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

627
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:35,883
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

628
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,842
so he went back and told his king that,

629
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:40,967
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

630
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:43,083
They are not Muslims”.

631
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,842
So simple he was.

632
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:50,050
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

633
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

634
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,842
He was a nice man.

635
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,967
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

636
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:00,584
but still certain respect they showed, like

637
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

638
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,083
They still call it Mumbai.

639
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,050
many words Mumbai

640
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,301
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

641
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,092
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

642
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

643
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,125
so they call it Mumbai –

644
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,375
is the name of the Goddess.

645
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,584
So they didn’t want to change it.

646
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:27,092
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

647
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,092
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

648
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:31,384
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

649
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:33,083
I said, “It is.”

650
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:37,000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

651
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:43,301
So you see the… see the awareness,

652
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:46,134
you can see the awareness of people

653
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:51,384
because they were so aware about the serenity,

654
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:55,092
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

655
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,842
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

656
00:49:57,042 --> 00:49:59,584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

657
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:03,626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

658
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,092
But the English could have gone and found out

659
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:10,050
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

660
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,259
But they did not.

661
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:14,301
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

662
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

663
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,667
because, you see, that respect

664
00:50:21,209 --> 00:50:23,542
for serenity and all these things,

665
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,217
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

666
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:32,292
Now the children of Britain

667
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:36,042
are better, are very different, very different.

668
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:39,667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

669
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:47,209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

670
00:50:48,209 --> 00:50:52,209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

671
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,375
they came with respect.

672
00:50:55,584 --> 00:51:01,542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

673
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,301
And now, as the time has passed,

674
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:07,083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

675
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:10,467
they’re respecting, many.

676
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,925
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

677
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:18,083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

678
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:27,375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

679
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,134
That is the part lacking in England.

680
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:33,667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

681
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

682
00:51:37,209 --> 00:51:40,209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

683
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:50,584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

684
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:56,967
respecting others, respecting their culture,

685
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:01,292
respecting their lifestyle.

686
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:07,042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

687
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:11,000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

688
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,175
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

689
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:17,584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

690
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,426
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

691
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:23,626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

692
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:29,092
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

693
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:32,709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

694
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:36,092
So that is there but just theory.

695
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:40,009
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

696
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:45,626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

697
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and fasting for South Africa.

698
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,709
So between the South African awareness

699
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,342
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

700
00:52:56,542 --> 00:53:00,542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

701
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:06,259
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

702
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:09,459
I think it can transform the whole world.

703
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:13,501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

704
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,417
It has to be respect.

705
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,375
It is not insulting now,

706
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:27,009
but it is not positive respect.

707
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:30,925
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

708
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,509
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

709
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:37,626
This is what I have been talking about,

710
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:41,417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

711
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

712
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:48,925
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

713
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,125
because still they have a sense of respect.

714
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:59,083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

715
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:04,259
That part is there, that one has to learn.

716
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:08,459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

717
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:15,542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

718
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,175
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

719
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:23,334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

720
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:30,709
And respect is something from your heart.

721
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:35,050
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

722
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

723
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:42,092
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

724
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,259
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

725
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:48,709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

726
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:55,542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

727
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:59,217
and when that works out then

728
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:03,125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

729
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:08,250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

730
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:13,501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

731
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:18,125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

732
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:21,467
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

733
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:25,667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

734
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:28,584
And that it’s not what you get,

735
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,092
it’s not what you have,

736
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:36,292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

737
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:43,301
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

738
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,426
because there’s a big understanding

739
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:47,709
now between you and the Divine,

740
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,384
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

741
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:54,584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

742
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:59,883
learn that respect, then things will work out.

743
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,050
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

744
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

745
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,459
May God bless you!
