1
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:30,315
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:45,682
First of all, we have to know what is the truth we are seeking

3
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,837
and how we are going to seek it

4
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,566
and what is the proof that you have got the truth.

5
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:11,967
Firstly, you must know that you cannot purchase the truth.

6
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:21,036
It is, you cannot market it,

7
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,323
because truth is love

8
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:32,767
and love is compassion.

9
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:49,954
So now I am going to tell you about the truth, about how in Greece they knew about the truth.

10
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,963
Yours is a very, very ancient country.

11
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:12,296
And in our country also, in our old books, the ancient Puranas, it’s mentioned about your country.

12
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:24,644
They have described Athena very clearly.

13
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:38,242
And gradually this great country became absolutely ignorant of whatever they knew.

14
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:58,132
Now between you and Me, I would like to tell you that there is a power within us in the triangular bone.

15
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:10,700
If you can move out then somebody can show you.

16
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:14,055
Ok; [Hindi]

17
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:38,916
That is the bone which we call as sacrum.

18
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,209
This name "sacrum" was given by Greeks in those days

19
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,827
meaning sacred.

20
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:08,979
That means they knew there is a sacred bone below the spinal cord.

21
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:22,005
This is the triangular bone that existed

22
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:29,471
and was having this power, which in India we call it Kundalini.

23
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,849
So soon? [Laughter]

24
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:53,655
Sometimes Greek language is very long and sometimes very short.

25
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:18,076
Now this bone has this power and if you see Athena on her shield, she has this power and also, in her hand, she has this power she shows.

26
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:41,150
This power was known to her and we call Athena as the Primordial Mother.

27
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:53,038
The word "atha" in Sanskrit means primordial.

28
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:03,628
But this knowledge was lost later on.

29
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:12,889
Now, from your country went Alexander to India.

30
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,003
And he was Parthenian, Parthenian.

31
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:26,804
He was Parthenian, he was following Parthenian religion, Pagan you can say.

32
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:44,110
But when he went to India, he found that purity was the most important part in the Indian culture.

33
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,465
And he had married an Indian lady.

34
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,393
Also, he had brought a poet, a very well-known poet from India.

35
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:15,911
He described the Persepolis and also, he described Athens, everything in his poetry.

36
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:34,919
But when Alexander came here, he wanted that this Catholic Church should be made into a purer Orthodox style.

37
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:53,693
And I’m sure he must have written some book or he must have said that to maintain purity what we should do.

38
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,886
All that code is the same what we follow in India.

39
00:09:09,656 --> 00:09:14,915
And the Orthodox Church didn’t believe in conversion. We also didn’t believe in conversion.

40
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:29,185
This is the connection we took place in the existence of your Orthodox Church.

41
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:39,008
And they respect, respected, all the religions.

42
00:09:44,632 --> 00:10:00,705
Now, I don’t know what are the changes. But whatever they have been saying and doing, is very met on Indian culture.

43
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:21,439
I think also they got this sannyasi or the renunciation from Buddhism.

44
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,795
There’s a very little difference I find.

45
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,291
But then the Western culture came in

46
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:43,598
and everything went upside down.

47
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:52,274
Moreover, even in India we had the same problem.

48
00:10:56,013 --> 00:11:00,742
The gods they had is the same as we have in India.

49
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:12,158
But the gods, they made them human beings, you see, with lots of weaknesses.

50
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:24,414
But India, in India we don’t think that way. Gods are gods.

51
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:33,122
So, this is the basis on which you are here.

52
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,764
It’s easier for Me to talk to you than to talk to English.

53
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:53,257
Now this power existed in the triangular bone and is called as Kundalini.

54
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,993
It is in three and a half coils.

55
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:17,331
And when it rises, it passes through six centers and pierces through the last centre, which we call as Brahmarandra.

56
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,309
This is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

57
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:43,165
It is not just somebody can say, “Now, I bless you.” It’s not like that. You have to have spiritual authority.

58
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:56,293
And now it is happening everywhere.

59
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:09,953
Somehow it is spreading very fast and I think now we have about, they say so, seventy-two nations where we have Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:25,076
So, when she rises, she nourishes all the centers. She nourishes all the centers

61
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:34,147
and integrates them.

62
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:41,484
When they are integrated you become a personality of integration.

63
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:50,913
But by that your Spirit is enlightened.

64
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,184
And you become the Spirit.

65
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:11,853
So, the truth is, we are not this body, this mind, these emotions, your thoughts, ambitions, but you are the pure Spirit.

66
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:24,593
That you have to become.

67
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:35,246
As soon as you become the Spirit, all these problems, human problems, drop out.

68
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:45,329
Physically you get perfect health.

69
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:52,978
Mentally you get absolutely balanced,

70
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:03,635
and emotionally you are absolutely satisfied.

71
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,140
You become a saint

72
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:13,007
in the real sense of the word.

73
00:15:15,386 --> 00:15:23,114
But what you feel is the, in your hands, you see, you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

74
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:36,793
There’s another thing great that you believe in the Mother, Holy Mother.

75
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:45,166
But in the Bible, she is just described as woman.

76
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:53,946
But on the cross Christ said, “Behold the Mother.”

77
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:06,876
But due to the human feeling and human understanding, you have Madonna.

78
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,194
Especially Orthodox Church respects Madonna very much.

79
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:31,216
The only maybe difference is that in Indian philosophy you have to achieve your Self-realization.

80
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,963
That part should have been stressed.

81
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:50,864
And you should get the actualization, actualization of your baptism.

82
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:57,366
You have to be born again.

83
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:07,284
But if you just, say, take a sort of a certificate, “I’m born again,” you don’t become it.

84
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,140
It has to happen really

85
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:23,764
that you are born again as a Self-realized personality.

86
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,401
Now the time has come for it

87
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:37,332
and it is working out in so many countries. Why not in Greece?

88
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:47,130
All this is very simple.

89
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,720
We call it "sahaja", meaning spontaneous,

90
00:17:55,594 --> 00:18:04,865
like one candle, one candle, which is enlightened, can enlighten many candles.

91
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:16,137
But, by itself the candle cannot get enlightened.

92
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:24,594
If you are enlightened then you can enlighten others.

93
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:34,801
You can also then start feeling the others on your fingertips

94
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:46,553
because your attention and your personality becomes collective.

95
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,226
Who is the other?

96
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,178
But this has to happen, this has to work out.

97
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:16,225
Everyone is endowed with a Kundalini and everyone can get Self-realization.

98
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:26,379
But Kundalini is the pure desire

99
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:36,731
and if you have the pure desire to become the Spirit, you will get it.

100
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:45,125
All desires are impure.

101
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:52,247
Today, you want to have a car and you are not satisfied.

102
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:57,748
And you want to have a house; you are not satisfied. It goes on like this, you see, it’s economics.

103
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,942
So, there is no satisfaction.

104
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:21,101
But after you get your Realization then the satisfaction settles in,

105
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:31,604
because you become thoughtlessly aware,

106
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:38,711
because you become a witness.

107
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,076
You just watch, you don’t react.

108
00:20:45,363 --> 00:20:49,076
For example, see, there’s a beautiful carpet here.

109
00:20:52,475 --> 00:21:00,181
As a normal human being, I’ll think, “Oh, my God, this’ a nice carpet. Where will I find it? How much will I pay?”

110
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:10,470
And if it is mine, I’ll be more worried

111
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:17,552
that, "This should not get spoilt. I’ll get insured or something".

112
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:29,447
But if I am a Self-realized person, then I’ll just watch it

113
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,955
and don’t react.

114
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:43,180
The beauty that the artist has put in it gives such joy!

115
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,976
So, you become full of joy.

116
00:21:54,881 --> 00:22:01,039
Your attention becomes enlightened, attention.

117
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:08,415
Wherever you pay attention, it works out.

118
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:14,741
All your problems are solved.

119
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,306
Very surprisingly how they are solved so easily!

120
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:29,475
And you get rid of your worries, all your problems.

121
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:44,524
Also, other bad enemies we have, like anger, jealousy and all that, six of them,

122
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,776
they all drop out.

123
00:22:56,815 --> 00:23:00,038
You start laughing at yourself

124
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:07,912
and nothing but compassion and love flows from your heart.

125
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,659
This is what exactly happens to you.

126
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:26,387
And when that happens you really enjoy yourself and you enjoy others.

127
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:36,742
You are so much filled with joy

128
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:48,086
that you become enthralled with it. You become enthralled.

129
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:59,556
I mean, we have now people from all over the world, also sitting here.

130
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:06,509
Some have come even from Australia.

131
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:16,960
But they are so much one with each other as if a drop has become the sea, ocean.

132
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:26,475
It has to happen.

133
00:24:28,174 --> 00:24:31,488
We talk of peace; we talk of this and that.

134
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,278
By talking is not going to work out.

135
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:50,255
Only when we cross the limits of our human personality and become one with each other, automatically the peace comes in.

136
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:03,004
This is what one has to achieve.

137
00:25:05,878 --> 00:25:14,564
No arguments, no payments, nothing needed, only this Kundalini has to rise.

138
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:25,624
It is the living process of your evolution.

139
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:36,521
From this human awareness you have to rise to a collective awareness.

140
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:49,424
I must say, this subject is very much deep and very expansive.

141
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:59,011
I must have given thousands of lectures in my life time.

142
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:08,865
But in short one has to know,  why are we here?

143
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:14,707
What do we have to achieve?

144
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:24,615
And once you know what you have achieved, all your problems, all your questions have vanished.

145
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:35,275
So, we have to have our Self-realization.

146
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:41,505
Everyone has said that you are to be born again

147
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:50,764
but you cannot just certify yourself, “I’m born again”.

148
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:09,728
Because there are powers that are bestowed upon you by Kundalini that you start feeling the All-pervading Power of divine love.

149
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:23,357
It’s not falsehood; it’s truth.

150
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:34,728
And that surprises you that how you have suddenly transformed yourself.

151
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,766
We don’t believe in conversion but in resurrection

152
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,752
and the time has come for you to get it.

153
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,638
So, it will take hardly ten minutes for you to get this.

154
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,391
There’s nothing that can be harmful in it.

155
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:16,430
All kinds of diseases have been cured,

156
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:24,315
all kinds of mentally affected people are cured

157
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:36,388
and also emotionally people are now so much detached.

158
00:28:42,351 --> 00:28:50,173
You don’t have to wear these saffron clothes, nothing. It automatically happens inside

159
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:59,989
and you lead a very, very normal life.

160
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:17,324
Now I’ve got great grandchildren. Great grandchildren I have got.

161
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,947
And now I am seventy-seven

162
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,653
and I’m travelling everywhere,

163
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,187
going everywhere.

164
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:40,377
So, you lead a normal life but inside you are peaceful and joyous

165
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,578
and you give joy to others.

166
00:29:50,216 --> 00:29:53,168
That is the need of the day.

167
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,473
Because this is the Last Judgement.

168
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:05,536
Whether you take to falsehood or to truth, it’s your choice.

169
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:19,198
But if you take to truth then you are in the heaven of joy.

170
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:29,053
And at every moment you’ll feel you are blessed.

171
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:40,321
Unless and until you are connected to the Divine, how can you get the blessings?

172
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,192
You can go on praying, doing everything; you are not connected.

173
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:56,181
Supposing this instrument is not connected to the mains, it is useless.

174
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:10,501
In the same way if you are not connected to the Divine you don’t know anything.

175
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:22,287
So, you have to decide, “Would you like to have your Self-realization or not?”

176
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:31,942
If you don’t want to have, nobody can force you.

177
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:36,562
You cannot pay for it,

178
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:47,789
nothing of the kind. So those who don’t want should leave the hall. Then we’ll have the session for ten minutes.

179
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:10,164
Of course, in the beginning you’ll do feel the cool breeze and everything, no doubt, but sometimes people take little time to mature.

180
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:24,637
Also, the bad habits of destruction all fall off.

181
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:39,801
I’ve seen young people giving up drugs overnight, overnight.

182
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,852
That’s it. So, this is for our complete emancipation.

183
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:09,393
Again, I would say, those who don’t want to have Self-realization can leave and nothing can happen to you,

184
00:33:09,393 --> 00:33:17,381
nothing that is disturbing or in any way physically harming. Nothing can happen.

185
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,448
But only thing, you'll get your Self-realization.
