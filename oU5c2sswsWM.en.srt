1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,388
And when we reached there it 
was all covered with ice.

2
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:11,778
It was about 14-15 hours altogether and that
is the same day we had program - same day

3
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,219
in the evening, it was a bit too much.

4
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:21,175
I think, next time you should
see that the day I arrive,

5
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,519
there should be no program
- until next day I can rest.

6
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,910
Aapko aur bhi kisi cheez ke liye
yaad kiya tha bahut

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,050
- Ji haan
- Woh jo aapko case batayi thi na

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,270
- Ji, ji
- Aayiye Hum bata dein

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,300
- Woh log Madras pahunch gaye hain
- Achcha

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,550
wahan kuch zameen khareed li hai aur wahan 
ye laundering ka kaam karne waale hain

11
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:56,351
aur Sahaja Yog ke naam se. Aur kise,
aap wahan kisi to aap kehelwa hi dijiye

12
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:59,462
- Ji haan
- Aur waise Hum unko Home Ministry

13
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:03,204
mein kehla dein kyonki; Hum jaante hain
Dhule sahab jo hain wahan

14
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:06,942
- par aap agar keh dein to bahut hi achcha hoga.
- Mein kehlata huun

15
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:12,299
Unka pata bhi hai aur woh sab wahan aane 
waale hain; Usmein se ek Pakistani

16
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:15,733
- Achcha. Kisse yeh pata kiya?
- Hmm?

17
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,312
- Kisse yeh pata chala?
- Main batata huun aapko

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,432
Yeh inke paas se. Fauran wahan pata kijiye 
kyonki woh aa gaya - 28 tareek to aane
waala tha woh Ravindra

19
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:27,458
- Ji, woh jo woh wahan the Sarin?
- Sarin

20
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:33,100
Sarin aur jo doosre yeh hain, husband wife 
hain hamare yahan - uska, kya naam uska?

21
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:38,287
- Zafar, Dr. Zafar hain na
- Nahin, Zafar to doosra hai Pakistani

22
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:40,724
- Jesopi?
- Aaya kya?

23
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:45,310
- Jesopi, haan Jesopi.
- Jesopi. Woh sab wahin aakar ke 
rehne waale hain

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,940
Unhonne zamin le li hai aur wahan yeh
dhanda karne waale hain.

25
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,293
To waise bhi Jayakar ko bhi hum
inform kar dete hain

26
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,450
- Theek hai
- aur aap bhi kar dijiye yahan matlab yeh

27
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,350
ki un logon ne wakayi kuch aisa
kamaal kiya, ki inka kuch ban nahin paaya.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,233
- Abhi bhi nahin ban payega
- Haan, woh bhaag khade hue

29
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,798
- Abhi bhi nahin hoga
- Annh?

30
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,858
Abhi bhi nahin hoga kisi ko keh 
diya to nahin hoga

31
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:12,428
Haan, aur doosra yeh hua ki bada unhonne
matlab wahan se phone kiye - Alka ko bataya

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,696
ki Indian government pata nahin kya hai,
humko to pehle itna promise kiya tha

33
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,580
aur phir kya pata nahin ho gaya
- aise, waise kaafi complaints

34
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:25,684
Mera ek apne saath mein padhne ka, saath
hi padha hua dost wahan par, IAS mein hai

35
00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:30,044
- Haan
- Wahan par secretary hai Tamilnadu mein

36
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:33,936
- Finance mein
- haan, wahan Tamilnadu, Madras mein

37
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,793
- Tamilnadu mein - wah, wah
- Usko main phone kar deta huun

38
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:41,056
- Usse bata dena. Kya naam hai?
- Rajeshwar Singh. Rajjeshwar Singh hai

39
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:44,180
- hamare saath college mein padhta tha
- Use hi bata dijiye [UNCLEAR]

40
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,287
Usko bata deta huun, hum usko,
theek kar deinge

41
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,577
Woh kara lega kyonki yeh hai
gadbad log bilkul. Dekhiye

42
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:53,873
- Sahaja yog ke naam se shuru kar rahe
- Nahin, main usko kara doonga. I

43
00:02:53,873 --> 00:03:00,083
There are so many dangers now in Sahaja 
yoga. Some of the Sahaja yogis think that

44
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:06,123
they are now Maha-yogis and they start 
talking big about it - very big and

45
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:09,443
- So, how are you?
- Fine [UNCLEAR]

46
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:16,442
and some of them are so stupid, I don't 
know what to say; One fellow started saying,

47
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,241
"I am Adishakti, you see," so I said,
"Alright, why not

48
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,751
send some of My sarees - 
I've too many of them." [LAUGHTER]

49
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:31,386
So, it's some sort of a, I don't know,
possession or maybe - very idiotic

50
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:38,442
and they're educated people and they 
talk like this. Suddenly, a new type of

51
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:42,576
problems have started in Sahaja yoga,
I don't know.

52
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:52,757
It's a kind of a ambition, I think.

53
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,580
I mean, in this gentleman, 
the one who said so,

54
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,351
he is a PhD in Economics - what
do you say to [UNCLEAR].

55
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:10,473
- [UNCLEAR]
- I don't know what's happening to
Economics nowadays.

56
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:20,482
It's quite a big problem. Now, there's a
conference now, in Copenhagen,

57
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:25,504
of all the Prime Ministers and all that.
They want to find out the solution

58
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:32,384
for all the problems we have. Now, they
don't reach the point, that's the thing is

59
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:36,615
they should know is the transformation
of human-beings. You cannot have peace

60
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:42,839
by talking, by having conferences and 
speeches - not that way.

61
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,051
Transformation se hi hoga and this is the 
big problem; No body wants to see the point.

62
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:58,154
All kinds of Prime Ministers are going to 
be there - having a nice conference.

63
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:07,870
Kholiye. And how can they have peace? 
Also another thing which I'm doing now,

64
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,513
is to write a book but they said that, 
"We'll use this book for the whole price."

65
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:19,546
I just don't know what it is. But somebody
has to say here what's happening.

66
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:25,348
Now, if you say that the Western culture
is very licentious, permissive

67
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:30,966
very immoral and all that but the other 
side is, when you have this kind of a culture

68
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:37,740
to oppose it, the fundamentalists - they are
also equally immoral, they are also equally;

69
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,415
They are suppressed people so like, at the
time of Hitler same thing happened.

70
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:52,027
Germany was full of, what you can say, 
corruption, immorality - everything.

71
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:58,171
Horrible! Very decadent! So, he caught 
hold of young people, started telling them,

72
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:06,250
"No, we must have a very moral life and
very austere life," that example and then he

73
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:14,176
made them fight. So they became enamored
by that but while doing all that,

74
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:23,898
they were all suppressed, so the violence
started. That's what is happening with Islam

75
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:30,801
One side they're getting destroyed 
because they are very indulgent

76
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:37,527
second side is, they are so suppressed - 
they are indulgent also but also very violent,

77
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:43,424
so how can you have peace? Only way,
is to have Sahaja culture.

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,590
That's the only way you can really come up
to something - is to have Sahaja culture.

79
00:06:51,476 --> 00:07:01,016
In sahaja culture, you are neither oppressed,
neither suppressed nor you are licentious -

80
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:05,920
you are in the center. 
Then why will you fight?

81
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:14,134
But who's going to tell him - who'll
bell the cat - I don't know.

82
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:18,074
So, I'm writing this book but C.P. said, "It's rather strong,"

83
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:23,428
I said, "Let it be. Somebody has to tell 
them na." But in no way I've been strong

84
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,120
because I just get some, see anecdotes to
show that. So this is this, this is this.

85
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,598
So, he says, "Very unique style of writing
which makes it very interesting."

86
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:41,544
As long as it will go into the heads of people.
So, this way or that way is just the same.

87
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:47,403
I've to tell you, one's austerity and
all that, doesn't help.

88
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:55,946
Once I was going from Riyadh to London and
the ladies came with their burkha and all that

89
00:07:55,946 --> 00:08:02,158
and men came, you see, very with this 
all on their head gear and all, with their

90
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:05,543
- kya kehte hain jo pehente hain
kapda usko, pathani log?

91
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,486
- Pathani suit
- Annh?

92
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:10,337
- Thoga, thoga
- thoga

93
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,839
Haan, thog, thoga they call it. Full 
[UNCLEAR] from here to here

94
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,370
- The robe
- Annh?

95
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,933
- Robe, Mother
- Haan, poora robe - thog kehte usko

96
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:31,746
and I went off to sleep and when I got up,
I saw very dandy looking people with [UNCLEAR]

97
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:36,365
bow ties and all that. I said, "Now, who 
are these people, they've come from?"

98
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:42,631
Very fashionable and the ladies were
in six inches skirts, you see.

99
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:44,828
I said, "Now, from where have they come?"

100
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:49,518
So I asked the air hostess, "Did we stop 
somewhere else?" She said, "No, we are

101
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:54,979
directly flying." I said, "How these people
have come?" Said, "They are the same."

102
00:08:56,271 --> 00:09:02,901
I said, "Really?" "They are the same." Now even
before reaching London they were prepared for it.

103
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:17,244
Aap Mahila pahunch gaye aur wahan se aaye 
hain, ab Mahila se? Kitni dur hai yahan se?

104
00:09:17,244 --> 00:09:19,370
- Do ghante ki flight hai.
- Bas!

105
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,245
- Ji haan.
- Arre baba!

106
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:24,373
- Phir wahan par aana.
- Aayeinge to bilkul nahin.

107
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,252
- Wahan Musalmanon ka raj hai?
- Nahin, Shri Mataji. Bahut

108
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,583
- Catholic hain - sab Christian.
- Catholic log

109
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:35,288
Bahut zyada hain. Woh Spanish ne rule kiya
tha to wahan par Catholic hain aur

110
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:39,677
badi ajeeb si cheez hai ki, ek taraf to 
log haath mein apne Bible le ke padhte rehte

111
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:43,222
hain, padhte rehte hain aur phir fauran
bund karke, jo bhi chahein woh karne ko

112
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:48,068
unko khuli choot hai sab ko, sabhi kuch kar sakte
hain. To poora ek ajeeb sa samaj hai wahan par.

113
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:53,034
Bilkul licentious - sab kuch khulam khulla
choot hai ek tarah se aur doosri taraf

114
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:58,580
sab log church jaate hain. They are all
going to the church regularly

115
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,964
- Aur culture yehi hai?
- Culture is, they could be horrible

116
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:04,895
- [UNCLEAR] America going tomorrow
- Annh, they will go?

117
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:09,463
They will go tomorrow and the slogan -
wahan par ek mazak karte hain log idhar ki

118
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:14,357
- slogan of the community is, people is, 
'Americans go back and take us with you.'

119
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:22,844
So [LAUGHTER]. So you - wahan par ek mazak
hai aur bilkul usse - they're completely

120
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:29,079
dominated aur wahan bilkul bhi American
basis hai ek woh khatam ho gaye hain aur

121
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:32,902
but Catholics hain aur woh kuch
ajeeb tarah ka priests

122
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:36,028
Abhi woh wahan woh nahi aaye
evangelists, evangelist?

123
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:40,727
- Abhi woh John Paul jo gire the wahan par
- Haan, unke bahut aaye the

124
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:46,280
- 16 January ko [UNCLEAR]
- John Paul, what a man he is - really

125
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,762
Ten million people came for the mass on
the 15th of January or... 15th of January

126
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:57,453
he was there. He's very strongly
Catholic dominated

127
00:10:57,453 --> 00:11:02,352
- Conversion
- Conversion nahin but a very bizarre sort of,

128
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:06,585
very because it's Catholic on one side 
and then they have no morality,

129
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,529
- no values, no [UNCLEAR]
- Unka sab chaupat hai.

130
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,470
See, they can't marry again - 
they can have keeps

131
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,367
- Yes, most of them
- Most of [UNCLEAR]

132
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:21,097
- Shri Mataji, one a day kind of situation
- Achcha!

133
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,821
- Bilkul, ji haan. Everything is.....
- There's a lot of

134
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:28,399
- Must have been
- [UNCLEAR] killers, no problem.

135
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:34,038
They can have here as domestic servants
[UNCLEAR] they work for families

136
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:37,637
and they bring up the children
in Hong Kong.

137
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:42,104
- Woh to sab jaate hi hain
- Wahan Sahaja chalega?

138
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:46,286
- Ji haan. Abhi to log chahate honge
- Annh?

139
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:49,120
- Woh aayein hamare saath mein abhi
- Woh to insaan hi hain

140
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,631
- Sri Lanka ke hain, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

141
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,821
- Sri Lanka ke hain?
- Sri Lanka ke hain? Aaap bhi?

142
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:57,404
- Ji. Jo wahan baithi hain
- Achcha! Aap bhi Sri Lanka ke?

143
00:11:57,404 --> 00:12:00,411
- Ji. Hindi nahin bolni aa rahi
- Achcha!

144
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,801
- She's asking if you are from Sri Lanka?
- Yes, we are

145
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:06,581
- and this one
- Annhh ...

146
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:11,468
- and we are now
- We have one called Shri Vardhan

147
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:16,074
Shri Vardhan. Shri Mataji where
You remember Anuma?

148
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:20,257
- Anuma, who brought the first offering?
- Achcha, woh hain wahan?

149
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:23,457
- Sri Lankan. He remembers Shri Mataji
- Achcha! Sahaj hai woh?

150
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:26,999
Sahaj hain, Shri Mataji. Woh ekdam Sahaja
yogini and she came to Mahila

151
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:31,763
and talked to [UNCLEAR] to them 
and when I reached there

152
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:34,567
we started meditating together,
so now it's

153
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,093
Sri Lanka mein to ho jayega par
ye Catholic man to

154
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,183
Use hona padega Mataji;
Aap aayeingi to ho jayega

155
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,752
- Haan to
- Hum log intezaam kareinge kuch agle saal bhi

156
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:49,428
Zaroor aayeinge [UNCLEAR] pata hai, ki
agar aap Christians hain, to ek aankh -

157
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:55,258
if one eye does anything wrong, you take it
out. One hand does wrong, you cut your hand;

158
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:59,038
I've not seen anybody without a hand
or without the eyes.

159
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,890
Mahila mein [UNCLEAR] koi bhi na
bachega, sabhi log hain

160
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,900
- Sabhi aise ho jayeinge?
- Sab. Sirf kaale aur gore reh jayeinge wahan par

161
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,960
Srivastava sahab keh rahe, humne to
koi haath kata dekha nahin.

162
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:16,628
This Pope himself is a horrid fellow.

163
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,133
Aapka jo Bofors ka paisa launder
hua hai woh Pope ke through.

164
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,909
Woh jo hai na Bank of Ambrosia -
Humko saara maloom hai par koi

165
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,189
- use dhyan nahin de, Hum karein kya?
- Koi maanega nahin

166
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:36,903
- Woh dabaa diya hai
- Now with Your blessings Shri Mataji

167
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:40,226
- Hain?
- Now with Your blessings we'll see the

168
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,436
- Ab kuch inka unka bigad gaya hai maamla
- Ji

169
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:45,139
- Prime Minister sahab ka aur [UNCLEAR] ji ka
- Achcha

170
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,529
- Haan. Kaafi rishtedaari bigad gayi.
- Achcha hi hai

171
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,209
Hota hi hai. Falsehood mein yehi pehchaan
hai. Jhagde ho jaate hain

172
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:56,324
Ab to aur bhi zyada honge

173
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:07,763
But somehow Sahaja is spreading
slowly. I mean, I'm surprised

174
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:12,093
that in Philippines there's somebody
who's doing sahaja.

175
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,589
- Shri Mataji, wahan khoob phail jaayega
- Annh?

176
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,151
- Wahan khoob fayl jaayega kyonki [UNCLEAR]
- Log pareshaan hain?

177
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:22,908
Pareshaan hain Shri Mataji aur yahan main
kaam kar raha huun [UNCLEAR] mein,

178
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,791
- bahut mulk ke log hain
- Achcha!

179
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:30,273
aur sab dhoond rahe, sab dhoond rahe.
Bas ab Aapka ashirwad rahe ki

180
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:35,238
- Aapne kaha to ekdam vibrations shuru ho gaye.
- Yes, Shri Mataji, hoga.

181
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:39,337
Par yeh aur chakkarbaazi na ho kahin ki -
yeh bhi badi mushkil hai. Abhi Japan mein,

182
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:45,197
last time those who came, were all guru
shoppers so they got fed up with them, you see.

183
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:51,466
such problems - this problem, that problem
but this time they got better people ki

184
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:55,466
who had done one of the gurus, is
alright but if you are a guru shopper,

185
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:59,236
- to to ho gaya hai kaam waam.
- [UNCLEAR]

186
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:06,662
But they are seekers; These people, who
came, are real seekers.

187
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:16,685
Catholics, waise theek hai, par they
get Left Vishuddhi very bad.

188
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:21,852
- Very bad. Mahila, it's very bad.
- Hmm?

189
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:31,143
- Mahila, it's very bad.
- In Spain also there is very great influence

190
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:38,063
of Catholicism but Sahaja Yoga is working
out. Portugal is something lost also

191
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:45,497
because most of the Portuguese have now
gone to Brazil but in Brazil we're doing

192
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:53,417
very well, you see. The mayor of Brazil, he
had came to the airport and brought a key

193
00:15:53,417 --> 00:16:00,657
for Me and he said, "Mother, this is the 
key of Brazilia, so please bless Brazilia

194
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:07,417
and give us peace." So nice, really,
I was so surprised

195
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:12,388
and then he came to program,
he got his realization.

196
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:20,124
But recently I saw there is one, some
- I forget the name - one of these -

197
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:29,438
- kya kehte usko, log abhi [UNCLEAR]
- Evangelist

198
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:36,049
Haan, Evangelist - uss aadmi ka naam yaad nahin - one Evangelist and thousands

199
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:42,708
stupidly are there and they are supposed
to pay 10% of their salaries, all of them

200
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:48,046
So now, government has an objection
to that. Somebody came from America,

201
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:59,497
this Evangelist. They are so funny. One 
day in Hawaii, we had finished the program

202
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:05,207
and it's 12 0'clock, I said, "Let's see 
what's coming in the news or something."

203
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:13,733
What we find, Evangelists. He had a hundred 
dollar note, you see. He was saying, "See,

204
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:20,761
this if you give, then you get the real
blessings." [UNCLEAR] LAUGHTER

205
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:29,413
There were five of these - one lady had with
her for her groceries and she gave it to us

206
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:35,715
and can you imagine, the grocery arrived
on her doorstep. They're so stupid,

207
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:44,412
these Americans, they believe this and then
they say the grocery started pouring from the

208
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:52,996
roof - can you imagine? And very well 
sitting there - hmm, which as if they've lost.

209
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:59,295
Even they mesmerize somebody -
you cannot digest such a thing - isn't it?

210
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:08,095
Such blatant thing they were talking
and Dev Dumphy was there;

211
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:13,362
looking as if he couldn't believe it. I 
said, "These are Americans , you know."

212
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,813
Bade stupid log hain - Americans
are very stupid.

213
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,375
- Bahut bhole hain, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

214
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,882
- Bahut bhole hain.
- Bhole nahin, bewakoof hain.

215
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,950
- Bewakoof hain
- Stupid, idiotic

216
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,103
- [UNCLEAR]
- They take to all idiotic things.

217
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,388
Abhi woh aajlal, aapka Deepak Chopra,
is making all the money.

218
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,881
- Haanji, haanji, haanji.
- They have also, somehow or the other,

219
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:40,175
managed, I think, the British government,
who are going to give them a land

220
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:46,153
for starting a University. British ki bhi 
khopdi kharaab ho gayi.

221
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:54,605
University they have and they give some sort
of fake degrees - nobody thinks much of it.

222
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,830
- TM number 2, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

223
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,328
- TM number 2
- ATM

224
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:03,511
- TM number 2. Inhonne bana li Geneva mein
- Kahan?

225
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,774
- Switzerland mein to hai hi
- Switzerland mein hai?

226
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,044
- Unki University hai pehle se
- Kahe ki?

227
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:09,604
- [UNCLEAR] ki
- Achcha!

228
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:15,219
University of Creative Intelligence - kya
bol karke. Usmein ek degree dete hain

229
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:18,292
- aur koi doosri yeh ...
- Woh koi maanta nahin lekin

230
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:21,847
Nahin koi nahin maanta - kuch bhi
nahin. NOIDA mein bhi bana rahe

231
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:28,651
- What's that?
- [UNCLEAR]

232
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:37,928
So nice to draw this [UNCLEAR];
Bahut sunder hai

233
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:43,655
[UNCLEAR] Similar ones
we've done last year

234
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:52,329
- Aa, ah! Yeh ek chaudah saal ke ladke ke the
- Baap re!

235
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,812
Very good! Bahut achcha hai.

236
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:02,086
- You've done it?
- I did the translation for the

237
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:05,560
- Haan
- poster. We had Mother a perfect
desire to do that.

238
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,021
- Same thing in tran ..
- Same, the same

239
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,790
So we just send, 'You cannot know
the meaning of your life

240
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:16,145
till you are connected to
the part of the energy'

241
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,908
- What is that?
- 'You cannot know the meaning of your life

242
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:24,828
until you are connected to the power of 
the energy.' It's Your words Shri Mataji.

243
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:34,469
- No one is created.
- Created [UNCLEAR] created

244
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,509
- Until you are connected with the Whole, you can't
- Connected [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

245
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:44,161
- Nahin, created, created you
- Created you, is it?

246
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,890
- Origin of life is said - is it? 
- Created is not translated. They were
created is not translated

247
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,426
- No, that's what
- Put the Origin of Life

248
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,666
- Hmm, Origin
- Yes, Mother

249
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:59,523
Sometimes you have to use this
scripted line, isn't it?

250
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:19,753
That's the birthday [UNCLEAR] preparation.
We've put also Chinese on the other side.

251
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:25,465
- Haan... this is what is invitation
- Invitation, yeah.

252
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:30,706
- and this one is?
- This is celebration - the
beginning of the program in the evening

253
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:43,622
Very, very nice! Chinese have a real sense
of art! This means the center?

254
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:55,024
- Yes, the central channel.
- Central channel. Same in Japanese?

255
00:21:55,238 --> 00:22:00,868
Yes, yes. In this they borrow our
characters [LAUGHTER]

256
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:05,286
- I hope, they cannot beat you. [LAUGHTER]
- They copy [UNCLEAR]

257
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:11,762
- Just see this, Shri Mataji, bulletin.
- So we kept the side frame [UNCLEAR]

258
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:17,436
That's very good. Bahut achcha photo hai,
dekhiye; Ek 14 saal ke ladke ne liya tha

259
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:23,831
6 photographs hain bahut advanced
camare se, photo

260
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,605
- Hai kya [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

261
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:26,605
- Bilkul hain
- Hanumanji hain?

262
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:30,202
Bilkul hain. Thode se colors
mein banaya hai

263
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:34,697
- Yeh banaya hai?
- Nahin, matlab photo hai, ye photograph

264
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:41,972
- Bilkul
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

265
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:50,459
Hong Kong is being transformed through the 
persons, Shri Mataji - all other Hong Kong

266
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:57,072
- This is from Angelina?
- I think, this one was taken Mathew,

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,581
- Annh?
- Kohli sahab ka beta hai

269
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,592
- Woh to pata hai Mujhe.
- Usi ne kiya hai.

270
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,424
- This whole thing is done by you here?
- Yes, [UNCLEAR] in Hong Kong

271
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:12,910
- [UNCLEAR] 
- I know [UNCLEAR] So to pata hai Mujhe ladka.

272
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,184
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Mathew ne photo bheja hai - 
inhone banaya hai

273
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,501
Bahut achcha design kiya hai, Shri Mataji.
Design bahut khoobsurat kiya hai.

274
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,336
- Yeh log
- Yahan pe ek yeh karke aur

275
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,906
- Bahut achcha
- Bahut achcha design kiya hai.
Lag hi nahin raha hai

276
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:31,626
- Haath idhar nikal raha hai, udhar
- Yeh, yes, yes - beautiful! Graphic sense

277
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:36,556
- The starting process [UNCLEAR]
- Very nice! Very attractive!

278
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:42,382
They stand out so as soon as you put the first
lot, people come and look - Very attractive!

279
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:47,599
- Very nice!
- So, so many people [UNCLEAR] saw the person

280
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,400
- Can we have take one of both?
- Yes

281
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,793
- There're some Chinese people [UNCLEAR]
- Very creative and just see

282
00:23:55,793 --> 00:24:00,050
this lotus also done so well! 
Everything very nice.

283
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:13,556
- Every time something new.
- [UNCLEAR] also transform

284
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:17,348
Sahaja to [UNCLEAR] that will know us.

285
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:24,704
Tremendous! I was telling him, "He's a
very big find, Albert," because first time

286
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,865
- when I came, nobody to speak Mandarin even
- Hmm

287
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:30,065
- such a problem!
- Big problem

288
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:37,989
Nobody to translate it - Mandarin. Then 
they said,"We no." They said, Cantonese

289
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:41,683
they had some body but not
Mandarin. They said, "No."

290
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:44,303
- You must know Cantonese, I think, here.
- Yes

291
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:46,344
- You speak Cantonese?
- Yes, we speak Cantonese.

292
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:50,463
So, the Mandarin - there was some body
with Mandarin but no Cantonese.

293
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,466
- Sahaj
- a big problem.
- Yeah

294
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:03,535
Cantonese eat lot of chillies. [LAUGHTER]
I went to Canton

295
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:09,018
and there are mountains of 
chillies, mountains of chillis

296
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:13,984
and that food can be - food is very hot;
Indians would love it.

297
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,194
- Bahut hot hota hai.
- Wahan Sahaja yogis, Shri Mataji

298
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,113
- Annh?
- Wahan Sahaja yogis have given up all this.

299
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:21,850
- Given up now.
- Red chillies.

300
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:24,021
- Ab mircha nahin khate?
- Bilkul nahin. Padti nahin.

301
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:27,504
Padti nahin, padti nahin, Shri Mataji;
Ghar mein nahin hai.

302
00:25:27,796 --> 00:25:31,356
- Ekdam choot gaya kya mircha?
- Bilkul choot gayi, Mataji.

303
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:33,343
To phir khana mein mircha nahin aata hoga?

304
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:35,688
- Aata hai.
- Aata hai

305
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:42,465
Hum to khate hi nahin hai mircha bilkul
bhi shuru se hi; Bahut kam par ab to

306
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:46,198
bilkul hi nahin khate, bilkul nahin.

307
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,820
Waise unhonne mujhe, Dilli mein, Cheen
ka base diya hai kaam karne ke liye.

308
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,890
- Annh?
- Cheen ka kaam karne ko kaha hai.

309
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,890
Cheen? Cheen pe kuch ho hi raha hai.
China is, you see, what happened that,

310
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:07,095
I went with CP to China and he's
Le Ping, the one who is the,

311
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:16,096
he is the Prime Minister. He got very much
interested in Me, asking Me questions on,

312
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,010
about spirituality and but I kept quiet 
because with CP I just don't say everything

313
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:26,371
"Yes, yes," I said this, that and they 
took a photograph of the group, you see

314
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:31,790
and he's also standing next to Me. Now this
photograph was at last with Sahaja yogis

315
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,740
and I didn't know they all had it. So once,
this Le Ping, I think, last year he went to

316
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:46,697
Vienna. So, the people from Vienna took 
that photograph and showed him,

317
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,941
and "Ah, of course I remember Her very
well, where is She this and...?"

318
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:54,631
Then he asked, "How are you concerned,
how do you have this photograph?"

319
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:58,928
So they said, "She's our spiritual
leader." So he was quite surprised,

320
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:01,693
he was very much surprised.
He said, "Really?"

321
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:07,614
Then he said, "Of course, I asked Her but
She never said anything to me but I will

322
00:27:07,614 --> 00:27:13,325
send My cultural Natashe [UNCLEAR] to see
Her," because now he's going back.

323
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:17,628
So the cultural Natashe came, 
very anxious, very respectful.

324
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:21,299
These Chinese are very respectful people. Then he said that,

325
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:28,809
"It's such a honor, Mother, to see You and
this and that," so I gave him realization.

326
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:37,107
He said, "Is this the," - khazaane ko kya
kehte hain angrezi mein?

327
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:44,478
- Treasure
- Treasure - "Is this the treasure of

328
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:51,930
Indian spirituality that we used to know
in China, that India has treasure

329
00:27:52,366 --> 00:27:56,906
of Spirituality - is this the same?"
I said, "Yes, this is the same."

330
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:03,988
He was so impressed. Then he went to 
China, he talked to Li Ping and all that

331
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:09,684
but this old man is still there, you see. So,
he said, "Till he's there,

332
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:16,727
it's rather difficult but once he's finished, 
then we can do something also in China."

333
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:22,095
- About to go, about to go
- About to go - woh mar hi nahin rahe hain

334
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:24,691
- Woh bas
- Mar gaya smajho

335
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:28,656
Yesterday also he took out
some sort of a communicate.

336
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:35,954
- Ho hi jayega khatam
- Zaroor ho jayega ussi time to baat kareinge

337
00:28:35,954 --> 00:28:42,444
Woh to bahut hi badhiya aadmi hai and I 
also told him, this gentleman, that,

338
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:52,068
"Our C-in-C, Mr. Joshian, he's coming to
China, so I hope Le Ping will give him

339
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:57,111
all the due respect and all the due 
consideration because we don't want to have

340
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:05,201
any more wars with China." So, he was
telling Me, our C-in-C

341
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:09,011
was saying that, "I had a red
carpet [UNCLEAR]."

342
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:15,614
They looked after him so well and everything 
was done so well. So, I felt that they are

343
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:21,473
[UNCLEAR] active about it. I'll have to go
and see him - let us see.

344
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:28,212
Yeh mar hi nahin rahe hain - saal bhar ho 
gaya mar rahe hain. For one year he's dying

345
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:34,074
- this Den Dias doesn't die.
- [UNCLEAR] nothing but the stuffed door

346
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:39,405
- That really I don't know, if he's really dead or not.
- Nobody knows, nobody knows.

347
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:42,019
- No one can say
- Because they keep showing

348
00:29:42,037 --> 00:29:45,497
the footage of him in our old channel
very much. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

349
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:49,354
- [UNCLEAR] but he's keeping sick for years
- For years

350
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:55,342
But this is something surprising. One he 
did such a condition, till you step your

351
00:29:55,342 --> 00:30:00,943
at least one foot in the grave, they don't
want to resign, I mean, just...

352
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:03,005
- One and a half, Mother
- Annh?

353
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:07,593
- One and a half
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

354
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:17,646
It's such a attachment! This time we had a
very nice Shiv Puja, very nice for you -

355
00:30:17,646 --> 00:30:22,856
one of the best, I should say. I spoke for
one hour only on one subject, detachment.

356
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:28,099
I said, now next time I'll talk about
other things - now detachment only.

357
00:30:28,124 --> 00:30:33,414
It was very nice Puja, very nice! As a 
result the whole of Japan was frozen.

358
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:37,074
- Wow!
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

359
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:42,734
- To abhi to raheinge aap?
- Ji Mataji

360
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,324
- Program ke lie aaye hain aap?
- Ji Mataji

361
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,299
- Abhi chal na sab jagah.
- Annh?

362
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,819
- Taiwan wagairah aayega saath mein.
- Chaleinge?

363
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,532
- Ji haan
- Chaliye

364
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,229
- Ek hi hafte ki to baat hai.
- Ab aaye hain to ghoom lijiye aap

365
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:58,725
- Aur kya.
- Yahan to abhi 6 tak to hain hi

366
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:01,302
- Annh?
- Yahan 6 tak to hai hiin. Program
ke liye aaye hain

367
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:05,394
- aur 5 Sunday tak hain
- Aap ko dekh kar bade mann khush hota hai

368
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,050
Ek to Mujhe iska laga hota hai na, ye jo
kar rahe hain Madras mein

369
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,731
- batayiye, sahaja yog ke naam se
- Nahin isko, isko to dekh

370
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:17,706
Aapki dosti hai to badi achchi baat hai.
Phone number hai aapke paas?

371
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:22,178
Hai Shri Mataji - yahan nahin hai, Mahila
mein hai. Isko wahan ja kar poochna padega

372
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:25,315
- Wahan se karte hain [UNCLEAR]
- Bade dusht log hain

373
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:29,103
- Ya to phir jinko pehle kaha tha Dilli mein
- Haan

374
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:32,538
- unko phir se phone karte hain aur...
- Aur unko bhi keh do.

375
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:36,604
- Unko bhi kehte hain. Dono ko kehte hain
- Phir Hum Jayakar se na kahein - don't need

376
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:41,823
Zaroorat nahin hai - Jinse pehle kaha tha
Dilli mein, wojo Enforcement mein hain

377
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:44,372
- Sab chupke chupke kaam kiya
- Woh Enforcement mein jo hain

378
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:47,269
unko main bata doonga ki [UNCLEAR]
purana jaante hain

379
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:50,962
Finance mein hain to lucky mein hain,
I mean, it is about Finance only.

380
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:53,653
Ji haan, yeh ho jayega. Yeh IAS mein
hain - ho jayega.

381
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:58,131
Unke peeche lagna chahiye. Police lagani
chahiye, pata karna chahiye kahan jaate

382
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:01,715
hain, kisse milte hain. Par yahan to ho
gaye - pakad mein aa gaye, bhaag gaye

383
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:04,579
Yahan se bhaag gaye - wahan se bhi ho
jayega, bilkul ho jayega.

384
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:08,627
Unko jaana tha 18 ko, woh
13 hi ko bhaag gaye.

385
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:18,530
- Ab, Shri Mataji, izaazat dein
- Achcha theek hai

386
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,211
- 12 bajne waale hain
- Achcha

387
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:24,513
- Jai Shri Mataji
- Good night, good night.

388
00:32:28,236 --> 00:32:40,176
[ALL DO PRANAMS TO SHRI MATAJI]

389
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:47,684
May God bless you! All of you. Theek hai

390
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:59,712
Wow, very good, excellent. Alright, let's 
see. I hope the hall will be sufficient

391
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,926
- I would like
- They have a capacity of three thousand.

392
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:09,027
Wow! [ALL LAUGH]

393
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:14,548
Just to give a desire there, we have to 
have, desire for [UNCLEAR]

394
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:21,154
I think, you know, it's more advertising 
that works, really. It's only advertising

395
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:27,496
In, what they did, in Sydney, was nothing
but advertising - that clicked.

396
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:33,996
We've done a lot of magazine advertising,
in the newspapers...

397
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:36,441
- That's it!
- we've done a lot.

398
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:41,352
It's a very big force, these days
- advertise

399
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:48,011
We had a merely, a 4000 people in Mao,
