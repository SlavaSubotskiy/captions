1
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:36,260
Today we have assembled here to do the Kundalini Puja

2
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,420
Once we had done it in India long, long time back

3
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:50,851
and this is the first time we are doing this puja here in Austria

4
00:00:56,132 --> 00:01:03,989
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini, is the Primordial Kundalini

5
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:16,580
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,

6
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,826
who is the Primordial Mother,

7
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:29,780
there is a power which is a snake in the left hand.

8
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:57,035
And the Primordial Mother has one of Her powers,

9
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,300
which we can say, as the Primordial Kundalini,

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,740
is a part of Her.

11
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,020
Of course, She's beyond that,

12
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,278
but She is reflected in human beings

13
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,452
as the Kundalini.

14
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,275
Now one has to know that to create an Incarnation,

15
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,322
a lot of work has gone into.

16
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:43,740
So many things had to be envisaged.

17
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,657
One had to have the vision that,

18
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,555
when a human being is created,

19
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:01,109
how an Incarnation can help him.

20
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,283
At different levels, we had Incarnations on this Earth

21
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,540
and they were sent with a particular idea

22
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,580
that they should achieve a particular type of ascent

23
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:26,100
in that particular time.

24
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,580
They were all part and parcel of the Primordial Mother.

25
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:44,740
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini built within them.

26
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:57,709
But the Incarnation of this Kali Yuga is very complicated.

27
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,460
First it had to be worked out what will be the situation

28
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,029
in which this Incarnation would be born

29
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:19,546
and what sort of encounters this Incarnation would have.

30
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:35,210
So, the major propelling force, you can say,

31
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:42,540
the major work had to be done in the Incarnation

32
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,300
to create a very strong spinal cord,

33
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:58,180
so that it could bear the Primordial Kundalini,

34
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:10,025
which is responsible for doing this great work of transformation.

35
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,030
Now, this Kundalini, which is the Primordial One,

36
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:33,420
has all the powers built in:

37
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,386
of redemption, of ascent.

38
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:55,250
But apart from that, to be born in this Kali Yuga,

39
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:05,954
one had to know what sort of people one has to face

40
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:13,220
and then how to bring them round

41
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,300
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

42
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,745
and to the understanding that they have to have their ascent.

43
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:40,809
So, there are many sources of energies and knowledge,

44
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:50,459
which are to be used because it's a very complicated world

45
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:54,724
in which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

46
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,620
It was not a simple thing like people coming to Himalayas.

47
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,649
They were already clean people,

48
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,289
very desirous of getting realization.

49
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,500
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions and conditions and ego.

50
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,180
They were completely surrendered

51
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,740
and after a great amount of penance, they would arrive.

52
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,619
So to raise their Kundalini was not such a complicated thing.

53
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:36,469
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini

54
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,914
had to give ascent to people,

55
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:44,354
but She had to also understand

56
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,900
what sort of people are there.

57
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,820
Why don't she take out the child? What's the matter?

58
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,531
I think, open the windows, perhaps the children are feeling hot.

59
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,140
Normally children don't cry unless and until there is some problem,

60
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,260
You have to be careful.

61
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,012
So, all the aspects of human beings on the random

62
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,935
movement of human beings,

63
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,551
all their adventures and enterprises,

64
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,116
were to be understood

65
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,940
by the Incarnation,

66
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:44,180
to communicate with the Primordial Kundalini.

67
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,820
And also such a person had to be a Mahamaya

68
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,900
so that She or He, whatever it is,

69
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,000
has to behave in such a manner

70
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,520
that nobody should feel frightened

71
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:14,780
or should feel something disturbed.

72
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,700
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

73
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,596
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double-fold.

74
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,053
First is to know about the present:

75
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,707
the way the people are,

76
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:42,420
their cultures, their styles, their conditionings, their egos, everything,

77
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,980
how they behave.

78
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,891
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all these things

79
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:52,450
because She doesn't know. This is human adventure.

80
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,650
She doesn't know how far they have gone

81
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,860
and what do they see, what do they dream, what are their ideas.

82
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:05,220
And the another work is of the Kundalini.

83
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,620
So She's divided into two parts:

84
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,377
one is the Kundalini and another is the Sahasrara.

85
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,820
So, Sahasrara has to supply all the material,

86
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,234
all the information to the Kundalini

87
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,260
and then the Kundalini has to work out.

88
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,980
Of course, as you know very well,

89
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,180
there are Deities who are built in

90
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:37,795
everywhere in the Sahasrara, also the whole body

91
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,500
and they are the Ones who communicate

92
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,140
whatever has to be communicated properly.

93
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,065
But it's a very complicated work, extremely complicated.

94
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,404
So this Primordial Kundalini

95
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:57,004
acts for

96
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,179
the collective,  Samashti, as well as for the individual.

97
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,180
 Now, supposing you go to

98
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,620
a place like, say, an airport.

99
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,140
So you start absorbing the heat of the people.

100
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,820
Then the perspiration starts and you

101
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,340
have to see that all this work is done through your body.

102
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,100
Or, at the same time, if there's somebody, individual

103
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,660
who has some problem also can be absorbed

104
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,940
and can be corrected.

105
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,780
So, it acts on both levels

106
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,140
one on the individual and one on the collective, as they say

107
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,952
Samashti and Vyashti.

108
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,444
 And simultaneously this can act.

109
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:08,860
Now the attention, which is the power of the sahasrara,

110
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,660
  also has to be extremely deep, alert

111
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,620
and intelligible.

112
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,140
All this work had to be done to create

113
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,746
this Incarnation of Primordial Kundalini and the Sahasrara.

114
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:50,933
so many mechanism were used,

115
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:55,700
so many types of wiring was done, as you do it,

116
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,820
like as you try to fix your computer to make it the most efficient one,

117
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,540
in the same way, lot of work was to be put in.

118
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:21,780
And first you had to watch human beings for two thousand years,

119
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,540
how they have been behaving, what they have been doing

120
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,020
and now what sort of human beings are there.

121
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,159
Every nation had different conditionings.

122
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,802
Every individual had different conditioning. It's a very difficult work

123
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,091
and One had to have really the ocean of patience,

124
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,860
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

125
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,220
And that's how

126
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,980
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage was set in.

127
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,260
As you have put the stage here, you have done a marvellous work

128
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,700
and it looks very nice, beautiful, everything is there,

129
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,340
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very complicated one,

130
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,140
extremely complicated.

131
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,700
Because the work was so dynamic,

132
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:46,124
so subtle, at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

133
00:15:53,116 --> 00:16:02,676
All the intelligence of the Divine was used

134
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,780
to manufacture this Incarnation.

135
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:22,180
And to get a human realization was also very difficult.

136
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,900
You had to be born like an ordinary human being,

137
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,489
to live in your family like an ordinary person.

138
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,380
You had to find out through entering into everybody's Kundalini

139
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,650
what was wrong with them,

140
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,420
what was the mistake,

141
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,620
how you could use the permutations and combinations

142
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,740
of their chakras to give them en-masse realization.

143
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:53,511
 It was a tremendous task

144
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:58,446
and that had to be done with the Sahasrara.

145
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,786
But it has been achieved.

146
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:14,740
All these great plans of the Divine

147
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:20,658
and everybody's detailed working

148
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:30,020
and bringing everything to a par-excellence level

149
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,139
was really tremendous.

150
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:36,284
I'm Myself surprised at Myself

151
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,774
and amazed

152
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:47,891
how I could really get so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,780
I didn't expect it,

154
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
but it has worked tremendously,

155
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,140
because of the co-operation of human beings also,

156
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,140
otherwise it would not have been possible.

157
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,820
Now, when you do these pujas and all those things,

158
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,460
you please those Deities, make them happy,

159
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,740
because they have done so much work.

160
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,340
Is your gratitude for them

161
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:31,940
that they have worked so hard with such diligence,

162
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,700
with such precisions

163
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,340
that today we have been able to achieve this great drama

164
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,780
of Sahaja Yoga.

165
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,240
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps do not realize

166
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,020
what is the great work done in the background

167
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,980
and how much time it took to build up the wholething,

168
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,980
to bring it to this level of perfection.

169
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,460
So the Primordial Kundalini,

170
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,859
which is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

171
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,399
also is of the same nature

172
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,620
and it works in the same way.

173
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,860
It rises, gives you Self Realization,

174
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,020
gives you the powers,

175
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,349
but after all one has to know it is a reflection

176
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,932
and a reflection to make it truthful, real.

177
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:59,231
You have to look at reality first,

178
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,380
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

179
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,500
the real Primordial One,

180
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,527
how it acts, how it works.

181
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,235
If you start thinking about My Kundalini only,

182
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:22,500
immediately you will become silent, no question.

183
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,060
You cannot think, just you'll become silent.

184
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,220
Just think of any one of My chakras

185
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,940
and your chakras will be all right.

186
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,501
But you have to have that depth.

187
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,852
You have to have that much protocol.

188
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,660
You have to have that much right.

189
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,500
Just it will act. Don't have to do anything.

190
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,500
Just you have to think of My chakras.

191
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,020
Just think about My Kundalini. That's sufficient.

192
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,540
But you have to develop that surrendering situation.

193
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,140
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

194
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,620
They have seen the work, they have seen everything, still they doubt

195
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,980
and they yield to people who are on the periphery.

196
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,820
And there are Sahaja Yogis who still

197
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,140
sticking on to many things they cannot change. They haven't got

198
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,126
yet that courage to change themselves.

199
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,612
I don't say that you have to change anything outside,

200
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:27,980
but a time comes you might have to change also,

201
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,140
so you should be prepared.

202
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,660
How much we are courageous, that is to be weighed

203
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,492
and to be found out

204
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,300
Unless and until you have full courage,

205
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,980
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga in a quick way.

206
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,500
When you are using your own Kundalini,

207
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,620
you have to know that the Kundalini that is your own has problems.

208
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,780
She Herself has gone through various ages and stages

209
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,620
and She Herself is sometimes very much hurt,

210
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,060
very unhappy and very weak and then She cannot rise.

211
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,300
So, if you want that this Kundalini

212
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,980
that is your own,that is your own Mother

213
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,340
has to give you all the nourishment and everything,

214
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,618
you must learn, first of all,

215
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:29,720
foremost thing, how to surrender to Reality.

216
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:36,420
So, if you learn how to surrender to the Primordial Kundalini,

217
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,993
then your Kundalini's immediately strengthened.

218
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,140
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

219
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:53,340
and you try to put anything on it, it won't reflect.

220
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:59,060
Then you improve with the wood, still nothing will be reflected.

221
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,300
Then you paint it, some reflection will come.

222
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,700
Then you have the glass. The glass won't reflect.

223
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,140
But if you use some mercury and make it a mirror, it will reflect,

224
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,060
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

225
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,660
So this is how the kind of a reflector you are,

226
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,100
on that depends the kind of a reflection you get

227
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,980
and the kind of personality you develop.

228
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,065
So, there should be no aim as such, but

229
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:39,380
to be dissolved into the Reality,

230
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,619
should be the desire within you.

231
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,180
Start dissolving into it.

232
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,340
Then one does not have to talk about detachment.

233
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,780
One does not have to talk about anything, about any virtues.

234
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,700
They automatically come because now you have become the Divine.

235
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,420
Once you become the Divine, even your Kundalini becomes absolutely,

236
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:09,122
beautifully, completely reflecting the Primordial One.

237
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,380
So, today I have decided to have this puja

238
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,300
and to tell you about this Primordial Kundalini how

239
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,108
it has been worked out, it has been built in and it has

240
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:28,308
been given so many powers

241
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,660
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

242
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,060
people had to cleanse their chakras, cleanse their

243
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,140
body, cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,

244
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,820
tapas and then they would think of having realization.

245
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,140
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

246
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,580
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done any tapas, nothing.

247
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,820
From the very first day you have been blessed

248
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,684
and you have had blessings

249
00:24:58,884 --> 00:25:02,260
and you have been enjoying your blessings throughout.

250
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,380
So that is a temptation. Remember it's a temptation.

251
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,700
Don't get lost with the blessings that you are having.

252
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,620
You have to go further and further and further.

253
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,420
So, it's not a difficult life in Sahaja Yoga at all.

254
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,180
On the contrary, it's very much easier,

255
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,460
but then people start using Sahaja Yoga for certain purposes

256
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,140
which secretly they know

257
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,580
that they are using Sahaja Yoga for this purpose and that purpose.

258
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,780
If you start using Sahaja Yoga for any such purpose,

259
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,834
then again you have a fall,

260
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,660
then again you have to understand that this was a wrong thing

261
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,260
and then again you rise.

262
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,500
So people go like this, up and down, up and down, up and down.

263
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,907
But still, I must say, this realization that is given to you

264
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:51,180
has been given without cleansing you,

265
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,700
without telling you anything, without asking for anything,

266
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:03,659
without any kind  of bondage on you, burden on you

267
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:06,540
and you got this realization.

268
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,340
But now, immediately after Realization, you are in the bondage

269
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,900
of your Kundalini

270
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,603
and you have to look after Her and you have to look after yourself.

271
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:23,620
Now you have to identify yourself fully with your Kundalini

272
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,540
and then everything works out all right.

273
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,540
So, today is the day when we have to decide

274
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,180
that our greatest weapon as Austria is Astra,

275
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
is Kundalini.

276
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,340
And we should know how to use it,

277
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,820
what mantra's to be used,

278
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,500
what is the problem we have

279
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,060
and we should not be shy of our problem. If we have a problem,

280
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,100
we should know this is our problem, it must be corrected.

281
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:58,804
Also we should know the technique fully.

282
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:02,940
I find that some people knows lot of techniques

283
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,660
and also they know how to give big speeches,

284
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,370
but they are not good in their hearts.

285
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,140
The hearts are not clean.

286
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,811
They want to use their power of speech just to show off

287
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,780
their knowledge.

288
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,539
Then there are some people who are, who are such

289
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:27,300
that they are good in vibrations and they want to give vibrations,

290
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,540
but they are afraid and they don't know much about the technique.

291
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,060
So, you have to know all these three things properly,

292
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,020
f you really want to achieve full results of your ascent

293
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,235
and if you want to really transform the world,

294
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:46,140
then you must know you have to be ideal people.

295
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,140
You cannot be problematic people. Now see, yesterday I was surprised

296
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,067
how many people there were sick,

297
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:57,387
how many people were suffering from this or that.

298
00:27:57,611 --> 00:28:01,020
While you should thank your stars that none of you have any sickness,

299
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,835
you are perfectly all right, you don't have bad habits,

300
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:06,700
you don't have anything. You've just come out of it.

301
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,140
But to go further, you have to have full determination

302
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,660
and understanding that this is a tremendous work

303
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,588
and a tremendous task.

304
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:18,595
And all your powers to be awakened within yourself,

305
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,060
you have to be first of all

306
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,820
fully equipped with readiness,

307
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,739
readiness to serve the Divine.

308
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,699
Unless and until you have that readiness,

309
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:37,140
that: "I don't want anything. I don't want. I just want to serve the Divine.”

310
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,483
As long as

311
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:43,700
you are striving for it and asking for it

312
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,740
with full heart, with full sincerity,

313
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,980
then I'm sure this Kundalini will be strengthened

314
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,220
and She'll cleanse you completely

315
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,620
and you'll be one day Mahayogis.

316
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:59,401
May God bless you all.
