1
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:36,260
Today we have assembled here to do 
the Kundalini Puja.

2
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:41,377
Once we had done it in India long, long
time back

3
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:50,991
and this is the first time we are doing
this puja here in Austria.

4
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:04,194
This is the puja of the Adi Kundalini,
is the Primordial Kundalini.

5
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,451
[Shri Mataji speaks aside, “Can you just
put it off?”]

6
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:19,775
You must have seen in the hand of Athena,
who is the Primordial Mother,

7
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:31,217
there is a power which is a snake
in the left hand.

8
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:33,497
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: “Put it away.

9
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:38,192
It’s all right, little far away if you
keep it, it’s all right.

10
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:42,465
Yes, little that side it’s all right”.]

11
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:58,546
And the Primordial Mother has one
of Her powers,

12
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:07,740
which we can say, as the Primordial
Kundalini, is a part of Her.

13
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,796
Of course, She's beyond that, but She
is reflected in human beings

14
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:22,761
as the Kundalini.

15
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,958
Now one has to know that to create
an incarnation,

16
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:34,853
lot of work has gone into.

17
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:43,691
So many things had to be envisaged.

18
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:55,884
One had to have the vision that, when
a human being is created,

19
00:02:57,282 --> 00:03:01,931
how an incarnation can help him.

20
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:09,755
At different levels, we had incarnations
on this Earth,

21
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:15,699
and they were sent with a particular idea

22
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:26,815
that they should achieve a particular type
of ascent in that particular time.

23
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:34,028
They were all part and parcel
of the Primordial Mother

24
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:44,783
And they all had a very powerful Kundalini
built within them.

25
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:58,370
But the incarnation of this Kali Yuga
is very complicated.

26
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:05,795
First it had to be worked out what will be
the situation

27
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,500
in which this incarnation would be born

28
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:20,297
and what sort of encounters this
incarnation would have.

29
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:35,214
So, the major propelling force, you can
say,

30
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:42,484
or the major work had to be done
in the incarnation

31
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:50,339
to create a very strong spinal cord,

32
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:58,322
so that it could bear the Primordial
Kundalini,

33
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:10,874
which is responsible for doing this great
work of transformation.

34
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:20,415
Now, this Kundalini, which is
the primordial one,

35
00:05:21,384 --> 00:05:42,407
has all the powers built-in of redemption,
of ascent.

36
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:55,833
But apart from that, to be born in this
Kali Yuga,

37
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:06,367
One had to know what sort of people
One has to face

38
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:17,411
and then how to bring them round
to the understanding of Sahaja Yoga

39
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:23,274
and to the understanding that they have
to have their ascent.

40
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:46,499
So, there are many sources of energies
and knowledge which are to be used

41
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:54,819
because it's a very complicated world in
which the Primordial Kundalini had to work.

42
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,620
It was not a simple thing like people
coming to Himalayas.

43
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:07,366
They were already clean people, very
desirous of getting Realization.

44
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:15,740
They didn't have all kinds of inhibitions
and conditions and ego.

45
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:22,545
They were completely surrendered and
after a great amount of penance,

46
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,740
they would arrive.

47
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:29,833
So to raise their Kundalini was not such
a complicated thing.

48
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:38,777
So, not only that, the Primordial Kundalini
had to give ascent to people,

49
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:49,953
but She had to also understand what
sort of people are there.

50
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:58,143
Why don’t you take out the child?
What’s the matter?

51
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:07,258
I think, open the windows, perhaps
the children are feeling hot.

52
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:01,249
Normally children don’t cry unless and
until there is some problem, you see.

53
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,379
You have to be careful.

54
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:19,051
So, all the aspects of human beings on
the random movement of human beings,

55
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:33,277
all their adventures and enterprises,
were to be understood by the incarnation,

56
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:45,225
to communicate with the Primordial
Kundalini.

57
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:51,750
And also, such a person had to be
a Mahamaya

58
00:09:51,951 --> 00:10:01,965
so that She or He, whatever it is, has
to behave in such a manner

59
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:15,751
that nobody should feel frightened
or should feel something distant.

60
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:20,699
So this Mahamaya Swarupa had to be taken.

61
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:28,659
So, the Adi Shakti's work is double fold.

62
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,643
First is to know about the present:
the way the people are,

63
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:42,357
their cultures, their styles, their
conditionings, their egos, everything,

64
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,035
how they behave.

65
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:49,697
Though the Adi Shakti is unaware of all
these things because She doesn’t know -

66
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:56,731
this is human adventure. She doesn't know
how far they have gone

67
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:02,222
and what do they see, what do they dream,
what are their ideas.

68
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:08,564
And the another work is of the Kundalini.
So She is divided into two parts.

69
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:14,821
One is the Kundalini and another
is the Sahasrara.

70
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,112
So [the] Sahasrara has to supply
all the material,

71
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:28,195
all the information to the Kundalini and
then the Kundalini has to work out.

72
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:33,102
Of course, as you know very well, there
are deities who are built-in

73
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:37,811
everywhere in the Sahasrara also,
in the whole body,

74
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:44,140
and they are the ones who communicate
whatever has to be communicated properly,

75
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,001
but it’s a very complicated work, extremely
complicated.

76
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:59,089
So this Primordial Kundalini acts for
the collective, Samashti,

77
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,779
as well as for the individual.

78
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,099
Now supposing you go to a place like,
say, an airport.

79
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,244
So you start absorbing the heat
of the people.

80
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:21,462
Then the perspiration starts and you have
to see

81
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:27,228
that all this work is done through
your body.

82
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:33,935
Or, at the same time, if there’s somebody,
individual, who has some problem,

83
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:42,829
also can be absorbed and can be corrected.

84
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,746
So, it acts on both the levels – one on
the individual and one on the collective,

85
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:54,093
as they say samashti and vyashti.

86
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:58,977
And simultaneously this can act.

87
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:05,902
Now the attention, which is the power
of the brain,

88
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:13,222
we can say, or power of Sahasrara, also
has to be

89
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:24,682
extremely deep, alert and intelligible.

90
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:33,127
All this work had to be done to create

91
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:39,587
this incarnation of Primordial Kundalini
and the Sahasrara.

92
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:55,667
So many mechanisms were used. So many
types of wiring were done, as you do it,

93
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:00,819
like as you try to fix your computer
to make it the most efficient one,

94
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,885
in the same way, a lot of work was to be
put in.

95
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:22,387
And first You had to watch human beings
for two thousand years,

96
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:26,508
how they have been behaving, what they
have been doing

97
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:31,450
and now what sort of human beings are
there.

98
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:37,443
Every nation had different conditionings.

99
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,135
Every individual had different
conditioning.

100
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:48,025
It's a very difficult work and One had
to have really the ocean of patience,

101
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:52,610
inexhaustible ocean of patience.

102
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:56,171
And that's how

103
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,915
this work of Sahaja Yoga, the whole stage
was set in.

104
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:10,196
As you have put the stage here, you have
done a marvellous work

105
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:17,780
and it looks very nice, beautiful,
everything is there.

106
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:28,897
but the stage for Sahaja Yoga was a very
complicated one, extremely complicated.

107
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,089
Because the work was so dynamic, so subtle,

108
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:47,325
at the same time so loving, so affectionate.

109
00:15:53,084 --> 00:16:08,499
All the intelligence of the Divine was used
to manufacture this incarnation.

110
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:22,124
And to get a human Realization was also
very difficult.

111
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,866
You had to be born like an ordinary human
being,

112
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,456
to live in your family like an ordinary
person.

113
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:34,315
You had to find out through entering
into everybody's Kundalini

114
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:40,350
what was wrong with them, what
was the mistake,

115
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:45,602
how you could use the permutations
and combinations

116
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:50,779
of their chakras to give them en masse
Realization.

117
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:58,274
It was a tremendous task and that had to be
done with the Sahasrara.

118
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,738
But it has been achieved.

119
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:20,897
All these great plans of the Divine
and everybody's detailed working

120
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:32,139
and bringing everything to a par excellence
level was really tremendous.

121
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:40,040
I'm Myself surprised at Myself and amazed

122
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:49,253
how I could really get so many people
in Sahaja Yoga.

123
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,008
I didn't expect it,

124
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:02,025
but it has worked tremendously, because
of the cooperation of human beings also,

125
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:06,186
otherwise it would not have been possible.

126
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:13,707
Now when you do these pujas and
all those things,

127
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:22,761
you please those deities, make them happy
because they have done so much work.

128
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:29,597
Is your gratitude for them that they have
worked so hard

129
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:34,699
with such diligence, with such precisions

130
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:42,392
that today we have been able to achieve
this great drama of Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:47,315
Those who are Sahaja Yogis perhaps
do not realize

132
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:52,355
what is the great work done in
the background

133
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:58,988
and how much time it took to build up
the whole thing,

134
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:03,926
to bring it to this level of perfection.

135
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:15,778
So the Primordial Kundalini, which
is reflected in you as your Kundalini,

136
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:24,848
also is of the same nature and it works
in the same way.

137
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:34,852
It rises, gives you Self Realization,
gives you the powers,

138
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:43,773
but, after all, one has to know it is
a reflection.

139
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:53,011
and a reflection to make it truthful, real,

140
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,926
you have to look at reality first,

141
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:08,264
how the real One, the real Kundalini,

142
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:14,915
the real Primordial One, how it acts, 
how it works.

143
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:18,178
If you start thinking about My Kundalini
only,

144
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:22,444
immediately you will become silent,
no question.

145
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:27,059
You cannot think, just you'll become
silent.

146
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,955
Just think of any one of My chakras
and your chakras will be all right.

147
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:39,852
But you have to have that depth. You have
to have that much protocol.

148
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:44,502
You have to have that much right. 
Just it will act.

149
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,360
Don't have to do anything. Just you have
to think of My chakras.

150
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:53,949
Just think about My Kundalini. That's
sufficient.

151
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,540
But you have to develop that surrendering
situation.

152
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,110
Even now there are Sahaja Yogis who doubt.

153
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,558
They have seen the work, they have seen
everything, still they doubt,

154
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,906
and they yield to people who are
on the periphery.

155
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:14,435
And there are Sahaja Yogis who [are]
still sticking on to many things.

156
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:20,278
They cannot change. They haven’t got yet
that courage to change themselves.

157
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,524
I don't say that you have to change
anything outside,

158
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:30,046
but a time comes you might have to change
also, so you should be prepared.

159
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:36,587
How much we are courageous, that is to be
weighed and to be found out.

160
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:40,228
Unless and until you have full courage,

161
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:47,378
you cannot establish Sahaja Yoga
in a quick way.

162
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,988
When you are using your own Kundalini,
you have to know

163
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:58,179
that the Kundalini that is your own has
problems.

164
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,779
She Herself has gone through various ages
and stages

165
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,620
and She Herself is sometimes very much
hurt,

166
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,964
very unhappy and very weak, and then
She cannot rise.

167
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:19,908
So if you want that this Kundalini that is
your own, that is your own mother

168
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,370
has to give you all the nourishment and
everything,

169
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:30,290
you must learn, first of all, foremost
thing, how to surrender to reality.

170
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:36,587
So, if you learn how to surrender
to the Primordial Kundalini,

171
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,147
then your Kundalini's immediately
strengthened.

172
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:45,067
It's like this, supposing you have a stone

173
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:53,802
and you try to put anything on it,
it won't reflect.

174
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:59,003
Then you improve with the wood, still
nothing will be reflected.

175
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:02,299
Then you paint it, some reflection will
come.

176
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,700
Then you have the glass. The glass won't
reflect.

177
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:11,113
But if you use some mercury and make it
a mirror, it will reflect,

178
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:13,981
but still it may not be the perfect mirror.

179
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:18,660
So this is how the kind of a reflector
you are,

180
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:23,015
on that depends the kind of a reflection
you get

181
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:26,931
and the kind of personality you develop.

182
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:39,326
So there should be no aim as such but
to be dissolved into the reality,

183
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:46,147
should be the desire within you. To start
dissolving into it.

184
00:23:46,348 --> 00:23:49,308
Then one does not have to talk about
detachment.

185
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:53,749
One does not have to talk about anything,
about any virtues.

186
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,644
They automatically come because now
you have become the Divine.

187
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:01,698
Once you become the Divine, even your
Kundalini becomes

188
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:09,258
absolutely, beautifully, completely
reflecting the Primordial One.

189
00:24:09,459 --> 00:24:12,336
So today I had decided to have this puja

190
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:15,032
and to tell you about this Primordial
Kundalini,

191
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:19,767
how it has been worked out,
it has been built in

192
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:28,353
and it has been given so many powers.

193
00:24:30,756 --> 00:24:34,635
Formerly, before this kind of Sahaja Yoga,

194
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:38,806
people had to cleanse their chakras,
cleanse their body,

195
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,607
cleanse their mind, do all kinds of things,
tapas

196
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:46,762
and then they would think of having
Realization.

197
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:50,069
Even Mahavira did twelve years of tapas,

198
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,540
while in Sahaja Yoga none of you have done
any tapas, nothing.

199
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:58,646
From the very first day you have been
blessed and you have had blessings

200
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:02,196
and you have been enjoying your blessings
throughout.

201
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:07,380
So that is a temptation. Remember
it's a temptation.

202
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,699
Don't get lost with the blessings that
you are having.

203
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,620
You have to go further and further
and further.

204
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,285
So it's not a difficult life in Sahaja
Yoga, at all.

205
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:21,796
On the contrary, it’s very much easier.
But then people start using Sahaja Yoga

206
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:25,065
for certain purposes which secretly they
know

207
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:28,580
that they are using Sahaj Yoga for this
purpose and that purpose.

208
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:34,733
If you start using Sahaj Yoga for any such
purpose, then again you have a fall,

209
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:39,174
then again you have to understand that this
was a wrong thing and then again you rise.

210
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:43,509
So people go like this, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

211
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,986
But still, I must say, this Realization
that is given to you, has been given

212
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:55,640
without cleansing you, without telling you
anything, without asking for anything,

213
00:25:55,854 --> 00:26:06,522
without any kind of bondage on you, bandhan
on you, and you got this Realisation.

214
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:15,911
But now, immediately after Realization,
you are in the bondage of your Kundalini

215
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:19,519
and you have to look after Her and you have
to look after yourself.

216
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,565
Now you have to identify yourself fully
with your Kundalini

217
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:26,441
and then everything works out all right.

218
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:30,539
So today is the day when we have to decide

219
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,380
that our greatest weapon as Austria
is Astra, is Kundalini

220
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:43,820
and we should know how to use it,
what mantras to be used,

221
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,485
what is the problem we have and we should
not be shy of our problem.

222
00:26:49,694 --> 00:26:55,387
If we have a problem, we should know
this is our problem, it must be corrected.

223
00:26:55,588 --> 00:26:58,761
Also, we should know the technique fully.

224
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:02,837
I find that some people know lot
of techniques

225
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,610
and also they know how to give big
speeches,

226
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:11,013
but they are not good in their hearts.
Their hearts are not clean.

227
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:17,780
They want to use their power of speech
just to show off their knowledge.

228
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:22,502
Then there are some people who are –
who are such

229
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,273
that they are good in vibrations and they
want to give vibrations,

230
00:27:27,474 --> 00:27:31,423
but they are afraid, and they don't know
much about the technique.

231
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:34,951
So you have to know all these three things
properly,

232
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:39,905
if you really want to achieve full results
of your ascent.

233
00:27:40,106 --> 00:27:43,159
And if you want really to transform
the world,

234
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,898
then you must know you have to be ideal
people. You cannot be problematic people.

235
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:53,046
Now see, yesterday I was surprised
how many people there were sick,

236
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:57,312
how many people were suffering from this
or that.

237
00:27:57,513 --> 00:28:00,962
While you should thank your stars that none
of you have any sickness,

238
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,783
you are perfectly all right, you don't have
bad habits,

239
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:06,644
you don't have anything. You have just
come out of it.

240
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:11,311
But to go further, you have to have full
determination and understanding

241
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:15,403
that this is a tremendous work and
a tremendous task

242
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:18,522
and all your powers to be awakened
within yourself,

243
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:25,819
you have to be, first of all, fully
equipped with readiness,

244
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:32,655
readiness to serve the Divine. Unless
and until you have that readiness,

245
00:28:32,856 --> 00:28:37,063
that, "I don't want anything. I don't want.
I just want to serve the Divine.”

246
00:28:37,264 --> 00:28:45,641
As long as you are striving for it and
asking for it with full heart,

247
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:50,948
with full sincerity, then I’m sure this
Kundalini will be strengthened

248
00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:55,504
and She'll cleanse you completely and
you'll be one day Mahayogis.

249
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:58,869
May God bless you all.
