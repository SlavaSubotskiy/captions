1
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:42,180
Merry Christmas and all the blessings for 
the next year.

2
00:00:42,180 --> 00:01:01,280
Today we are

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:03:40,900
not going to

4
00:03:40,900 --> 00:04:00,430
have

5
00:04:00,430 --> 00:06:20,629
a very long puja, but there are certain things 
which we have to understand from the life

6
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,360
of Christ.

7
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:40,319
Christ was born in a very poor conditions, 
just to show that spirituality can live in

8
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,379
any circumstances and under any problems.

9
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,620
And He had to face so much opposition from 
His own clan.

10
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,850
He was born in a Jew family and that time 
the Jews would not accept Him.

11
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,729
But they did not kill Him, that's the main 
point, we should understand.

12
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,349
They did not kill Him.

13
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,020
Under no law a multitude can kill.

14
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:22,600
Is the judge, who was a Roman judge from the 
Roman Empire who actually ordered His death.

15
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:33,310
It is very difficult to follow His life because 
He was absolutely a Divine personality, absolutely.

16
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,990
And that's why He - whatever rules and regulations 
He has passed for the Christians are really

17
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,820
very difficult to follow, very difficult.

18
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,729
I don't think very few people are even able 
to follow His life.

19
00:07:48,729 --> 00:08:01,039
It's very difficult because He said that if 
you commit any adultery with your eyes, you

20
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,680
better take out.

21
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,419
You cut your hand if you do any crime with 
it.

22
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,330
For Him, the crime was also a very subtle 
thing.

23
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,479
Turn your left cheek if somebody slaps you 
on the right cheek.

24
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,729
To follow this kind of a difficult, very, 
very difficult thing was impossible.

25
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:31,379
And also He said that you have to do it, not 
others.

26
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,600
He lived for such a short time.

27
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,620
He visited India and stayed here.

28
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:44,540
I've read a book about it and I was surprised 
that in the Puranas, is written very clearly

29
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,860
in Sanskrit language, which perhaps the writer 
didn't understand, and where Shalivanha, My

30
00:08:49,860 --> 00:09:01,140
forefathers, he met Him, and he said to Him 
that what is Your name?

31
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:08,459
He said, "My name is Issa Massih", and I have 
come to this country because My country is

32
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:09,850
full of melechas.

33
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,440
Melecha means Mal ich, those have only tendencies 
toward collecting filth.

34
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,529
So he said, "But what are you doing here?

35
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,510
You go back to your own country and teach 
them the "Nirmala Param Tatwam."

36
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,000
It's very surprisingly; he used these words 
so clearly.

37
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,890
So the whole thing was printed in Sanskrit.

38
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,330
Perhaps the writer never understood what was 
in Sanskrit language.

39
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,640
And then he said, "It is - You can only go 
and reform them and You can clear them."

40
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,610
But look at it, He tried to do the good and 
people crucified him.

41
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,910
If you see the Christian religion now, you 
don't know what to say about it.

42
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,940
They have been always opposing Sahaja Yoga 
and also they have never tried to understand

43
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,560
that Christ has said that I will send you 
the Holy Ghost.

44
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,350
Also, some Sahaja Yogis who are supposed to 
be coming from Christian conditionings stick

45
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,350
to that.

46
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,350
Now no more.

47
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,350
There is no Christ.

48
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,990
Of course, we accept that it was very important 
for Him to come on this Earth and to help

49
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
us out.

50
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,529
The steps on which you are, you have to leave 
that step to go out to the higher stage.

51
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,850
That doesn't mean you should not worship Christ.

52
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:39,110
You should worship, but it is not the way 
some people are still very much fond of sticking

53
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,149
on to it.

54
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:56,190
while He is the one who prepared you for Sahaja 
Yoga.

55
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,370
I don't know what you can adapt from His life.

56
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,770
He was the greatest Sahaja Yogi, but He had 
so many powers, which are difficult for human

57
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,730
beings to have.

58
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:21,630
But His sacrifices, His adjustments, acceptance 
of whatever was told to Him, He accepted.

59
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,050
His love for His Mother and on the cross He 
said, "Behold the Mother!", He just said,

60
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,709
"Behold the Mother."

61
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:37,000
Whatever it is, we have to know also that 
the Bible is not completely representing Christ,

62
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,110
as it has happened with every book.

63
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:50,050
So, there are problems and, as in every religion, 
people have gone astray from their right path,

64
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,040
and are spoiling the name of the people who 
have been Divine and who started those religions.

65
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,029
Also is happened in the Christian nation.

66
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:05,680
Just the opposite of what Christ has said, 
they are doing.

67
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:13,610
For us, one has to realize that He came on 
this Earth to open our Agnya chakra, which

68
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,829
is a very difficult thing.

69
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:19,300
Sahasrara is not difficult as Agnya.

70
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:28,570
Agnya chakra is a very constricted chakra 
on which He resides.

71
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:36,270
And He has said, "You have to forgive yourself 
and forgive others."

72
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,980
This is the mantra of the Agnya chakra.

73
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,340
That is in the Beejakshara we call it "Ham 
Sham."

74
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,009
Sham is to forgive others.

75
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,670
Ham is to forgive yourself.

76
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:00,720
These are the two Beejaksharas are used for 
Agnya chakra opening.

77
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,270
To open the Agnya chakra best is to go into 
thoughtless awareness.

78
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,839
To be in thoughtless awareness, Agnya can 
open.

79
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:17,029
But Agnya, if it is closed, it can be very 
dangerous, very dangerous, and can harm you

80
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,880
or harm others.

81
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,390
Sometimes, people who are possessed also get 
those possessions in their Agnya chakra and

82
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:35,089
they'll start acting according to the mutation 
of these horrible, evil forces within them.

83
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:41,769
As a result, these evil forces take over and 
we don't know why such a person is behaving

84
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:43,120
in this manner.

85
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,769
Now, as we know that in America they have 
been doing lots of research, this this genes.

86
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:54,240
They're talking about so many things, which 
they never talked about.

87
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,709
Despite that, all the horrible, terrible diseases 
are coming back with vengeance.

88
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,780
They can't understand why it is happening.

89
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,230
With all this research, with all this work, 
people are getting very sick and it is beyond

90
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,550
them to understand why these things are happening.

91
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:21,379
The main thing is, you have to be under the 
protection of spirituality, under the protection

92
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,300
of morality, under the protection of Divine 
Laws.

93
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:33,230
If you're not under that protection, you can 
get caught up into anything.

94
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,269
America especially, I find, is gone really 
amuck as far as religion is concerned.

95
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:44,480
They have all kinds of religions, they have 
even religions of the devil, religions of

96
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
the witchcraft.

97
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,399
Every sort of religion they have.

98
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,019
Though they have advanced so much in science, 
they are living in terror all the time.

99
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:04,420
Firstly, one must accept, that morality is 
what Christ has taught us, of a very deep

100
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,860
essential nature, very deep.

101
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,529
He said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

102
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,050
Even in the eyes, there should not be adultery.

103
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,209
You look at one woman, all right.

104
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:21,170
Second time, if you look at that woman, then 
you are adulterous.

105
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,350
Such strict rules he has passed about his 
own idea of a moral personality.

106
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:37,260
Now, as you are Sahaja Yogis, you are already 
quite equipped, you are quite equipped and

107
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,580
you can follow His principles easily than 
other people can.

108
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,660
But still, some things I have to tell you, 
as Christ has said that I will tolerate everything

109
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:56,890
against Me, but nothing against the Holy Ghost.

110
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,650
It's very remarkable thing to say.

111
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:04,899
He's the Ocean of Forgiveness, and there He 
says, "Everything I'll tolerate, but nothing

112
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,880
against the Holy Ghost."

113
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:19,540
So many things are happening, So many things 
are happening, which amazes people.

114
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:27,959
For example, here only, in Ganapatipule, there 
was one funny fellow who came up with some

115
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,779
sort of a opposition to Sahaja Yoga.

116
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:42,009
And he got hold of the village man called 
as the Mamlatdar, means he's an officer and

117
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:46,339
both of them combined together started troubling 
us.

118
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,100
Just before our coming ten days, this Mamlatdar 
was suspended.

119
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,459
Nobody could understand.

120
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,459
How was he suspended suddenly?

121
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,459
How?

122
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,459
What happened?

123
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:03,759
Like that - is this is Christ, is His work, 
Ganesha's work.

124
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,220
Left and right, so many people - I, I am not 
bothered about it.

125
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,160
I don't want anybody to be destroyed.

126
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:18,170
But it is They, who are trying to destroy 
all those who come in the way of Sahaja Yoga

127
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:23,819
and it is very amazing how things are happening 
and how it is working out.

128
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,840
So we should have no fear at all, if people 
oppose us, they try to do anything.

129
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,060
Suddenly, you'll find some solution will come 
out and you'll be amazed at it.

130
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:40,570
So many things happen like that and have been 
happening all over and I have so many letters

131
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:48,780
from people saying how they have been helped 
by our Lord Jesus Christ.

132
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,810
I don't have to tell them, they know their 
job very well.

133
00:17:52,810 --> 00:18:02,300
But as Sahaja Yogis, what should we have as 
our code of conduct?

134
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,760
It's very important, as they call "Acharsahita."

135
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,760
The first thing in today's modern Sahaja Yoga, 
you have to know that you have to recognize

136
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,140
Me.

137
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,430
That is very important.

138
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:26,120
Very humbly, I have to tell you - you have 
to recognize Me and you have to respect Me

139
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,740
and love Me.

140
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:40,270
If in these words, if I can explain to you, 
that you cannot have a double life.

141
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,400
You cannot show love and another side you 
try to trouble Me.

142
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:56,410
First thing is that so far there has been 
no en-mass realization, no en-mass realization

143
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,150
and when there is no en-mass realization, 
we cannot blame the people if they did not

144
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:07,930
recognize these incarnations, because without 
realization, how can they recognize?

145
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:17,530
But after en-mass realization, if you do not 
recognize, then it's a serious thing.

146
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:24,950
You should not be addicted to your previous 
nonsensical stuff that you had.

147
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:31,080
In the same, same like some, there are Hindus, 
if I tell them that now finish with all these

148
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:39,380
temples and this fasting and all those brahmic 
nonsense, they don't like it.

149
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
You have to.

150
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,120
Now you have become saints.

151
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,540
For saints, there is no caste, no community, 
no race.

152
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,310
Anyway, and you tell to anyone, they don't 
like it.

153
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,880
If you tell it to Jains, they won't like.

154
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,670
If you tell it to Buddhists, they won't like.

155
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,600
They just want to stick on to the old style 
which their forefather's, their forefather's,

156
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,250
forefathers have been doing so far.

157
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,680
So recognition only mean, doesn't mean that 
you recognize Me as Adi Shakti, but recognition

158
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:26,680
means that in every part of your life, you 
should know that I am with you.

159
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,260
Disciplining in Sahaja Yoga has to be automatic.

160
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:38,780
I don't have to tell you about disciplining, 
but it doesn't work out, then I have to tell

161
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,780
you.

162
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:45,020
The first discipline, is that you have to 
recognize Me and respect Me.

163
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:57,280
Then the second discipline, is you have to 
learn how to be a Sahaja Yogi.

164
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,930
Think of Christ, if He is sitting here, how 
would He behave towards Me or He would behave

165
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:09,210
towards others who are here.

166
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,570
Very difficult for Him to accept all, any 
kind of nonsense from anyone.

167
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,520
He would not tolerate.

168
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,260
I don't mind many things, I say, "All right.

169
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,100
Gradually it will be solved.

170
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,950
Things will be all right."

171
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,390
But what I find, that still there are so many 
Sahaja Yogis who don't really realize the

172
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,270
responsibility that they have.

173
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,830
He carried the cross.

174
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,540
In Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to carry cross.

175
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:47,660
You have to wear only garlands, but you must 
be worthy of garlands.

176
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,520
Nobody has to suffer.

177
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,930
Everything is made very well for them, paved 
with gold as they say, but only thing you

178
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:03,080
should know, how to walk on them.

179
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:10,480
So the second point, as I said, that you should 
not have a double personality.

180
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,790
Single dedication.

181
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:18,590
You need not be twenty-four hours in it, you 
have your own families, your own children,

182
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,730
you have own your life.

183
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:28,080
With that, you have to be all the time connected, 
but not to get so much involved, that you

184
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,450
harm the collectivity of Sahaja Yoga.

185
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:40,600
Your relations - brothers, sisters, mother, 
father, they're all right, but your main responsibility

186
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
is Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,820
Instead of that, you get involved into these 
things, you will definitely harm the collectivity

188
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,730
of Sahaja Yoga and create a politics out of 
it.

189
00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:01,270
The second discipline, is that your relationship 
is only with Sahaja Yogis and with nobody

190
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,600
else.

191
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,030
This is very important.

192
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:14,530
This is what I have to tell you very clearly 
that nobody is important but Sahaja Yogis.

193
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:20,450
Of course, you have to meet others, you have 
to talk to others, you have to deal with them,

194
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,860
you have to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, that 
is there, no doubt.

195
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,020
But, you cannot let down a Sahaja Yogi.

196
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:39,270
Among yourself if you have differences, sort 
them out and when you are outside, then you

197
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,200
should appear as one.

198
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,830
If you know the truth, there should be no 
differences.

199
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,730
Why should there be differences?

200
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,550
If there are differences, then you should 
find out that something is wrong with you,

201
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:57,860
definitely, and what is, is wrong is, that 
you are self-centered or you're worried about

202
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:05,370
something, which is, which is not Sahaja.

203
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,540
Even to follow my example may be difficult.

204
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:20,470
Now I have My children and My grandchildren, 
I never telephone to them, never.

205
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:27,001
As it is, I never telephone to them.

206
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,001
I am never bothered.

207
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,190
I see my husband so much worried about them, 
always telephones them.

208
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,360
I never.

209
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,100
Firstly, I know they are all right.

210
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:48,900
Firstly, I know I've done my duty, and I'm 
not going to waste My life only on My children

211
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:57,840
or on My husband or on My family because My 
family is the whole universe.

212
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,780
So you have to expand.

213
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,201
Sahaja Yogis have to expand themselves.

214
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:10,030
If they're just interested in their own family, 
in their own children, in their own properties,

215
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,060
is going to be difficult.

216
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,830
So this self-centeredness has to go.

217
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:24,760
This self-centeredness has to go completely 
and you have to have a very wider vision of

218
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,880
life.

219
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:53,901
This is a very big compulsion for us, as Sahaja 
Yogis that we belong to the family of the

220
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,380
universe.

221
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,450
So, just like in the marriages now.

222
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:08,400
We started saying, "I don't like, I don't 
want to marry an Indian."

223
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,410
Some Indians say, "I don't want to marry a 
foreigner."

224
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:18,100
If you are so small-minded, you should not 
ask for marriage.

225
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:26,880
You should not ask me that I should marry 
you because we have to transcend completely,

226
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,240
all these petty ideas about our own religion, 
about our own race, about our own country.

227
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,270
If you cannot do it, you are not a Sahaja 
Yogi.

228
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,150
From your heart, you must expand.

229
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:47,380
That is very important.

230
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:57,620
Thus, the problem in India is of, say, caste 
system, which is - I can't understand.

231
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:04,780
I've told hundred times that in the Gita, 
it's described that in everybody resides the

232
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
spirit.

233
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,940
So how can you have caste?

234
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,950
But you can have according to your aptitude, 
that's different.

235
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,420
But you cannot have caste according to birth.

236
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:23,230
There's so many examples to prove that, but 
in India we have this curse of caste system.

237
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,660
And in the West, is even worse, is the racialism.

238
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,790
It is such a horrible thing called racialism.

239
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:39,940
For example, I went to Romania and I saw so 
many Gypsies there.

240
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,850
They're treated just like dogs.

241
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,070
So low they were looked upon.

242
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,670
These Gypsies are really nice people, nothing 
wrong with them.

243
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,400
At least their character is good.

244
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,960
They have certain principle for their women 
and they lead a good life of morality.

245
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,670
They are collective people, but they are treated 
so badly, so shabbily, that even in India,

246
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,230
I won't find that kind of a thing happening.

247
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,780
Racialism.

248
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:22,830
Now, Romanians have no particular race, as 
such.

249
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:32,500
You cannot say they are Germans or English 
or Anglo-Saxons, nothing.

250
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,300
I was surprised there more than anywhere else.

251
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,690
Also in England, the same thing.

252
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:46,910
They are treated very badly and these are 
people of great art and very loving.

253
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:52,920
And I was surprised that so many came to our 
program also.

254
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:59,830
So the attention should be on a wider vision 
of life and towards the people who are suffering,

255
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,150
is very important.

256
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:11,450
You must look after the people who are suffering, 
who are in trouble, who need your help, not

257
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:19,130
to make friends with people who will help 
you in money or in any other way but be friendly

258
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,620
with the people who are downtrodden.

259
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:27,190
We have become Sahaja Yogis to help them to 
come up.

260
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:36,950
We have to do something for them and in Vashi 
I'm starting a center where the poor people

261
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,580
will be treated free.

262
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:51,030
Though we are in the middle, we have to help 
the people who are not enjoying any benefit

263
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,040
of life.

264
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,390
We have to take them to Sahaja Yoga, We have 
to help them in every way that is possible.

265
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:06,700
Now, you must have noticed that in the wedding 
lists, what I have done is to create a balance

266
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:16,710
between, say, the developing countries and 
the developed countries, to make an proper

267
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,720
exchange.

268
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,960
Then I find there are people who are very 
arrogant about it.

269
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,980
Now, English girls are supposed to be Christians, 
French girls are supposed to be Christians

270
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,760
and so many others.

271
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,580
Christ, who did so much for the downtrodden, 
these people, when they get married, they

272
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:43,660
try to show off and look down upon people, 
they are Sahaja Yogis and now we have turned

273
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,640
down all the Christian girls from England 
because for the same reason.

274
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:58,370
A funny type of a superiority complex if you 
develop, that's not being Christian at all.

275
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,060
And that's why we have to understand, as Sahaja 
Yogis, that the one of the principle of Sahaja

276
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:10,880
Yoga is that you should get over all these 
minor things and all these limitations from

277
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,580
which we have been suffering and others have 
been suffering.

278
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:27,960
When we come to this collective happening, 
we have to understand that people have to

279
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,110
be collective.

280
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,400
Because we should have big palaces where we 
can go and meditate or should we have huge

281
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
things?

282
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,270
Not necessary.

283
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,500
To pray and to meditate, any place is all 
right.

284
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,160
Anywhere you are there, you can enjoy, you 
should enjoy there.

285
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,850
You should not demand things.

286
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:57,540
Like when you come to Ganapatipule, I know 
it's not very comfortable.

287
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:05,950
It's not even a three star hotel arrangement, 
but you enjoy each other and you love each

288
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:13,860
other, and the company of every one of you 
is the comfort giving.

289
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:26,340
What gives you comfort is the love, affection, 
oneness, the unity between yourself.

290
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,940
Then you don't care, you don't care what comforts 
you have, what happiness you have.

291
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,410
This time, suddenly, you know, there were 
250 more came than expected, so we had to

292
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:46,610
put the, these temporary things for you and 
you didn't mind.

293
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,790
I am very thankful to you for that.

294
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:59,510
So complete tolerance and comfort of the body 
is not important - comfort of the spirit.

295
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:07,200
If your body wants comfort, you try to make 
it learn to give up that.

296
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:19,590
Try to make your body your slave and not you 
the slave of the body.

297
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,402
This if you don't try, then in Sahaja Yoga, 
you are nowhere because then you will again

298
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:31,160
say, "I must have a beautiful car, then must 
I have a house, then I must have this, must

299
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,600
have that."

300
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:41,570
If you care for your body too much, then the 
spirit, the light of the spirit goes down.

301
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:50,660
There's no glow on your face and there's no 
peace in your mind because, all the time,

302
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:58,570
you're worried about your body, about your 
comforts, about your food, about this, about

303
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,570
that.

304
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,590
You can leave all these things to the Divine.

305
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:11,530
What you have to do to see yourself, that 
in your behavior, you should be honest, you

306
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,659
should be spiritual and you should be surrendering.

307
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,819
That's your job.

308
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:22,899
You have to see, "Am I surrendering or not?

309
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:25,030
Am I fully with Sahaja Yoga or not?

310
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,159
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

311
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,070
What I should do for Sahaja Yoga?"

312
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,060
If you don't do this way, the mind will work 
the other way round.

313
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,099
It will start thinking, "Oh, this is not good 
for my child.

314
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,550
That's not good.

315
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,000
This is this."

316
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,529
Once you start thinking what have I to do 
for Sahaja Yoga?

317
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:44,149
What have I to work out for Sahaja Yoga?

318
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:51,940
How I have to spread Sahaja Yoga?, you'll 
be surprised your mind will get into the aura

319
00:34:51,940 --> 00:35:00,119
of spirituality and nobody has to tell you 
anything, it will just work automatically.

320
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:06,839
You have the power, you have everything, you 
have the fountain, which has to be opened

321
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,130
out.

322
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,430
So we come to another point that we should 
realize what we are.

323
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,850
This is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,590
Christ has said, "I am the Son of God."

325
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,810
All right.

326
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:29,750
He said it openly, though people crucified 
Him for that, but He said it.

327
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:37,190
He said it openly, "I am the Son of God.

328
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,869
Do what you like."

329
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:45,920
Which was a fact, which was the truth He was 
supposed to say.

330
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:55,240
So now, the Sahaj Yogis have to say, "I am 
the son or daughter of Adi Shakti."

331
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,569
Once you say to yourself that, suddenly you'll 
start changing because it's a very big position.

332
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:09,630
It's a very anointed position.

333
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,859
Once you start saying that, then you'll start 
understanding what is your responsibility.

334
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,869
You'll be amazed.

335
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:23,170
Those people have been to wrong gurus, when 
they come to Sahaja Yoga, they become extremely

336
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:30,570
generous and extremely dedicated, extremely 
humble because they have suffered so much.

337
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:37,240
Sometimes, those who come directly do not 
have that feeling.

338
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,450
What you have got, you know better when you 
have gone through some ordeals, but if you

339
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,990
get it Sahaja, then they don't understand.

340
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:55,200
So, we have to also introspect all the time.

341
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,099
The first introspection is that, Am I humble?

342
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:07,540
Can I 
humble down myself before anyone?

343
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:13,720
That's very important, but temper is the worst 
thing.

344
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,049
Krishna has said, "From the temper, everything 
bad starts."

345
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:23,869
Temper starts from liver; so you can cure 
your liver.

346
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:29,930
But temper you can see yourself, how your 
temper is bad and how you want to get rid

347
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,599
of the temper.

348
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,440
Temper will kill all the collectivity.

349
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,029
Temper will blur all the beauty of spirituality.

350
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:47,240
A person who is very hot tempered and talks 
of God, people will say, "Let's run away from

351
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,609
this man."

352
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,740
So the temper you have to get rid of.

353
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:00,920
It's very important to introspect on what 
points you get angry.

354
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,809
Some people think it's a matter of right for 
them to get angry.

355
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:10,560
All right, but not in Sahaj Yoga.

356
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,550
You don't have to get angry.

357
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,770
You don't have to shout at anyone.

358
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,229
You don't have to beat anyone.

359
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:18,960
If there is any problem, you can tell Me.

360
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:27,210
But I have seen people fighting, quarrelling 
sometime and I'm amazed how these people are

361
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,089
quarrelling among themselves.

362
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:36,990
Gradually, I'm sure, as you'll grow in spirituality, 
all these fights and quarrels and what you

363
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:42,000
call the different grouping ideas will drop 
out.

364
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,200
But Sahaja Yoga will not allow you to stay 
in it.

365
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,329
You'll be exposed immediately.

366
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,230
People will know about you.

367
00:38:52,230 --> 00:39:01,579
So try to understand why you get angry, why 
you have temper, what is the reason, what

368
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,049
you don't like in other people may be within 
you.

369
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:08,329
Same thing may be existing within you.

370
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:14,859
So, is a cleansing process in Sahaja Yoga, 
which is very important and we need the help

371
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:17,710
of Christ very much.

372
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,050
Because there is rationality that covers your 
Agnya.

373
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,329
You can rationalize everything.

374
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,329
Everything.

375
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:31,369
Even if you kill somebody, you can rationalize 
it.

376
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:41,380
So this Agnya is also our enemy if we cannot 
keep it open.

377
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,440
Absolutely.

378
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,920
Because we can justify ourself.

379
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,510
We can say, "What can I do?

380
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,259
It happened like that and this thing."

381
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:56,809
Once you start, get after yourself; all these 
things will go away.

382
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:06,840
If you're getting angry very much, stand before 
the mirror and try to get angry with yourself.

383
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,560
Then attachments.

384
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,930
Attachments are very subtle.

385
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:21,150
Formerly, what I had known about the western 
Sahaja Yogis, they didn't love their children

386
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,589
very well.

387
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:27,369
Now, I find they're glued to their children.

388
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:32,150
And they want to move the whole movement of 
Sahaja Yoga according to the whims of their

389
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,150
children.

390
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:40,130
Also, Indian Sahaja Yogis are like that.

391
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,640
They're very attached to their children.

392
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,329
They are, they have been always very attached 
to their children.

393
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:53,099
I've already explained to you that attachment 
is the death of love.

394
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:58,580
If you love somebody, then love everyone according 
to the need of that person.

395
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,880
You have to move.

396
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,819
You cannot just stick into one point.

397
00:41:04,819 --> 00:41:07,819
That is not your responsibility.

398
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:13,230
That is the responsibility of the Divine and 
leave it to Divine and you will see.

399
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:18,289
Your children will improve, your relationships 
will improve, everything will improve because

400
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:20,849
it's not your responsibility.

401
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:33,910
Your limitations will affect all these relations 
and I should actually say that this limited

402
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:40,950
relationship will, might, also suffocate the 
relations.

403
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:51,380
So I have a very wider vision and a wider 
understanding how far you are.

404
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,910
If you come in the nature, you can learn it 
very well.

405
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,910
See the water.

406
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,480
It's coming to all the trees.

407
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,130
Everyone is blessed.

408
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,240
It doesn't stick to any, any one tree or anywhere.

409
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,369
If it does that, the whole thing will be finished.

410
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:16,170
If you have to think of collectivity, you 
have to be very much detached and not driven

411
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:29,800
or persuaded into some sort of a small little 
relationships.

412
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,650
It's much easier for you to follow Sahaja 
Yoga than anybody else in the world could

413
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,880
have followed because others were not realized 
souls.

414
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,500
You are all realized souls.

415
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:56,980
There are other attachments - attachments 
to money.

416
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:10,960
Very surprising, like they treat Sahaja Yoga 
sometimes like a shop or a market.

417
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,069
So they'll say, "Mother, can You make it half 
rate?

418
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:18,600
Can You make it quarter rate?

419
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,069
Can You give us some concession?

420
00:43:21,069 --> 00:43:22,650
Some sale, you know."

421
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:32,490
There are at least thirty-five percent people 
are coming free.

422
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:41,970
And those who can pay want to have half, less 
than half, but I don't know what to say to

423
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,040
them.

424
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:51,970
I mean this is the only chance where you can 
really give some money, which is, of course,

425
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,160
shared, I agree.

426
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,700
It's not all that money is needed for one 
person, but you can share, very easily with

427
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,150
others, because they don't have that much 
money to come to this country, they don't

428
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,650
have that much money to live here.

429
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:11,519
As we are talking about global life, we have 
to understand that we have to share money

430
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,210
with them.

431
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,570
If you start understanding only this much, 
I tell you, your attachment to money will

432
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,570
go away.

433
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:25,519
That you have to share.

434
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,650
You don't want to share anything.

435
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,190
You may have crores, but you don't want to 
share.

436
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,990
In Sahaja Yoga, so many people have become 
very rich, but they don't want to share.

437
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:43,859
I'm not saying that we are here for money 
or anything, but main point is, fundamental

438
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,930
point, is the attitude should be of sharing 
with others.

439
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,450
Sahaja Yoga has given us so much.

440
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,000
What have we done for it?

441
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,320
Where are we sharing?

442
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,839
On the other side, we have people who are 
very - very greedy who want more.

443
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:10,869
There are some people who go on borrowing 
money, some people who go on using people

444
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:15,080
for their own purposes.

445
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,280
All these petty, nonsensical things are not 
for Sahaja Yogis.

446
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,300
You don't need.

447
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,819
Whatever you need, you just ask, you'll get 
it.

448
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:31,940
So some people are trying to exploit some 
people and some people are trying to save

449
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,460
themselves.

450
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,450
There should be an open mind.

451
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:47,380
As your Sahasrara is open here - you know, 
this is the Heart Chakra here and this Heart

452
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,619
Chakra opens, then the Sahasrara opens.

453
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:58,210
Open your hearts, open your hearts, then only 
you can enjoy yourself.

454
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,640
Now supposing I want to see something with 
My eyes and My eyes are closed, can I see

455
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,829
something and enjoy that?

456
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:11,070
If you have to feel something from your heart, 
your heart is closed, how can you?

457
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,030
How can you feel that?

458
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,190
So open your heart.

459
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,309
Open your heart.

460
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:31,230
In this way, you'll realize that things are 
not so difficult.

461
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:40,490
It's all for us very easy, but we have to 
open our heart and respect each other.

462
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,512
Sahaja Yogis must respect each other.

463
00:46:42,512 --> 00:46:49,640
Somebody is black, somebody is white, somebody 
is tall, somebody is short, somebody is like

464
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
that.

465
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,710
God has made a variety otherwise we would 
all have been like a regimentation.

466
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:04,109
So we should enjoy the variety that makes 
the beauty, beauty of creation.

467
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:12,240
So all these outward things should not in 
any way impress you.

468
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:20,109
People should be clean, neat, tidy - that's 
different.

469
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:22,309
But everybody should be like you is wrong.

470
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:33,609
In India especially, if you speak English 
not very correctly, then he is condemned,

471
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:37,220
as a scheduled caste.

472
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,529
It's such slavish mentality, very slavish.

473
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:46,329
Whether you know your language or not, your 
mother tongue or not, Hindi or not, doesn't

474
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,329
matter.

475
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:48,329
You must know English.

476
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,490
If somebody says "English", he is finished.

477
00:47:52,490 --> 00:48:01,500
Well, I have seen Japanese, Chinese, French, 
anyone else speaks horrible, I mean funny

478
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:13,749
English, I should say, but the worst are the 
English themselves.

479
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:17,849
English have lost the sense of English completely, 
but what's so much in that?

480
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:25,509
It's nothing but a slavish mentality to one 
regime, which was here for three hundred years

481
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:33,509
and did nothing good to themselves, went empty 
handed from here.

482
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:42,890
Even the Christians in India believe that 
Christ was born in England, do you believe

483
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,890
that?

484
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,289
Most of them.

485
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:55,690
So the essence of a life is to be proud of 
whatever country we are born of, we must love

486
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:01,150
our own country, but we should not identify 
with it.

487
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,880
All the wrongs of that country we should criticize 
and we should see.

488
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,640
We should not accept them and should not become 
a part and parcel of those absurd people who

489
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,770
have their limitations.

490
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,359
Do you transcend your countries?

491
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:20,109
You transcend all these limitations.

492
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:22,029
You have become great now.

493
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:29,400
How can you remain in a small little pond?

494
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,400
You need an ocean.

495
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,599
You'll get suffocated.

496
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,730
Another thing is, you should not use things 
made by machine so much.

497
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:47,999
Try to avoid, as far as possible.

498
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:52,350
These machines have created so many problems 
for us.

499
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:59,609
We should wear something that is made by hand 
or by people who are using small, little,

500
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:07,740
sort of, we can call, ordinary machines, which 
does not require so much of smoke to come

501
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,779
out.

502
00:50:08,779 --> 00:50:13,960
We should be very conscious of ecological 
problems as Sahaja Yogis.

503
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,289
But one thing I know, where there are Sahaja 
Yogis the ecological problems also gets solved

504
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:22,930
because of vibrations.

505
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,900
But vibrations will only fight when you are 
willing to fight ecology.

506
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:35,279
Everywhere you go, you find so much of pollution, 
so much of pollution.

507
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:38,970
How to fight this pollution?

508
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:44,190
Is to be paying attention to the ecology.

509
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:50,830
Are we producing all those things, which is 
spoiling the atmosphere?

510
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,950
We are responsible, we have to do it.

511
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,809
Who is going to do it?

512
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:05,839
So one side, as I told you, we have to look 
after the people who are poorer than us, who

513
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,839
are unfortunate.

514
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:13,670
We have to look after the atmosphere which 
is filled with all nonsensical things and

515
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:25,380
take to a lifestyle, which lifestyle will 
be simpler, by which we don't use so many,

516
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:33,579
so many vehicles and so many things which 
are creating problems.

517
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:39,280
Like in Dehra Dhun they told me they have 
so many of these three-wheelers that the buses

518
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
have stopped.

519
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
Why?

520
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,720
Because in the three-wheeler you pay some 
money less, so they go by the three-wheeler

521
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,730
and it creates all the black soot all over.

522
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:56,710
A Sahaja Yogi should never sit in a three-wheeler 
to save some money.

523
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:04,259
It's better to walk or use a vehicle which 
doesn't give much of these things.

524
00:52:04,259 --> 00:52:13,569
They are so many ways by which we can really 
be very supportive of this ecological problem

525
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:20,820
because it is a part of our, part of our responsibility.

526
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:29,690
Till the age of forty-seven, I was wearing 
only pure khadi, pure khadi, not even silk,

527
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,999
till the age of forty-seven.

528
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:42,779
Then when this Sahasrara was broken, then 
I started wearing other clothes.

529
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:51,140
Our life should be such that we should feel 
sensitive to every growth around us.

530
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:57,329
It is only our attention, how you put your 
attention to things.

531
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:04,950
Like now, there are so many new things are 
coming up in India, everywhere.

532
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:14,200
One day, I told somebody that why didn't you 
get some quails from Germany?

533
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,890
He said, "I don't know.

534
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,890
There is quail in Germany?"

535
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:17,890
I said, "There is a big industry of quails.

536
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,890
What do you say?"

537
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:19,890
"How do you know, Mother?"

538
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,369
I said, "I know."

539
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:30,280
Once I go to a country, I know everything 
about that, all the details about it.

540
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,759
I was surprised that such a big industry they 
had, they never knew they had quails.

541
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:42,000
In the same way, in our own country, we don't 
know what we have, what artistic things we

542
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,999
have, what is, what is the one that is, that 
will help the poor.

543
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:52,970
We never know about it.

544
00:53:52,970 --> 00:54:00,859
Why Christ was born in those conditions because 
He wanted to give blessings to those poor

545
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:07,430
people, to help them with spirituality.

546
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:14,259
But we are not bothered, we are not bothered 
to see where the poverty is and how we can

547
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:15,259
help.

548
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:21,660
You can, by all means, you can help them in 
every corner, in every way.

549
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:30,289
It's very simple to understand about your 
own country, where the problem is, why people

550
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:35,079
are poor and we cannot help them.

551
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,799
We have to take to this.

552
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:42,829
Unless and until your light shines in the 
society, we are doing nothing.

553
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:49,150
We are just enjoying our own Sahaja Yoga, 
Ganapatipule and all that.

554
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,569
But what about others?

555
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:59,980
So sensitivity to art, sensitivity to music, 
sensitivity to all creative things that are

556
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:06,390
there and what can we do with these creative 
things for others.

557
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:12,660
The attention should be more towards these 
things than about useless things.

558
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,740
Politics you shouldn't worry so much.

559
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,890
It will be all exposed and finished and it 
will be alright.

560
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:22,440
Let them fight, let them do what they like.

561
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,630
They're stupid people.

562
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:32,750
Your attention should be how you can be creative, 
how you can help people, how what you can

563
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,750
do.

564
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:42,289
In everything there's one thing - is Love, 
what you call is compassion, Anukampa, just

565
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:47,819
out of love and affection and that should 
be an real innate expression of every Sahaja

566
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:51,890
Yogi in every field of life.

567
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,644
I don't like this, I don't like that, this 
kind of a person is never a Sahaja Yogi.

568
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,760
The one who says, "I like."

569
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:06,349
My throat was not all right, but somebody 
brought some fruit.

570
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:11,150
Just to please, I ate it.

571
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:17,539
Doesn't matter what, little bit, I did eat.

572
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:21,700
Just to please you, I wore such a heavy saree.

573
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,480
None of you can wear it, I can tell you.

574
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,020
Just to please you.

575
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,299
So what are we doing to please others?

576
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:31,299
You should be a pleasing personality.

577
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:37,329
Instead of thinking about how you should be 
pleased, I don't like this, I don't do like

578
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:44,099
that, instead of, what have I done to please 
others?

579
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:53,079
To please the Divine, our character, our behavior 
should be absolutely clean.

580
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:57,540
I know Sahaja Yogis have done wonders and 
they are doing very well, but they can do

581
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,130
much, much, much more than what they are doing.

582
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:07,589
So on this day of Christ's birthday, I have 
to tell you that it is not possible to follow

583
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:09,549
His life, I agree.

584
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:10,549
Very difficult.

585
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:19,029
But at least, one has to learn from Him that 
He is before us and let us try to go forward

586
00:57:19,029 --> 01:03:32,219
towards Him, in His simplicity, in His honesty 
and the sacrifices

587
01:03:32,219 --> 01:04:13,029
He could make.

588
01:04:13,029 --> 01:57:06,340
May God bless you.
