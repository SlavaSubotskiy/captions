1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,530
So beautiful it was,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,500
that you all could come and give me such a surprise.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Of course I love you very much, no doubt.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,400
My love is not mental, is not emotional,

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,540
it’s existence itself.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,780
I exist with it. It’s my innate nature,

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,020
which I could not enjoy unless and until it is reflected.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,760
It has to be reflected,

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,540
and today I felt the reflection in you people.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,600
I was so overjoyed, so very overjoyed.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,220
Everything seems so beautiful.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,780
All these petty problems that trouble you,

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,960
and sometimes try to bother Me also,

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,440
just disappeared.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,740
You just felt that everybody is so cleansed and so beautiful,

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,340
everybody’s ego washed off

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,140
and the nectar of the beauty of love is just

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,360
pouring into them.

19
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,540
It’s not easy to describe,

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,260
that was Nirananda, I felt it today,

21
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
complete Nirananda.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,800
To feel Your own joy reflected is something so

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,960
boundless that You cannot put them

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,380
into the limitations of words.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,200
You have given me the greatest joy today

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,760
and a very great feeling

27
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:08,260
that Sahaja Yoga now will be established very well

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,140
in Germany especially.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,620
I always felt about Germany

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
that it needed a special help

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,620
and the way you all have rushed here

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
is something like a place,

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,320
say, in the hand or in the feet, there is some pain,

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,160
so all the attention moves towards that, like that.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,880
Germany is a very strong nation

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
and if you could take them to Sahaja Yoga,

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,700
we’ll have that metal within us. It’s very important.

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Every country has something special.

39
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,540
The metal of Germany is very important

40
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,440
and if that comes into us, we’ll have that courage.

41
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,160
So may God bless you all for that.
